In particular, the fast mode-change capability of battery and its corresponding impacts on its frequency support ability is investigated through dynamic modelling of the 100 MW Hornsdale battery during the August 2018 separation events in Australia. In this regard, a converter-based battery dynamic model is presented which includes current- bidirectional DC-DC converter, thereby being able to observe its fast mode change as a response to severe frequency excursions. Also, an active power-frequency characteristic is proposed which considers the impact of battery pre-contingency operating point on its available headroom for primary frequency response provision. Moreover, an active power reference generation strategy is suggested which takes into account regulation FCAS provision through automatic generation control (AGC) as well as contingency FCAS provision through droop controller. Finally, it will be shown how BESS installed in Victoria might have potentially prevented the severity of the August 2018 event by prevention of both under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) and secondary photovoltaic (PV) trip.",IEEE Xplore,2019 9th International Conference on Power and Energy Systems (ICPES)

In order to overcome these weaknesses, system state transition models for eight types of failure event have been established and a ""generalized n+2 state system Markov model"" is proposed in this paper. Factors such as detailed switching procedures, stuck breaker conditions and normally open components can be incorporated using the generalized model. The numerical comparisons show that the differences between the results calculated using the generalized n+2 state system model and three state component model are significant in some cases, particularly for high level outages, The generalized n+2 state system model is a more accurate model compared to the conventional three state model. It allows more factors to be considered and is more flexible in form.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems

By modeling the transition probabilities between the SMP states and the sojourn time of each SMP state, the mean times to compromise (MTTCs) of the normal and penetration attacks are calculated. With increased probabilities of breaker trips resulted from the cyber attacks, the loss of load probabilities (LOLP) are evaluated based on IEEE reliability test system 79 (RTS79).

Our attestation evaluation adopts a graph-based method to represent integrity violations, and the graph-based policy analysis is further augmented with a ranked violation graph to support high semantic reasoning of attestation results.

Users can access application servers in MEC instead of routing to the internet by passing through a core cellular network. Few security challenges arise as the traffic does not traverse through the core network, and these can be solved by providing authentication services in the MEC. However, authentication and application mobility issues arise in the case of multiple MECs where a user is mobile and needs continuous service from application servers, without needing to establish a new session and providing authentication information repeatedly to every new MEC the user connects with. In this work, with improved survey, real-time cellular network testbed deployment, more results, and detailed security analysis., we propose two solutions, a TC3A (Token-based Cookie transfer & 3rd-party Authentication) and a TS3A (Token-based State transfer & 3rd-party Authentication) for resolution of authentication and application mobility issues while achieving low latency. We conducted experiments on a testbed that had MECs deployed in a real-time cellular network (emulated via OpenAirInterface) and performed user handover between two MECs. The experimental results show that TC3A and TS3A successfully re-authenticate the users, without provision of login credentials with target MEC, while reducing the latency by approximately 49.76–59.72% as compared to simple login method. The TC3A and TS3A also eliminate the need of keeping multiple accounts for applications at different MECs and most importantly provide application service continuity, through state transfer during cross-system handover, which is not provided by a simple login method. TC3A provides the application service continuity without any loss of session state, which is suitable for applications that cannot afford state loss, and TS3A provides the same while reducing the latency by 47.05–51.25% as compared to TC3A, which is suitable for applications that require low latency.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management

Al-Ammar,10.1109/NSS.2009.16,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5319315,2009.0,IEEE Conferences,"Power system operation aims, in principle, at maintaining reliable and secure supply of electricity while minimizing the total cost of operation. In theory, there are two main objectives that could be considered, namely the maximization of system security and the minimization of total operating cost of supplying energy. In practice, however, the security requirements are included as constraints rather than formulating the problem as a security maximization mandate. The system security constraints are in fact boundaries that surround all possible operating modes (scenarios) of the power system. In other words, these boundaries form the feasible operating domain in the parameter space spanned by various operating variables within which the system can safely be operated. For a given operating scenario, the associated security level is measured by the ""distance"" (for example, the Euclidean norm) of the operating point from the security region boundary. This paper presents a novel framework for identification and representation of operating security regions in power systems as well as evaluation of security levels associated with different operating scenarios. While the concepts and principles presented are general, the work of this the paper is confined to the interpretation of the security boundary in terms of system stability criteria. Of course, the framework presented is applicable quite as well to other criteria that may be considered.",IEEE Xplore,2009 Third International Conference on Network and System Security

Experiments and analysis show that client arrival rate is not sufficient for making an adaptation decision. The average requested file size and the client session duration play key roles in the performance effect of such an adaptation.

A joint reserve scheduling model considering the cross-sectorial impacts of operation uncertainties is essential but still insufficient to guarantee the reliable operation of the integrated electricity and natural gas system (IEGS). Therefore, this paper proposes a day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model for the IEGS to schedule the operation and reserve si-multaneously considering reliability requirements. Firstly, the multi-state models for generating units and gas wells are established. Based on the multi-state models, the expected unserved energy cost (EUEC) and the expected wind curtailment cost (EWC) criteria are proposed based on probabilistic methods considering wind fluctuation and random failures of components in IEGS. Furthermore, the EUEC and EWC criteria are incorporated into the day-ahead SCUC model, which is noncon-vex and mathematically reformulated into a solvable mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) problem. The proposed model is validated using an IEEE 30-bus system and Belgium 20-node natural gas system. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively schedule the energy reserve to guarantee the reliable operation of the IEGS considering the multiple uncertainties in different subsystems and the cross-sectorial failure propagation.",IEEE Xplore,Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy

The appropriate implementation of numerous cloud computing models aids firms in digital transformation and development with maximum productivity. However, CC integration with IoT allows an extraordinary capability and boosts economies’ ability to develop at a fast pace. Meanwhile, due to the rapid expansion of IoT, the current cloud network cannot keep abreast of the growing data loads and processing extremities, particularly in real-time. Even the most cutting-edge cloud providers are experiencing an inordinate strain as a result of the growing number of consumer and corporate devices connected to the IoT.

High latency, lack of location awareness, outage concerns, etc., are among the issues that cloud services for IoT confront.

Sentinel provides researchers access to virtual computing infrastructure and petabytes of data collected over several years from network sensors at two large, disjoint educational institutions - the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech. The network dataset is supplemented by multi-modal malware activity logs generated by attack recreation exercises which realistically integrate ground truth into collected edge sensor data. To mitigate risks associated with providing access to enterprise network sensor logs, Sentinel uses a combination of a code-to-data policy, data usage agreements, and pattern-preserving anonymization.

The condensation algorithm is a kind of ""factored sampling"" and it can easily cope with multi-modal probability density of objects' positions. We track objects not in images but in 3D space. We use a condensation particle-set as a tracker and represent a position of a moving object by a center of tracker.

First, the K nearest neighbors (KNN) in the LLE algorithm are selected adaptively by the Gaussian weighted KNN algorithm. Then, the low dimensional sub-epidemic of high dimensional data is extracted by the LLE algorithm, and the mapping matrix from high-dimensional data to low-dimensional data is obtained by local linear regression.

Virtualization introduces additional overhead that often relates to memory management, interrupt handling and hypervisor mode switching. Among those, memory management and translation lookaside buffer (TLB) management have been shown to have a significant impact on the performance of systems. Two principal mechanisms for TLB management exist in today's systems, namely software and hardware managed TLBs. In this paper, we analyze and quantify the overhead of a pure software virtualization that is implemented over a software managed TLB. We then describe our design of hardware extensions to support virtualization in systems with software managed TLBs to remove the most dominant overheads. These extensions were implemented in the Power embedded A2 core, which is used in the PowerEN and in the Blue Gene/Q processors. They were used to implement a KVM port. We evaluate each of these hardware extensions to determine their overall contributions to performance and efficiency.

The problem with this approach is that students will most likely end up using some other different framework or technology if ever they decide to become professional web developers. Our students need to learn concepts and skills that serve as a foundation to learn whatever different technologies are used now or happen to appear in the future. This poster presents the author's experience on using a bottom-up approach to teach the fundamental aspects of how the HTTP protocol works, and how this knowledge can be used to get a deep understanding of the inner workings of the web by building a simple yet complete server-side web framework. Using Node.js as the development platform, students are able to take TCP sockets as the building blocks for higher-level web abstractions. This approach allows covering a variety of specific topics that are essential for a professional web developer: request and response structure and headers, HTTP methods, form processing, cookies and sessions, text encodings, MVC software architectural pattern, database integration using ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture, security issues (HTTPS protocol, common web vulnerabilities), and client-side integration using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).

However, certain modalities may be incomplete or unavailable because of the restricted imaging conditions, which commonly leads to decision bias in many real-world applications. Despite the significant advancement of existing image synthesis techniques, learning complementary information from multi-modal inputs remains challenging. To address this problem, we propose an autoencoder-based collaborative attention generative adversarial network (ACA-GAN) that uses available multi-modal images to generate the missing ones. The collaborative attention mechanism deploys a single-modal attention module and a multi-modal attention module to effectively extract complementary information from multiple available modalities. Considering the significant modal gap, we further developed an autoencoder network to extract the self-representation of target modality, guiding the generative model to fuse target-specific information from multiple modalities. This considerably improves cross-modal consistency with the desired modality, thereby greatly enhancing the image synthesis performance. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons for various multi-modal image synthesis tasks highlight the superiority of our approach over several prior methods by demonstrating more precise and realistic results.

Recently, leveraging the supervised or semi-unsupervised learning paradigms, which benefits from the large-scale datasets and strong computing performance, has achieved a competitive performance on a specific target domain. However, when Re-ID models are directly deployed in a new domain without target samples, they always suffer from considerable performance degradation and poor domain generalization. To address this challenge, we propose a Deep Multimodal Representation Learning network to elaborate rich semantic knowledge for assisting in representation learning during the pre-training. Importantly, a multimodal representation learning strategy is introduced to translate the features of different modalities into the common space, which can significantly boost generalization capability of Re-ID model. As for the fine-tuning stage, a realistic dataset is adopted to fine-tune the pre-trained model for better distribution alignment with real-world data.

The connection of wind farms may affect the original oscillation modes of the system, and may also introduce new oscillation modes. To ensure the security and stability of the system, it is necessary to assess the running state of the system and evaluate the development direction of the small signal stability on the premise of taking volatility into account. It is also important to fast adjust the system when an unstable state happened. The method in this paper provides a new way to accurately evaluate and adjust the stability of the system integrated with wind farms. Broad learning system (BLS) is a non-fixed model and has the potential of incremental learning. A BLS model is trained to evaluate the damping ratio sensitivity in different operating states. The adjustment part will use the optimal adjustment model and damping ratio sensitivity to adjust unstable systems.

The security system designed for small-scale systems saves space and power using hardware adaptation by loading or creating only the required accelerator during execution of the application. It uses light weight cryptographic algorithms. A second design for large-scale systems focuses on getting more throughput by allocating more resources to the required accelerator at runtime.

Furthermore, security metrics are used to compute severity scores for detected vulnerabilities using a novel scoring system: Cloud Security Scoring System. CSBAuditor has been evaluated using various strategies including security chaos engineering (fault injection) strategies on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. CSBAuditor effectively detects misconfigurations in real-time with a detection rate of over 98%. Also, the performance overhead is within acceptable limits. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,Computers and Security

Harnessing the joint distribution of the different modalities by a learning model can be beneficial for critical applications for maintenance of the distributed systems. One such important task is the task of anomaly detection where we are interested in detecting the deviation of the current behaviour of the system from the theoretically expected. In this work, we utilize the joint representation from the distributed traces and system log data for the task of anomaly detection in distributed systems. We demonstrate that the joint utilization of traces and logs produced better results compared to the single modality anomaly detection methods. Furthermore, we formalize a learning task - next template prediction NTP, that is used as a generalization for anomaly detection for both logs and distributed trace. Finally, we demonstrate that this formalization allows for the learning of template embedding for both the traces and logs. The joint embeddings can be reused in other applications as good initialization for spans and logs. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)

Machine learning techniques are posing an increasingly important role in the field of malware identification and analysis. However, due to the complexity of the problem, the training of intelligent systems proves to be insufficient in recognizing advanced cyberthreats. The biggest challenge in information systems security using machine learning methods is to understand the polymorphism and metamorphism mechanisms used by malware developers and how to effectively address them. This work presents an innovative Artificial Evolutionary Fuzzy LSTM Immune System which, by using a heuristic machine learning method that combines evolutionary intelligence, Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and fuzzy knowledge, proves to be able to adequately protect modern information system from Portable Executable Malware. The main innovation in the technical implementation of the proposed approach is the fact that the machine learning system can only be trained from raw bytes of an executable file to determine if the file is malicious. The performance of the proposed system was tested on a sophisticated dataset of high complexity, which emerged after extensive research on PE malware that offered us a realistic representation of their operating states. The high accuracy of the developed model significantly supports the validity of the proposed method. The final evaluation was carried out with in-depth comparisons to corresponding machine learning algorithms and it has revealed the superiority of the proposed immune system.  © 2021 Jian Jiang and Fen Zhang.",Scopus,Security and Communication Networks

On the other hand, predicting the personality traits of customers without an online service log (e.g., first-time visitors and customers who only use a physical store) is challenging. In this paper, we present a multimodal approach to predict the personality of customers about whom only visual data collected using an in-store surveillance cameras are available.

As a main bearer of current Mobile Networks, LTE/LTE-A carries massive and important business data but is facing more and more serious attack situations, which makes the Security Measurement over it become necessary and important. However, current methods are usually designed from specific malicious detections, which cannot provide the user with a synthetic view of security evaluation. Meanwhile, as the massive amount and poor quality of networking data are considered, the efficiency and accuracy of the current security measurement methods are usually not good. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation basis (the collecting data) of security measurement over LTE/LTE-A networks, and propose an Adaptive Security Data Collection and Composition Recognition (ASDCCR) method for it.

In general, a smart terminal can be switched between the licensed modes (e.g. LTE) and the unlicensed modes (e.g. WiFi) according to user's demands (e.g. costs). The designed tradeoff is that the demands can be met by switching, but the security of wireless transmissions may be deteriorated, as the wireless communications can be overheard by the eavesdropper. The authors propose a transmission mode aware smart terminal scheduling (TM-STS) scheme to improve the security of wireless transmissions of a smart terminal. Moreover, they analyse the security-reliability tradeoff (SRT) of the TMSTS scheme. They also present the SRT of the conventional round-robin aided smart terminal scheduling (Rr-STS) scheme. Numerical results show that the TM-STS scheme outperforms the Rr-STS scheme in terms of its SRT, and reveal that increasing the number of smart terminals not only can upgrade the SRT of the TM-STS scheme, but also can be a major influence on the probability of mode switching between a licensed mode and an unlicensed mode of the TM-STS scheme. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.",Scopus,IET Communications

However, most of the current face-iris multimodal biometric systems acquire face and iris with different sensors which brings about the increase of capturing complexity and device cost. Besides, they are limited by the identification performance degradation under non-ideal scenarios. In order to address these problems, a robust single-sensor face and iris biometric identification system based on multimodal feature extraction (MFE) network is proposed. Only a single sensor is needed to obtain face and iris images in the proposed system, with the goal of improving recognition performance while minimizing sensor cost and acquisition time. The MFE network is designed as a general network module to extract both face and iris features and it is trained with a triplet framework to reduce intra-class variations and enlarge inter-class variations.

Despite extensive advances in facial anti-spoofing based on single-model image, little work has been devoted to multi-modal anti-spoofing, which is however widely encountered in real-world scenarios. Following the recent progress, this paper mainly focuses on multi-modal face antispoofing and aims to solve the following two challenges: (1) how to effectively fuse multi-modal information; and (2) how to effectively learn distinguishable features despite single cross-entropy loss. We propose a novel Multi-modal Multi-layer Fusion Convolutional Neural Network (mmfCNN), which targets at finding a discriminative model for recognizing the subtle differences between live and spoof faces. The mmfCNN can fully use different information provided by diverse modalities, which is based on a weight-adaptation aggregation approach. Specifically, we utilize a multi-layer fusion model to further aggregate the features from different layers, which fuses the low-, mid- and high-level information from different modalities in a unified framework. Moreover, a novel Average Binary Center (ABC) loss is proposed to maximize the dissimilarity between the features of live and spoof faces, which helps to stabilize the training to generate a robust and discriminative model. Extensive experiments conducted on the CISIA-SURF and 3DMAD datasets verify the significance and generalization capability of the proposed method for the face anti-spoofing task.

Individuals and business organizations alike have continued to fall prey to ransomware where victims have been forced to pay cybercriminals even up to $1 million in a single attack whilst others have incurred losses in hundreds of millions of dollars. Clearly, ransomware is an emerging cyber threat to enterprise systems that can no longer be ignored. In this paper, we address the evolution of the ransomware and the associated paradigm shifts in attack structures narrowing down to the technical and economic impacts. We formulate an attack model applicable to cascaded network design structures common in enterprise systems. We model the security state of the ransomware attack process as transitions of a finite state machine where state transitions depict breaches of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. We propose a ransomware categorization framework that classifies the virulence of a given ransomware based on a proposed classification algorithm that is based on data deletion and file encryption attack structures. The categories that increase in severity from CAT1 to CAT5 classify the technical prowess and the overall effectiveness of potential ways of retaining the data without paying the ransom demand.

Existing systems usually exploit attributes, like colors and types, or license plate numbers as keywords to find vehicles in the database. However, attribute based search cannot accurately find the target vehicle due to the minor inter-class difference between similar vehicles and the extremely varied environmental factors. Moreover, the license plates usually cannot be correctly recognized in real-world surveillance scenes due to the viewpoints and motion blur. In this paper, we design a progressive vehicle search system, PVSS, for surveillance networks. As a search engine, PVSS contains three main parts: the vehicle crawler, the vehicle indexer, and the vehicle searcher. The vehicle crawler performs vehicle detection and tracking on surveillance videos and sends the cropped vehicle images, camera IDs, and timestamps to the indexer server. The indexer extracts multi-grained visual features, including the appearance features and license plate features, to index the vehicle images in the cameras. In the search stage, given a query vehicle image, the time range, and the spatial scope, the system can search the target vehicle in a progressive manner, i.e., from-coarse-to-fine search with multi-grained features and from-near-to-distant search with the spatiotemporal context.

It is also like a graduated driver's license where the student must prove some proficiency with the VTPAC before being allowed to get behind the wheel. The VTPAC will be used to operate the real robot system too and will allow people to be trained without using real robotic systems in very safe environment. The VTPAC can be used for industrial training and can be integrated in the academic programs, especially for online courses. In this research, the Fanuc LR Mate 200iC robot and the Visual Components software have been selected as a case study. These choices were made because of the easy access to the Fanuc LR Mate 200iC and this interface by reason of it can control the robot the same way as the Teach Pendant in the real world.

This paper primarily lays emphasis on two methods that are Probabilistic Fuzzy Decision Tree (PFDT) and Case Based Reasoning (CBR). In PFDT, Decision Tree plays an integral role for classification of system. For further classification of power system security, an algorithm is developed to categorise the buses which trouble the security most. After classification of system, by using minimum amount of load curtailment of voltages on buses which made insecure to secure load. Optimization of load is done by curtailing reactive power from insecure buses. In CBR, old cases from database are used for solving the problems of new case. Hence, PFDT is re-trained in system during real operation for solving the new operating states which are found insecure in CBR approach.

One of the main concerns of major labels is how to prevent file sharing. An innovative approach that couples reviving catalogues with support for rights management could provide an experience of multimedia content in which users select multiple media streams on the fly in a fully synchronized environment. Because this kind of user experience can't be reconstructed from the single original streams, illegal copying would be intrinsically discouraged. In this article, the authors propose an approach to encode contents and build advanced multimodal interfaces that protect intellectual property.

With this, we can establish an individual on the basis of who the person is, rather than what does he possess or what he remembers. With the increase in security requirements and increase in forging of data, a single fold or unimodal biometric verification is not of much accuracy. Hence, there is a revolutionary implementation of combination of more than one biometric data which is called multimodal biometrics. In our research paper we would be going for a 4-fold security system where we will use fusion of facial recognition, retina pattern, and finger print pattern along with the personal password which would be recognised using keystroke dynamics.

Conventional x-ray attenuation (usually in dual-energy mode) is exploited to discriminate threat and non-Threat materials: This is essentially, a method that has seen little changes in decades. Our goal is to demonstrate that x-rays can be used in a different way to achieve improved detection of weapons and explosives. Our approach involves the use of x-ray phase contrast and it a) allows much higher sensitivity in the detection of object edges and b) can be made sensitive to the sample's microstructure. We believe that these additional channels of information, alongside conventional attenuation which would still be available, have the potential to significantly increase both sensitivity and specificity in baggage scanning. We obtained preliminary data demonstrating the above enhanced detection, and we built a scanner (currently in commissioning) to scale the concept up and test it on real baggage. In particular, while previous X-ray phase contrast imaging systems were limited in terms of both field of view (FOV) and maximum x-ray energy, this scanner overcomes both those limitations and provides FOVs up to 20 to 50 cm2 with x-ray energies up to 100 keV. © 2016 SPIE.",Scopus,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering

Hence came the first security system using passwords, these systems have evolved and started using biometrics traits instead of passwords. But people have found ways to cheat such systems through different means. There have been many methods to prevent this security vulnerability, but these methods are very complex or not easy to implement. The most commonly used biometric trait for verification and also the most spoofed biometric trait is fingerprint. The need is to find an easy way to detect a fake fingerprint. The proposed system uses fingerprint and the photo of the fingernail when light is passed through is taken. The image of the fingernail is processed and features are extracted using SIFT and compared with feature vector stored in the database. The correlation is then calculated. Based on the correlation the system decides whether the fingerprint is fake or not. The system was found to react positively to intensity changes in the fingernail image and difference in the pattern of the fingernail. This system provides a simple and robust method for detection of fingerprint spoofing. © 2016 The Authors.",Scopus,Procedia Computer Science

Since unimodal biometrics are subjected to various problems regarding recognition and security, multimodal biometrics have been used extensively nowadays for personal authentication. In this paper we have proposed an efficient personal identification system using two biometric identifiers, palm print and Inner knuckle print. In the recent years, palm prints and knuckle prints have overruled other biometric identifiers because of their unique, stable and novelty feature. The proposed feature extraction method for palm print is Monogenic Binary Coding (MBC), which is an efficient approach for extracting palm print features. Then for inner knuckle print recognition we have tried two algorithms named Ridgelet Transform and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). Also we have compared their results in terms of recognition rate. We then adopt Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifying the extracted feature vectors. Combining both knuckle print and palm print for personal identification will give better security and accuracy. © 2014 IEEE.",Scopus,"2014 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology, ICRTIT 2014"

Recently, multimodal biometric has attracted increasing focus among researchers as this overwhelms many limitations of unimodal biometric systems and hence more reliable. In this paper, we propose four different feature extraction techniques namely Principle Component Analysis Mixture Model (PCA MM), Singular Value Decomposition Mixture Model (SVD MM), Independent Component Analysis I Mixture Model (ICA I MM), and Independent Component Analysis II Mixture Model (ICA II MM) to design a multimodal biometric system at feature level. The proposed methods begin with modeling the multimodal biometrics data using Gaussian Mixture Model followed by a subspace methods like PCA, SVD, ICA I, and ICA II. Extensive experiments are carried out to observe the verification performance of the proposed methods at feature and match score level on large dataset of 150 users. We compare the results of the combined biometric with the results of individual biometric and also results of the proposed schemes against conventional (without mixture model) subspace approaches.

This paper presents a cyber security design approach that addresses cyber attacks that include modification of operator displays used for support in managing software controlled automated systems. This class of problems is especially important because our nation's critical infrastructures include such systems. In addition, many other systems, such as surveillance systems, navigation systems, and communications systems, are candidates for such solutions as they continue to become more and more automated. The suggested design approach builds upon fault-tolerant and automatic control system techniques that, with important and necessary modifications, are the basis for providing improved cyber security. In particular, the appropriate combination of diversely redundant security designs coupled with system dynamics models and state estimation techniques provide a potential means for detecting purposeful adjustments to operator displays. This paper provides a theoretical approach for designing such solutions and a corresponding set of examples with simulation-based results.

The semantic corresponding relations between DoDAF state transition description and HCPN occurrence graph are also explored, which is served as the basis of the model validation. © 2009 IEEE.",Scopus,ISCID 2009 - 2009 International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design

CBR extracts the information of voltage security from large sets of possible operating conditions of the power system, which are screened off-line by randomly varying the real and reactive loads at PQ buses. In a real time environment, a database may be created by keeping the record of operating states by state estimation. The severity of the contingency is assessed by the number of insecure operating states caused by that contingency, which is predicted by CBR. Security classes are defined by the threshold value of the maximum loadability margins (MLM), calculated using the continuation power flow (CPF) method. For insecure states, the presented technique also gives an optimal load shedding plan to bring the system into secure mode. © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.",Scopus,International Journal of Reliability and Safety

We present an efficient incremental checkpointing mechanism. It requires to record only the state changes and not the complete state. After the creation of a check-point, state changes are logged incrementally as records in memory, with which an application can spontaneously roll back later. This incrementalism allows us to implement checkpointing with high performance. Only small constant time is required for checkpoint creation and state recording. Rollback requires linear time in the number of recorded state changes, which is bounded by the number of state variables times the number of checkpoints. We implement a Java source transformer that automatically converts an existing application into a behavior-preserving one with checkpointing functionality. This transformation is application-independent and application-transparent. A wide range of applications can benefit from this technique. Currently, it has been used for distributed discrete event simulation using the Time Warp technique. © 2006 IEEE.",Scopus,Proceedings - Winter Simulation Conference

To support more secret keys associated with nodes, it is often expected that the tree has a sufficiently large depth. This places a burden on employing it implicitly or explicitly in real world. In this work, we show how to compress linear-size public key down to constant-size public key and give our construction featuring constant-size public key in the standard model. We prove that our construction achieves an improved security, adaptive security, under the matrix decision Diffie-Hellman assumption, which is a generalization of standard k-Lin assumption. Moreover, our key-generation, key-derivation and encryption algorithms have lower time complexity than that of the prior construction, leading to further efficiency improvements.

In this article, an Ethereum based blockchain network has been proposed that monitors and assures the safety of the VirtualMachine Images (VMI) stored at the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) end. The proposed scheme tends to design a dedicated Smart Contract which handles each and every function, starting from request of a VMI by the Cloud Service Consumer (CSC) to the usage of the same by the later. The use of blockchain technology ensures that no single admin/third party can control/modify the system.

To this end, defenders can launch a cyber-forensic investigation, which discovers the techniques that the threat actors used in the incident. A fundamental challenge in such an investigation is prioritizing the investigation of particular techniques since the investigation of each technique requires time and effort, but forensic analysts cannot know which ones were actually used before investigating them. To ensure prompt discovery, it is imperative to provide decision support that can help forensic analysts with this prioritization. A recent study demonstrated that data-driven decision support, based on a dataset of prior incidents, can provide state-of-the-art prioritization. However, this data-driven approach, called DISCLOSE, is based on a heuristic that utilizes only a subset of the available information and does not approximate optimal decisions. To improve upon this heuristic, we introduce a principled approach for data-driven decision support for cyber-forensic investigations. We formulate the decision-support problem using a Markov decision process, whose states represent the states of a forensic investigation. To solve the decision problem, we propose a Monte Carlo tree search based method, which relies on a k-NN regression over prior incidents to estimate state-transition probabilities. We evaluate our proposed approach on multiple versions of the MITRE ATT&CK dataset, which is a knowledge base of adversarial techniques and tactics based on real-world cyber incidents, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms DISCLOSE in terms of techniques discovered per effort spent.

The problem of hidden faults is considered from the perspective of a resource-based approach as a problem of growth from a lower level of replication to the next level of diversification in the development of models, methods and means. Computer systems in critical applications have risen to the level of diversification in the division of the operating mode into normal and emergency, in the input data and structurally functional checkability, which for digital components have become different in these modes. Digital components continue to be traditionally stamped based on matrix structures that reflect the level of replication. The lag of the components from the development of the system creates a problem of hidden faults which can be accumulated during the normal mode and reduce the fault tolerance of the components and the functional safety of the system in emergency mode. We propose a method of counteracting hidden faults by raising components to the level of diversification in the promising field of FPGA designing. The proposed method uses the natural version redundancy inherent in the program code of the FPGA projects with LUT-oriented architecture. The method generates and selects versions of the program code, reducing many hidden faults of short circuits between neighboring inputs of LUT units. Possible hidden faults are eliminated by increasing the checkability of the FPGA project in normal mode and the trustworthiness of the results calculated in emergency mode.

In terms of security, the formal specification and assessment of access control and policy enforcement models allows reasoning on their correctness. These formalization requirements become apparent in the context of an ESA realistic application scenario that involves the possible collision of two space objects in Earth orbit that are characterized by different sensitivity levels. To aid the decision toward safe collision avoidance actions, the secure and efficient sharing of sensitive information data between the operators of the two objects must be ensured. We present a novel approach and formal framework based on the algebraic theory of graph transformation to achieve this goal. We use the visual modeling language Henshin to formally specify the enforcement of policy rule-sets and computational semantics on the scenario's sensitive data before it is released from higher to lower security levels. We shall refer to this operation as ""information downgrading"". In parallel, special privacy and sharing constraints deriving from the scenario's context dictate the need of balancing data security with data usability during the downgrading process. Finally, the functional correctness of our formal framework is validated by detecting possible conflicts and inconsistencies between data computations application.",Scopus,"13th International Conference on Space Operations, SpaceOps 2014"

This has become more complex and in rail transportation fields and the methods to ensure its correctness have been slow in development. One feasible approach is to mathematically verify software design in such systems with Formal Methods. ATP (Automatic Train Protection) is a vital part of Train Control Systems. It assures safe train movement by a combination of train detection, separation of trains running on the same track or over interlocked routes, over speed prevention, and route interlocking. Obviously ATP is a safety-critical system and we regard it as a case study for our formal development methods. Firstly, the multi-tasks ATP onboard software model and state transitions will be modelled with UML; secondly, the timing model will be verified to meet the requirement of timing by SMV model checker; finally, the multi-tasking timing model will be realized with VxWorks (a real-time operating system by WindRiver).

As a consequence, once the violation is addressed, no clear path exists for reinstating the flagged client beyond having the network operator reset the controller or manually implement a state change via an external command.

However, testing TCP stacks is difficult. First, a TCP stack accepts packets and system calls that have dependencies between each other, and thus generating effective test cases is challenging. Second, a TCP stack has various complex state transitions, but existing testing approaches target covering states instead of covering state transitions, and thus their testing coverage is limited. Finally, our study of TCP stack commits shows that 87% of bug-fixing commits are related to semantic bugs (such as RFC violations), but existing bug sanitizers can detect only memory bugs not semantic bugs. In this paper, we design a novel fuzzing framework named TCP-Fuzz, to effectively test TCP stacks and detect bugs. TCP-Fuzz consists of three key techniques: (1) a dependency-based strategy that considers dependencies between packets and system calls, to generate effective test cases; (2) a transition-guided fuzzing approach that uses a new coverage metric named branch transition as program feedback, to improve the coverage of state transitions; (3) a differential checker that compares the outputs of multiple TCP stacks for the same inputs, to detect semantic bugs. We have evaluated TCP-Fuzz on five widely-used TCP stacks (TLDK, F-Stack, mTCP, FreeBSD TCP and Linux TCP), and find 56 real bugs (including 8 memory bugs and 48 semantic bugs). 40 of these bugs have been confirmed by related developers.",Web of Science,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2021 USENIX ANNUAL TECHNICAL CONFERENCE
