Recently data mining and state transition analysis are becoming important components in identifying intrusions. This paper proposes a semantic based intrusion detection scheme where state transition analysis, pattern matching and data mining techniques are integrated to maximize the detection accuracy. Patterns and rules are formulated based on the events detected by WSN. The sink receives information about the several events happening in the coverage area and correlates the streaming data (events) in spatial domain (several sensors) and time domain. The semantic rules are developed using ANTLR tool. The proposed scheme has been validated using a surveillance system for detecting an intruder. Implementations prove that the proposed hybrid intrusion detection scheme can accurately detect an intruder with the help of a wired network and an appropriate database.",IEEE Xplore,2011 International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)

Li,10.1109/TIFS.2018.2807793,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8295130,2018.0,IEEE Journals,"In currently popular access control models, the security policies and regulations never change in the running system process once they are identified, which makes it possible for attackers to find the vulnerabilities in a system, resulting in the lack of ability to perceive the system security status and risks in a dynamic manner and exposing the system to such risks. By introducing the maximum entropy (MaxENT) models into the rule optimization for the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model, this paper proposes an improved BLP model with the self-learning function: MaxENT-BLP. This model first formalizes the security properties, system states, transformational rules, and a constraint model based on the states transition of the MaxENT. After handling the historical system access logs as the original data sets, this model extracts the user requests, current states, and decisions to act as the feature vectors. Second, we use k -fold cross validation to divide all vectors into a training set and a testing set. In this paper, the model training process is based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. And this model contains a strategy update algorithm to adjust the access control rules dynamically according to the access and decision records in a system. Third, we prove that MaxENT-BLP is secure through theoretical analysis. By estimating the precision, recall, and F1-score, the experiments show the availability and accuracy of this model. Finally, this paper provides the process of model training based on deep learning and discussions regarding adversarial samples from the malware classifiers. We demonstrate that MaxENT-BLP is an appropriate choice and has the ability to help running information systems to avoid more risks and losses.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security

In order to be more suitable for embedded scenarios the proposed method uses short time Fourier transforms on streams of hardware performance counters. The frequency information is used to build an encoding to a state transition. These transitions are used to build a corresponding state machine which recognizes and authenticates the protected program continuously at run time.

In order to reduce the number of state transitions, the finite state machine tiles in a string matcher adopt bit-level input symbols. Long target patterns are divided into subpatterns with a fixed length; deterministic finite automata are built with the subpatterns. Using the pattern dividing, the variety of target pattern lengths can be mitigated, so that memory usage in homogeneous string matchers can be efficient. In order to identify each original long pattern being divided, a two-stage sequential matching scheme is proposed for the successive matches with subpatterns. Experimental results show that total memory requirements decrease on average by 47.8 percent and 62.8 percent for Snort and ClamAV rule sets, in comparison with several existing bit-split string matching methods.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems

Schneider; Lidong Zhou,10.1109/MSP.2005.125,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514398,2005.0,IEEE Magazines,"A thread of research has emerged to investigate the interactions of replication with threshold cryptography for use in environments that satisfy weak assumptions. The result is a new paradigm known as distributed trust; this article attempts to survey that landscape. ""Divide and conquer"" can be a powerful tool for disentangling complexity when designing a computing system. However, some aspects of system design are inseparable. Treating these as though they were independent leads to one interfering with the other, and ""divide and be conquered"" perhaps better characterizes the consequences. For some years, we have been investigating how to construct systems that continue functioning despite component failures and attacks. A question we have pondered is to what extent does divide and conquer apply? Somewhat less than you might hope is, unfortunately, the answer. One could argue that attacks can be seen as just another cause for component failure. The Byzantine fault model asserts that a faulty component can exhibit arbitrarily malicious (so-called ""Byzantine"") behavior; a system that tolerates Byzantine faults should then be able to handle anything. Moreover, because any component can be viewed abstractly in terms of its state and a set of possible next-state transitions - in short, a state machine - fault-tolerant services can be built by assembling enough state-machine copies so that outputs from the ones exhibiting Byzantine behavior are outvoted by the correctly functioning ones. The fault-tolerance of the ensemble thus exceeds the fault-tolerance of any individual state machine, and a distributed fault-tolerance is the result. A closer look at such replicated state machines, however, reveals problems ""when attacks are possible. Specific difficulties with the approach and how we can overcome these are described later in this article, but the overall vision remains compelling: place more trust in an ensemble than in any of its individual components. In analogy with distributed fault-tolerance, then, we are seeking ways to implement distributed trust.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Security & Privacy

While many intrusion detection systems (IDSes) have been adapted to monitor ICS, they cannot detect malicious network packets from a compromised PLC that con-form to the network protocol. A domain expert needs to manually construct IDS rules to model a PLC’s behavior. That approach is time-consuming and error-prone. Alternatively, machine learning can infer a PLC’s behavior model from network traces, but that model may be inaccurate due to a lack of high-quality training data. This paper presents CoToRu - a toolchain that takes in the PLC’s code to automatically generate a comprehensive set of IDS rules. CoToRu comprises (1) an analyzer that parses PLC code to build a state transition table for modeling the PLC’s behavior, and (2) a generator that instantiates IDS rules for detecting deviations in PLC behavior. The generated rules can be imported into Zeek IDS to detect various attacks. We apply CoToRu to a power grid testbed and show that our generated rules provide superior performance compared to existing IDSes, including those based on statistical analysis, invariant-checking, and machine learning. Our prototype with CoToRu’s generated rules provide sub-millisecond detection latency, even for complex PLC logic.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE INFOCOM 2022 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications

Dietrich,10.1109/ICYCS.2008.530,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4709304,2008.0,IEEE Conferences,"The security of well established secure channel technologies like transport layer security (TLS) or IP security (IPSec) can be significantly improved by emerging concepts like trusted computing. The use of trusted platform modules (TPMs) offers new methods for improving the security of these well established technologies. How secure channel technologies can be adapted to use trusted computing concepts is subject to current research. A major part of this research addresses the integration of the TCG's specified remote attestation. Remote attestation enables a platform to provide a trustworthy proof of its current configuration (i.e. software that has been loaded on the platform). Hence, based on this proof, a remote platform can decide whether to open a channel to another platform or not. In current approaches, the proof of the platform configuration is processed before a secure channel is established, which is not opened if the reported configuration is not accepted by the hosts. However, one important problem has not been solved yet. Currently, no satisfying solution how the change of a platform's configuration can be securely and reliably reported to the remote platform whilst a channel is open, exists. A reliable method to provide a proof for a configuration change can be implemented with only minor modifications of the TPM specification and the TLS protocol. Experimental results show that it is possible to implement this proof mechanism with only a few additional TPM commands.",IEEE Xplore,2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists

These resources communicate using complex on-chip interconnect networks that attempt to quickly and efficiently arbitrate memory transactions whose behaviors can vary drastically depending on the current mode of operation and system operating state. Security- and safety-critical applications require access control policies that define how these resources interact to ensure that malicious and unsafe behaviors do not occur. Aker is a design and verification framework for on-chip access control. The core of Aker is the access control wrapper (ACW)–a high-performance yet efficient hardware module that dynamically arbitrates on-chip communications. Aker distributes ACWs across the SoC and programs them to perform local access control. Aker provides a firmware generation tool and a property-driven security verification methodology to ensure that the ACWs are properly integrated and configured. Aker security verification confirms that the ACW behaves properly at IP level. It verifies the hardware root of trust firmware configures the ACW correctly. And it evaluates system-level security threats due to interactions between shared resources. Aker is experimentally validated on a Xilinx UltraScale+ programmable SoC.

We also develop a controlling policy for each content provider to map its status to the most suitable operating mode to diminish power consumption. Moreover, we propose a smart Selective Caching Scheme (SCS) so that the caching portion in a CR's cache memory is adjusted according to content popularity and available spaces of two customized content cache spaces, namely hot and cold caching queues, for storing popular and unpopular content objects. This scheme can further decrease the power from caching since it is diminished when the traffic load is reduced via the proposed CRs' adaptive mechanism. The evaluation results with practical insights in several distinct scenarios show that the proposal can provide considerably higher energy efficiency and network performance at the same time, typically achieving at least 20% power-saving with a higher hop reduction ratio, compared to existing Internet designs with relevant state-of-the-art caching strategies.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering

The model has been evaluated over various huge publicly available biometric databases. To the best of our knowledge this is the first unified architecture proposed, segmenting multiple biometric traits. It has been tested over around 5000 * 5 = 25, 000 images (5000 images per trait) and produces very good results. Our work on unified biometric segmentation, opens up the vast opportunities in the field of multiple biometric traits based authentication systems.",IEEE Xplore,2017 4th IAPR Asian Conference on Pattern Recognition (ACPR)

Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is one of the most interesting subjects in this area. The Re-ID system is divided into two main stages: i) extracting feature representations to construct a person's appearance signature and ii) establishing the correspondence/matching by learning similarity metrics or ranking functions. However, appearance based person Re-Idis a challenging task due to similarity of human's appearance and visual ambiguities across different cameras. This paper provides a representation of the appearance descriptors, called signatures, for multi-shot Re-ID First, we will present the tracklets, i.e trajectories of persons. Then, we compute the signature and represent it based on the approach of Part Appearance Mixture (PAM). An evaluation of the quality of this signature representation is also described in order to essentially solve the problems of high variance in a person's appearance, occlusions, illumination changes and person's orientation/pose. To deal with variance in a person's appearance, we represent it as a set of multi-modal feature distributions modeled by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).

Every system call includes a processor mode switch from the unprivileged user mode to the privileged kernel mode. Although processor mode switches are the essential isolation mechanism to guarantee the system's integrity, they induce direct and indirect performance costs as they invalidate parts of the processor state. In recent years, high-performance networks and storage hardware has made the user/kernel transition overhead the bottleneck for IO-heavy applications. To make matters worse, security vulnerabilities in modern processors (e.g., Meltdown) have prompted kernel mitigations that further increase the transition overhead. To decouple system calls from user/kernel transitions we propose AnyCall, which uses an in-kernel compiler to execute safety-checked user bytecode in kernel mode. This allows for very fast system calls interleaved with error checking and processing logic using only a single user/kernel transition. We have implemented AnyCall based on the Linux kernel's extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) subsystem. Our evaluation demonstrates that system call bursts are up to 55 times faster using AnyCall and that real-world applications can be sped up by 24 % even if only a minimal part of their code is run by AnyCall.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 11th Workshop on Programming Languages and Operating Systems

Takens' theorem in nonlinear dynamics allows reconstruction of topologically invariant, time-delay-embedding states from the computer dynamics in a sufficiently high-dimensional space. The resultant dynamical states are vertices, and the state-to-state transitions are edges in a graph.

Providing a holistic security assessment for networks consisting of several hundreds hosts is hardly feasible though without some sort of mechanization. Mitigation, prioritizing counter-measures subject to a given budget, currently lacks a solid theoretical understanding and is hence more art than science. In this work, we propose the first approach for conducting comprehensive what-if analyses in order to reason about mitigation in a conceptually well-founded manner. To evaluate and compare mitigation strategies, we use simulated penetration testing, i.e., automated attack-finding, based on a network model to which a subset of a given set of mitigation actions, e.g., changes to the network topology, system updates, configuration changes etc. is applied. Using Stackelberg planning, we determine optimal combinations that minimize the maximal attacker success (similar to a Stackelberg game), and thus provide a well-founded basis for a holistic mitigation strategy. We show that these Stackelberg planning models can largely be derived from network scan, public vulnerability databases and manual inspection with various degrees of automation and detail, and we simulate mitigation analysis on networks of different size and vulnerability.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 34th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing

Specifically, we use Rayleigh and Watson tests. While our results are mainly exploratory, we are able to demonstrate that the attacks are not uniformly distributed, nor do they follow a Poisson distribution as reported in other research. Our objective in this is to identify a distribution that can be used to establish risk metrics.Moreover, our approach provides a visual overview of the time patterns' variation, indicating when attacks are most likely. This will assist decision makers in cyber security to allocate resources or estimate the cost of system monitoring during high risk periods.Our results also reveal that the time patterns are influenced by the total number of attacks.

Assessing IoT systems' security and developing mitigation measures to prevent the spread of IoT malware is therefore critical. Furthermore, for training and testing the fidelity of cyber security-based Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches, the collection and exploration of information from multiple sources from the IoT are crucial. In this regard, we propose a multitask DL model for detecting IoT malware. Our proposed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based model efficiently performs two tasks: 1) determination of whether the provided traffic is benign or malicious, and 2) determination of the malware type for identifying malicious network traffic. We used large-scale traffic data of 145. pcap files of benign and malicious traffic collected from 18 different IoT devices. We performed a time-series analysis on the packets of traffic flows, which were then used to train the proposed model. The features extracted from the dataset were categorized into three modalities: flow-related, traffic flag-related, and packet payload-related features. A feature selection approach was employed at the feature and modality levels, and the best modalities and features were utilized for performance enhancement. For tasks 1 and 2 and multitask classification, the flow-related and flag-related modalities showed the best testing accuracies of 92.63%, 88.45%, and 95.83%, respectively.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management

Energy storage systems (ESSs), which have the ability to store and transfer energy temporarily, can be used as effective measures to enhance the capacity of consuming PVs and reduce carbon emissions in DNs. However, existing low-carbon dispatch strategies for multiple sources, storages and loads fail to consider voltage violations, while the temporal carbon emission intensity of the upper-level power grid is also often overlooked, which is an important factor that affects the dispatch strategy. Therefore, a two-stage self-adaptive dispatch strategy of ESSs that considers the temporal characteristics of slack nodal carbon emission intensity to minimise carbon emissions while maintaining voltage stability in DNs with high access to PVs is proposed. First, the framework of the proposed two-stage self-adaptive dispatch strategy of ESSs is established by taking into account the effects of ESSs on adjusting voltages and reducing carbon emissions, respectively, with the two-stage switch principle of two operation modes being determined. On this basis, an optimization dispatch model is established to improve voltages and carbon emissions, and the optimal day-ahead dispatch strategy of ESSs can be obtained by solving the model using genetic algorithm. Case studies of the modified 10 kV IEEE 33-node DN and IEEE 123-node DN verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed two-stage self-adaptive security and low-carbon day-ahead dispatch strategy for ESSs, showing that the voltage stabilisation and lower carbon emissions of DNs are both improved. © 2023 The Authors.

Several deep learning models have been proposed for visible-infrared (V-I) person ReID to recognize individuals from images captured using RGB and IR cameras. However, performance may decline considerably if RGB and IR images captured at test time are corrupted (e.g., noise, blur, and weather conditions). Although various data augmentation (DA) methods have been explored to improve the generalization capacity, these are not adapted for V-I person ReID. In this paper, a specialized DA strategy is proposed to address this multimodal setting. Given both the V and I modalities, this strategy allows to diminish the impact of corruption on the accuracy of deep person ReID models. Corruption may be modality-specific, and an additional modality often provides complementary information. Our multimodal DA strategy is designed specifically to encourage modality collaboration and reinforce generalization capability. For instance, punctual masking of modalities forces the model to select the informative modality. Local DA is also explored for advanced selection of features within and among modalities. The impact of training baseline fusion models for V-I person ReID using the proposed multimodal DA strategy is assessed on corrupted versions of the SYSUMM01, RegDB, and ThermalWORLD datasets in terms of complexity and efficiency. Results indicate that using our strategy provides V-I ReID models the ability to exploit both shared and individual modality knowledge so they can out-perform models trained with no or unimodal DA.

On the other side, memory-based system access authentication is becoming outdated and less preferred for live applications, especially where data security and customer privacy are crucial. Multi-modal authentication has outperformed the unimodal process with high accuracy and improved security in the user authentication field. Multi-modal biometric verification includes user attributes such as keystrokes, iris, speech, face, etc. For real-time execution of multi-modal biometric fusion-based live tracking for compatible applications. The study proposes an efficient continuous biometric user authentication system for a new challenge of pandemic time, a live online authentication of the evaluation process (CBUA-OE). The proposed CBUA-OE system can address the challenges associated with live proctoring and is also compatible with real-time implementation, deployment of authentication systems. The modified wolf optimization algorithm and CUBA-OE's optimal feature fusion algorithm give an edge over the other contemporary methods and make it more robust. In modern forms of authentication, the classification stage affects the overall outcome of the system, and the model's performance is also a factor of varying quality of datasets.

Vehicles connected to cITS form vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) to exchange messages. Like other networks and systems, cITSs are targeted by attackers intent on compromising and disrupting system integrity and availability. They can repeatedly spoof false information causing bottlenecks, traffic jams and even road accidents. The existing security infrastructure assumes that the network topology and/or attack behavior is static. However, the cITS is inherently dynamic in nature. Moreover, attackers may have the ability and resources to change their behavior continuously. Assuming a static IDS security model for VANETs is not suitable and can lead to low detection accuracy and high false alarms. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptive security solution based on deep learning and contextual references that can cope with the dynamic nature of the cITS topologies and increasingly common attack behaviors. In this study, deep belief networks (DBN) modeling was used to train the detection model. Binary cross entropy was used as a loss function to measure the prediction error. Two activation functions were used, Relu and Softmax, for input–output mapping. The Relu was used in the hidden layers, while the Sigmoid was used in the last layer to map the real vector to output between 0 and 1. The adaptation mechanism was incorporated into the detection model using a moving average that monitors predicted values within a time window. In this way, the model can readjust the classification thresholds on-the-fly as appropriate. The proposed model was evaluated using the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset, which is commonly used in such related works. The result is improved accuracy, demonstrating that the adaptation mechanism used in this study was effective. © 2022 by the authors.",Scopus,Algorithms

Users usually have multiple online identities (IDs) in different online services. In order to fuse the separated user data in multiple services for better business intelligence, it is critical for service providers to link online IDs belonging to the same user. On the other hand, the popularity of mobile networks and GPS-equipped smart devices have provided a generic way to link IDs, i.e., utilizing the mobility traces of IDs. However, linking IDs based on their mobility traces has been a challenging problem due to the highly heterogeneous, incomplete and noisy mobility data across services. In this paper, we propose DPLink, an end-to-end deep learning based framework, to complete the user identity linkage task for heterogeneous mobility data collected from different services with different properties. DPLink is made up by a feature extractor including a location encoder and a trajectory encoder to extract representative features from trajectory and a comparator to compare and decide whether to link two trajectories as the same user. Particularly, we propose a pre-training strategy with a simple task to train the DPLink model to overcome the training difficulties introduced by the highly heterogeneous nature of different source mobility data. Besides, we introduce a multi-modal embedding network and a co-attention mechanism in DPLink to deal with the low-quality problem of mobility data. By conducting extensive experiments on two real-life ground-truth mobility datasets with eight baselines, we demonstrate that DPLink outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions by more than 15 percent in terms of hit-precision. Moreover, it is expandable to add external geographical context data and works stably with heterogeneous noisy mobility traces. © 1989-2012 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering

Health policy should use a vast variety of analytical knowledge to collect data and measurements of difficulty. It should be beneficial and able to predict patient well-being by evaluating diet, medical history, and social behavior. Hours is a broad health network. Good lifestyle-recommendations are included. Therefore, informal health networks have become critical collective decision-making structures. Maintaining efficient knowledge distribution, performance, security, and secrecy is a crucial goal. The Health Advisory Framework (HRS) is of great value in achieving results such as the analysis of clinical effects, preventive advantages, therapeutic options, and complementary medications focused on patient knowledge databases, and people are utilizing social networks to uncover their health issues. Present research in this chapter on massive amounts of medical data decreases healthcare expenditures by integrating multimodal data from different outlets. Big data analysis utilizing the Advice Platform plays an essential part, offering a smart HRS strategy that provides visibility into how large data analytics can be used as effective health advising engine and how the healthcare system can be transformed from a traditional to a more personalized model into a tele-health setting. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Scopus,EAI/Springer Innovations in Communication and Computing

The top-down Universal Modeling Language (UML) service orientation enabled a unified co-design of both human and machine communications. Furthermore, the present concept includes an integrated subscription mechanism for people and devices, in a multi-tier user structure and a central-local distributed processing (Cloud-Edge). There are presented the end-user perspective, selection and involvement (in pilot prototyping of the SAVE demonstrator), considering cognitive age-related issues, oriented on usability and on the functional specifications of interfacing via web-apps (independent of the mobile platforms operating system). Location Based Services (LBS) manage data from the Geographical Information Systems (GIS) in a unified modern way, based on LISP – Location - (from) Identity Separation Protocol. These services of “orientation” – localization, real-time tracking – are integrated with another aspect of “restoring the referential” (both personal and communitarian): (re-) planning service, improving alert information in case of emergency, bilateral push-pull of security notifications. Restoring the end-users well-being takes benefit of eHealth and actigraphy services.

Due to its faster execution speed, skeleton-based automated SHAR systems are widely adopted in real-time applications such as surveillance systems, behavior analysis, gesture recognition, and security systems. To build such an efficient system, the recognition model needs to be trained on a large-scale multi-modal dataset to accurately identify multi-class actions. However, the recognition of multi-class actions with higher accuracy requires the extraction of the spatio-temporal discriminative features, which is a challenging task. Moreover, the traditional handcrafted feature-based Machine Learning (ML) models when dealing with a large dataset, fail to preserve spatio-temporal correlations, resulting in poor recognition accuracy. While exploring the recent literature, a paradigm shift in SHAR research from traditional ML-based models to deep learning models is observed, which intrigues us to hypothesize that deep learning is the future avenue for SHAR research on large datasets. To establish it, we perform an exhaustive study on the recent works published in 2017 onwards that utilize deep learning models in SHAR on large skeletal datasets, notably alleviating the tedious task of feature engineering and extraction. The comparative performance analysis of the recent models shows that the successor models outperform its predecessors in terms of recognition accuracy, confirming the prospects of the deep learning-based SHAR research on large skeletal datasets. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Scopus,Intelligent Systems Reference Library

For instance, Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies offer low data rate communication over long distance, whereas Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) technologies can reach higher data rates, but with a reduced range. For simple IoT applications, communication requirements can be fulfilled by a single technology. However, the requirements of more demanding IoT use cases can vary over time and with the type of data being exchanged. This is pushing the design towards multimodal approaches, where different wireless IoT technologies are combined and the most appropriate one is used as per the need. This paper considers the combination of Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as communication options for an IoT device that is running a Lightweight Machine to Machine/Constrained Application Protocol (LwM2M/CoAP) protocol stack. It analyses the challenges incurred by different protocol stack options, such as different transfer modes (IP versus non-IP), the use of Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) techniques, and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) security modes, and discusses the impact of handover between both communication technologies. A suitable end-to-end architecture for the targeted multimodal communication is presented. Using a prototype implementation of this architecture, an in-depth assessment of handover and its resulting latency is performed. © 2020 by the authors.

Information protection requires use of necessary physical, personal, information and communication technologies and above all - electromagnetic and cryptographic security measures. Equipment and tools for cryptographic protection should be examined and assessed in terms of resistance to known threats. Additional requirements are put on information protection for radio communication, especially military, where radio transmission is characterized by uncertainty of establishing and maintaining connections, bit rates are relatively low, often without full duplex. All this has an impact on the methods of cryptographic synchronization and implementation of cryptographic functions. A different approach to information protection is required by classic narrowband radio communications, a different one in time-division multi-access modes, and another one in broadband packet data transmission. Systems designed for information protection in radio communications implement appropriate operating modes of operation for cryptographic algorithms and protocols. Latest threats from quantum computers pose new challenges, especially in systems using public-key cryptography, because there are algorithms that can be used to attack these schemes with polynomial complexity. © The Author(s).

Most existing methods typically use appearance features and they seldom consider underlying interaction information. In this work, a technology of novel group activity recognition is proposed based on multi-modal relation representation with temporal-spatial attention. First, we introduce an object relation module, which processes all objects in a scene simultaneously through an interaction between their appearance feature and geometry, thus allowing the modeling of their relations. Second, to extract effective motion features, an optical flow network is fine-tuned by using the action loss as the supervised signal. Then, we propose two types of inference models, opt-GRU and relation-GRU, which are used to encode the object relationship and motion representation effectively, and form the discriminative frame-level feature representation. Finally, an attention-based temporal aggregation layer is proposed to integrate frame-level features with different weights and form effective video-level representations. We have performed extensive experiments on two popular datasets, and both have achieved state-of-the-art performance. The datasets are the Volleyball dataset and the Collective Activity dataset, respectively. © 2013 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Access

To overcome these, multimodal biometric systems are increasingly adopted. Multimodal biometric systems fuse information from multiple biometric traits. Rank level fusion is one of the approaches of information fusion for multimodal biometrics. In this paper, rank level fusion is considered as an optimization problem. Its aim is to minimize the distances between an aggregated rank list and each input rank list from individual biometric trait. A solution of this optimization problem has been proposed using cross-entropy (CE) Monte Carlo method. The proposed CE method uses two distance measures - namely, Spearman footrule and Kendall’s tau distances.

Icebreakers are the most influential vessel in assisting marine operations in Polar Regions. The present study is set to analyze the clearance area of level ice using Azimuthing propeller jet in bollard condition, by means of full-scale and model scale experiments. Moreover channel widening and heeling test is performed to analyze the escorting ability of an icebreaker with only using propeller jets. Scope of the current investigation can be incorporated in designing new icebreakers and maintaining desired channel width based on propeller jets effect. Propeller jets can be used to break level ice, when the ship is stationary or moving, where the amount and capacity of breaking or clearing the ice are based on the thrust of the propeller, angle between the propeller jet axis and free surface, and thickness of the ice as well as propeller running time. This paper presents a comparison between full-scale experiments data (carry out in the Gulf of Bothnia, March 2017) and model scale trials performed in Aker Arctic testing facility on the level ice sheet. These experiments were based on image data from external camera and propeller flow parameters, where the area, as well as coordinate calculation, were within 3% of the accuracy from the acquired images. Full-scale ice thicknesses utilized in the experiments were selected and confirmed from surveillance videos. Model-scale images were corrected using Hugin software while ImageJ was used to calculate ice clearance parameters. Propeller thrust and area analysis show 10-22 % of the variation in the results of the model and fullscale experiments for 16 mm thick model ice. 16 mm thick model ice results are much closer to full-scale trials than 25 mm thick model ice. Test results at 30° and 90° pod angles could be extrapolated to design a prototype vessel. Channel widening shows worthy outcome, with the use of Azipods at a speed of 8 kn channel width of 36 m can be attain by positioning the stern Azipods at 30° puller configuration. Changing the pod inclination by 30% will increase the channel width to 20%. In the widening of new level ice channel, 30° pod angle is the most suitable.

Basic background modeling techniques run quickly, but their accuracy is not sufficient for computer vision problems involving dynamic background. In contrast, adaptive background modeling techniques are more robust, but run more slowly. Due to its high inherent fine-grain parallelism, robust adaptive background modeling has been implemented on GPUs with significant performance improvements over CPUs. However, these implementations are infeasible in embedded applications due to the high power ratings of the targeted general-purpose GPU platforms. This paper focuses on exploiting fine-grain data parallelism and optimizing memory access patterns to target a low-cost adaptive background modeling algorithm multimodal mean (MMM) to a low-power GPU with thermal design power (TDP) of only 12 watts. The algorithm has comparable accuracy with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) algorithm, but less computational and memory cost. It achieves a frame rate of 392 fps with a full VGA resolution (640x480) frame on the low-power integrated GPU NVIDIA ION. This is a 20x speed-up of the MMM algorithm compared to the embedded CPU platform Intel Atom of comparable TDP.

Such search systems are called searchable symmetric encryption (SSE). The main part of SSE is an encrypted index which affects security and efficiency. Until now many SSE schemes have been proposed, but most of them uses a random oracle to achieve both adaptive security and an optimal index size. The index size of adaptively secure SSE schemes without a random oracle can be much larger. In this paper, we propose a new SSE scheme which satisfies adaptive security in the standard model and has an optimal index size. Furthermore the index of our scheme consists of Bloom filters and simple arrays, that is, arrays of integers. Since Bloom filters are also implemented by an array of integers, the structure of the index is simple. Thus, unlike other SSE schemes with an optimal index size, the size does not depend on a security parameter. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)

Directed to the problem of the improper defensive strategy selection caused by inaccurately characterizing the attack and defense game in MTD, optimal strategy selection for MTD based on Markov game (MG) is proposed to balance the hopping defensive revenue and network service quality. On the one hand, traditional matrix game structure often fails to describe MTD confrontation accurately. To deal with this inaccuracy, MTD based on MG is constructed. Markov decision process is used to characterize the transition among network multi-states. Dynamic game is used to characterize the multi-phases of attack and defense in MTD circumstances. Besides, it converts all the attack and defense actions into the changes in attack surface or the ones in exploration surface, thus improving the universality of the proposed model. On the other hand, traditional models care little about defense cost in the process of optimal strategy selection. After comprehensively analyzing the impact of defense cost and defense benefit on the strategy selection, an optimal strategy selection algorithm is designed to prevent the deviation of the selected strategies from actual network conditions, thus ensuring the correctness of optimal strategy selection. Finally, the simulation and the deduction of the proposed approach are given in case study so as to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy optimal selection approach. © 2013 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Access

The proposed solution space consists of extracting appropriate features that represent the dynamics of targets in surveillance environments using their motion trajectories combined with a finite state automaton model for analyzing state changes of such features to detect and localize event(s)-of-interest. We introduce the cumulative moving average (CMA) and the preceding segment average (PSA) statistical metric as features that indicate gradual and sudden changes in the instantaneous velocity of moving targets. In order to support both on-line and off-line summarization, a finite state machine, that is often referred to as Mealy Machine, has been proposed to model the trajectory of a moving target and used for detecting transitions that represents a change from one state to another when initiated by a triggering event or condition. We conduct several systematic experiments on different scenario-specific in-house videos and other publicly available datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and benchmark its performance against chosen baseline strategies. The results of our experiments highlight the superiority of our proposed method in accurately localizing the start and end of event(s)-of-interest in videos within the chosen dataset. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Scopus,Multimedia Tools and Applications

In this method, each state should be known to the sink, in order to predict accurately. Also, in some cases, if the residual energy estimation is not based on the operational states of a sensor node, it may not reflect the exact amount of energy consumed by each node. In order to overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose to design an intrusion detection system to detect and mitigate the attacks using energy monitoring technique. In this technique, the malicious attacks are detected by monitoring the node's energy. The monitoring nodes predicts the energy using hidden Markov model (HMM) and compares it with the actual energy detected through an energy query technique. The detected attacks are classified based on the energy threshold levels. The attacks are then mitigated by establishing the attack-free route between source and destination, respectively. By simulation results, we show that the proposed technique increases the efficiency, reduces overhead and energy consumption. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Scopus,International Journal of Mobile Network Design and Innovation

At present, electronic or optical sensors like cameras and scanning devices are used to capture images, recordings or measurements of a person's 'unique' characteristics. These technologies are being utilized across a range of applications like security, prevention of cyber crime and border control, public aid/social benefits, customs, immigration, passport and healthcare identity verification, as well as commercial enterprises use. Most biometric systems that are typically use a single biometric trait to establish identity have some challenges like Noise in sensed data which increases False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of the system, Non-universality which reduces Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR). Hence the security afforded by the biometric system mitigates its benefits. In this paper, we propose a Fused Multimodal systems which also have several advantages over unibiometric systems such as, enhanced verification accuracy, larger feature space to accommodate more subjects and higher security against spoofing.

Also, biometrics is increasingly used in many parts of our lives, from biometric passport, airport authentication and control access. It is easier and safer to login to internet banking with something you have or are (fingerprint, face, iris etc.) than with something you remember (and that can be stolen by malicious software or people). Also, signing an order will be more secure by using a fingerprint than a code generated by a token. A combination of these two authentication methods will lead to a visible security enhancement, too. The fingerprint can be used for two purposes: to open a token device and/or login to the internet banking application or sign an order.

While this may be beneficial from the performance and energy perspective, it certainly exhibits new challenges in terms of security due to increased data transmission over networks with potentially unknown threats. Among possible security issues are timing attacks which are not prevented by traditional cryptographic security. Metrics on which offloading decisions are based must include security aspects in addition to performance and energy-efficiency. This paper aims at quantifying the security attributes and their impact on the performance of mobile offloading systems. The offloading system is modeled as a hybrid CTMC and queueing model. The proposed model focuses on state transition and state-based control. The quantification analysis is carried out for steady-state behavior of the CTMC model as to optimize the weighted-sum cost measure. By transforming the security model to a model with absorbing state, we compute the “mean time to security failure” (MTTSF) measure. Finally, a security and performance tradeoff measure is computed based on the system model and optimum parameter set is found for the system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)

Our reduction has polynomial loss to the underlying primitives. We develop a “punctured programming” approach to constructing and proving systems where outside of obfuscation we rely only on primitives realizable from pseudo random generators. Our work consists of two constructions. Our first FE construction is provably secure against any attacker that is limited to making all of its private key queries after it sees the challenge ciphertext. (This notion implies selective security.) Our construction makes use of an we introduce called puncturable deterministic encryption (PDE) which may be of independent interest. With this primitive in place we show a simple FE construction. We then provide a second construction that achieves adaptive security from indistinguishability obfuscation. Our central idea is to achieve an adaptively secure functional encryption by bootstrapping from a one bounded FE scheme that is adaptively secure. By using bootstrapping we can use “selective-ish” techniques at the outer level obfuscation level and push down the challenge of dealing with adaptive security to the one bounded FE scheme, where it has been already been solved. We combine our bootstrapping framework with a new “key signaling” technique to achieve our construction and proof. Altogether, we achieve the first construction and proof for adaptive security for functional encryption. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2015.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)

Past studies, in particular those in support of the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI), have shown nuclear thermal propulsion systems provide superior performance for high mass high propulsive delta-V missions. The recent NASA Design Reference Architecture (DRA) 5.0 Study re-examined mission, payload, and transportation system requirements for a human Mars landing mission in the post-2030 timeframe. Nuclear thermal propulsion was again identified as the preferred in-space transportation system. An extensive nuclear thermal rocket technology development effort was conducted from 1955-1973 under the Rover/NERVA Program. Both graphite and refractory metal alloy fuel types were pursued. Recent activities have included parallel evaluation and design efforts of engine concepts based on both fuel types. Isotopic inventory changes in a propulsion reactor can influence multiple aspects of engine operation. Two primary areas of concern are changes in engine reactivity and in the radiation environments external to the engine. The magnitudes of the impacts vary depending on the reactor type (fast neutron spectrum or thermal/epithermal neutron spectrum), engine operating times, cooling times since last engine operation, and engine design and operating mode. Engines can provide direct nuclear thermal propulsion only or provide some combination of direct propulsion and electrical power generation. Operating times are usually short for engines employed solely for direct nuclear thermal propulsion. Reactivity losses are usually low and are due to a combination of fissile depletion and fission product absorption. These small reactivity losses due to depletion can be accommodated by control drum rotation, but drum rotation also results in core power distribution changes that can lower engine performance. Engines providing electrical power generation will operate for longer periods and reactivity losses due to fissile depletion and fission product absorption will be higher. Engine systems employing fast spectrum reactors show lower sensitivity to fission product buildup than those employing thermal neutron spectrum reactors. Regardless of engine type or operating mode, fission product and heavy metal isotopes are the primary neutron and gamma sources and establish the radiation environment and biological dose rates near the engine. This paper addresses isotopic changes in a representative thermal neutron spectrum engine. Fission product and heavy metal isotopes important to neutron absorption are identified and ranked at selected times during engine operation. Fission product and heavy metal isotopes important to dose contributions around the engine are identified and ranked at selected times during and after operation. © 2014 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.",Scopus,50th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference 2014

The occurrence of damage mode depends on the ratios of energy release rates. Simultaneous generation of damage modes such as multiple fiber breakage called as fiber fragmentation influences the characteristics of propagating elastic waves which are used for detecting, locating and understanding damage modes for acoustic emission method. Understanding the wave characteristics via experimental methods is difficult as the control of damage mode sequence is a challenge. In this paper, wave propagations due to single or multiple fiber breakages positioned at various locations along the laminate and through thickness in different composite lay-ups are studied using dynamic finite element models. Fiber breakage is defined as a point load with the rise time of 1 μsec. The load amplitude is identified using stress-strain curve of carbon fiber. The amplitude of matrix cracking is defined as crack opening displacement as a boundary load to the finite element model. The positions and amplitudes of damage modes are varied to understand the characteristics of waveform signatures. Each lamina is defined as a different plate and orthotropic material properties are entered as input to the model. The paper shows that multi-mode simultaneous damage in composites causes complex waveform generation, which makes pattern recognition based on amplitude and frequency real time a challenging task. © 2013 SPIE.",Scopus,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering

Many such mechanisms have been developed and used in practical applications. Most of the currently favored mechanisms, such as semaphores and monitors are based on the concept of mutual exclusion. In this paper, we describe an alternative synchronization mechanism that is not based on the concept of mutual exclusion, but rather on observing the sequencing of significant events in the course of an asynchronous computation. Two kinds of objects are described, an eventcount, which is a communication path for signalling and observing the progress of concurrent computations, and a sequencer, which assigns an order to events occurring in the system. Eventcounts and sequencers are a more natural mechanism for controlling the sequence of execution of processes that do not need mutual exclusion. Examples of these applications are monitoring state changes of operating system variables, and broadcasting the occurrence of an event to any number of interested processes. In applications where mutual exclusion mechanisms are explicitly prohibited, such as physically distributed systems and systems that need to solve the confinement problem, eventcounts and sequencers can be used to solve synchronization problems in a very natural way. An eventcount is an object that keeps a count of the number of events in a particular class that have occurred so far in the execution of the system. An eventcount can be thought of as a non-decreasing integer variable. We define an advance primitive to signal the occurrence of an event associated with a particular eventcount and two primitives, await and read, that obtain the ""value"" of an eventcount. Some synchronization problems require arbitration: a decision based on which of several events happens first. Eventcounts alone do not have this ability to discriminate between two events that happen. Consequently, we provide another kind of non-decreasing integer object, called a sequencer, that can be used to dynamically order the events in a given class. Eventcounts and sequencers are a primitive synchronization mechanism of approximately the same level of abstraction as semaphores. We show in the paper how P and V semaphore operations can be expressed in terms of eventcount operations, and how a simultaneous-P operation on several semaphores is just as easily expressed. On the other hand, eventcounts are more easily used in expressing synchronization requirements directly in the program because they directly encode the history of events in the system. We show in the paper how the eventcount and sequencer primitives can be axiomatized in terms of a partial ordering of the events that occur within the system. From the axioms defining eventcounts and sequencers, one can directly obtain the ordering constraints enforced in a particular set of programs. Synchronization mechanisms provided by operating systems present a thorny obstacle to solving the ""confinement problem"" defined by Lampson. Eventcounts and sequencers provide some help in controlling the flow of information, by providing a distinction between those synchronization primitives that can be used to send information (advance and ticket) and those that can only receive (read and await). In the paper we show how to solve a synchronization problem called the ""secure readers-writers problem"" while preventing unnecessary leaks of information.",Scopus,"Proceedings of the 6th ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, SOSP 1977"

We propose a state transition model, based on the continuous time Markov chain (CTMC), to study the behaviors of the sensors in a WSN under internal attack. Then we conduct the internal attack detection model as the epidemiological model. In this model, we explore the detection rate as the rate of a compromised state transition to a response state. By using the Bellman equation, the utility for the state transitions of a sensor can be written in standard forms of dynamic programming. It reveals a natural way to find the optimal detection rate that is by maximizing the total utility of the compromised state of the node (the sum of current utility and future utility). In particular, we encapsulate the current state, survivability, availability, and energy consumption of the WSN into an information set.

Becker,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172983,2023.0,VDE Conferences,"Future energy systems rely mostly on supplydependent resources like wind and solar energy. Since most of the produced energy from distributed renewable sources arises as electricity, electrification of energy consumers and producers, called prosumers, expands. In this context, multimodal distribution grids make use of the storage capabilities of other energy sectors like heat, and abolish the supply-dependency and uncertainty of the feed-in of decentralized generators. This provides flexibility in the energy system, which increases security of supply and at the same time ensures economical energy provision. The subject of this paper is to exploit the flexibility of such a multi-modal energy system for operation in an optimal way. The cellular approach serves here as the energy system architecture. Aim is to provide flexibility with a cell by optimally distributing a flexibility request to subordinate prosumers changing their active and reactive power. The load change is hereby to be optimally dispatched to the different components of the prosumers under consideration of technical restrictions and dynamic behavior of components, the grids and economical aspects. For dynamic modelling and simulation the open-source modelling language Modelica is used. Using a lowvoltage benchmark model expanded by multi-modal technologies, the proposed methodology shows that the cells are capable of providing flexibility to the overlying grid with high accuracy at low costs.",IEEE Xplore,ETG Congress 2023

Kernel memory and additional hardware state changes are constantly monitored and aggregated into a combined guest OS state, which is reported to a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), thus providing a trusted integrity measurement in runtime. This measurement can then be used for data protection (sealing of secret keys) and remote attestation based on the runtime integrity of the guest OS. © J.UCS.",Scopus,Journal of Universal Computer Science

In order to use it, a background model must be built and updated according to light and scenario changes. We discuss in this paper a new algorithm (BAC) which creates or restores a background model based on the behaviour of pixels in successive frames, while performs a segmentation of objects in the scene yielding a confidence value for the obtained background, a problem which is addressed by few methods in the literature. This allows us to fulfil the requirement of producing a model, for instance in scenarios like airport halls, without interfering normal operation and still segment scenes. © 2008 IEEE.",Scopus,Proceedings - International Conference on Pattern Recognition

This work has been performed within the European ACTS-M2VTS project (Multi-Modal Verification for Teleservices and Security Applications) which is concerned with person authentication using multiple modalities. The system achieved good performance on the M2VTS and XM2VTS databases whereas the performance decreased on the LoCoMic database which is more representative of real conditions. In fact, we have shown that in text independent mode, the performance differs significantly according to the test item considered (digits, name, and sentence…). This shows that, even in text independent mode, the access control system should propose a structure for the uttered sentence. © 1999 6th European Conference on Speech Communication and Technology, EUROSPEECH 1999.

Based on the hypothesis that unusual conducts like system exploitation will trigger an abnormal network pattern, we try to detect this anomalous network traffic pattern as a sign of malicious, or at least suspicious activities. Capturing and analyzing of a network traffic pattern is implemented with a concept of port profiling, where measures representing various characteristics of connections are monitored and recorded for each port. Though the generation of the port profiles requires the minimum calculation and memory, they exhibit high stability and robustness. Each port profile retains the patterns of the corresponding connections precisely, even if the connections demonstrate multi-modal characteristics. By comparing the pattern exhibited by live traffic with the expected behavior recorded in the profile, intrusive activities like compromising backdoors or invoking trojan programs are successfully detected.",Scopus,IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems

Emphasis is on the SCOPF algorithms and the insights gained from their implementation. As input, the package requires network security and optimization models (built offline) and a network state solution. The output of a single execution, presented to the control center operator, consists of the static security assessment and five different strategies for security enhancement. Each strategy is the solution of a different SCOPF problem, each having a different mix of base case corrective, precontingent preventive and postcontingent corrective action. The SCOPF solutions incorporate base case and contingent state load flow solutions, network switching, staged constraint and control activation, and linear program solutions. The linear program optimizes the convex subproblem and includes a representation of multiple postcontingent networks simultaneously constraining the current operating state.",Scopus,
4145,4146,Memory-Map Shuffling: An Adaptive Security-Risk Mitigation,"Schnarz P,Wietzke J,Rausch A",,,2017,Conference Paper,"Automotive products, such as electronic control units, evolve increasingly towards adaptive solutions. From many perspectives, solutions need to be flexible with regards to the entire originating process and operation process. Here, the product development cycle, the product life-cycle and even product lines describe the dimensions a solution might have to adapt to. Certain requirements to secure the product continuously add further complexity to the aforementioned dimensions. Adversaries adapt - so the protection shall as well. However, adapting, particularly, technical solutions to products, implies the need for agnostic approaches. In this article, we propose a security-risk mitigation concept which aims to fit into the evolving automotive originating process applied to a particular class of electronic control units. Technically, the proposed approach shuffles the system memory-map of an asynchronous multiprocessing system. On the intermediate layer between the hardware and software, the assignment of memory and resources is obfuscated to a potential adversary who managed to breach one of the higher level memory protection mechanisms. As a result, the proposed mitigation adds either a further level in a defense-in-depth security architecture or fixes a structural vulnerability of certain hardware architectures.",Web of Science,NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADAPTIVE AND SELF-ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS (ADAPTIVE 2017)

The idea behind the cancelable biometric or cancelability is to transform a biometric data or feature into a new one so that the stored biometric template can be easily changed in a biometric security system. In this paper, we present a novel architecture for template generation within the context of the cancelable multimodal system. We develop a novel cancelable biometric template generation algorithm using random projection and transformation-based feature extraction and selection. We further validate the performance of the proposed algorithm on a virtual multi modal face and ear database.",Web of Science,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2013 12TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COGNITIVE INFORMATICS & COGNITIVE COMPUTING (ICCI CC 2013)
