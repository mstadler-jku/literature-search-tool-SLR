3,An Effective Defense Method based on Hash Authentication against Mode-switching Attack of Ormon PLC,"Industrial control system (ICS) integrating different software and hardware is not only to collect, obtain and calculate data information, but also to control the machine or production process so that it can run automatically. Ormon PLCs are widely used in critical manufactures and have adopted factory interface network service (Fins) protocol to exchange message. The recent articles indicate that Ormon PLCs used Fins Ethernet protocol were exposed to mode-switching malicious network attack. However, the traditional detection methods based on function codes and Snort detection rules could not get an ideal result. In this paper, we propose a method that can overcome these problems in dealing with mode-switching attack by an external hash authentication device embedding asymmetric encryption. This security device built into a hash authentication mechanism, which is responsible for identifying and distinguishing the interaction information message between the upper computer and PLC interaction information. In order to validate our method, some experiments have been done to show that defend method can disrupt successfully the communication link between the attacking computer and PLC device to defend this malicious cyber attacks efficiently."
51,Detecting Anomalous Behavior in VoIP Systems: A Discrete Event System Modeling,"Session initiation protocol (SIP) is an application layer protocol used for signaling purposes to manage voice over IP connections. SIP being a text-based protocol is vulnerable to a range of denial of service (DoS) attacks. These DoS attacks can render the SIP servers/SIP proxy servers unusable by depleting memory and CPU time. In this paper, we consider two types of DoS attacks, namely, flooding attacks and coordinated attacks for detection. Flooding attacks affect both stateless and stateful SIP servers while coordinated attacks affect stateful SIP servers. We model the SIP operation as discrete event system (DES) and design a new state transition machine, which we name as probabilistic counting deterministic timed automata (PCDTA) to describe the behavior of SIP operations. We also identify different types of anomalies that can occur in a DES model, which appear in the form of illegal transitions, violating timing constraints, and appear in number which is otherwise not seen. Subsequently, we map various DoS attacks in SIP to a type of anomaly in DES. PCDTA can learn probabilities of various transitions and timings delay from a set of nonmalicious training sequences. A trained PCDTA can detect anomalies, and hence various DoS attacks in SIP. We perform a thorough experiment with computer simulated SIP traffic and report the detection performance of PCDTA on various attacks generated through custom scripts."
67,Towards Further Formal Foundation of Web Security: Expression of Temporal Logic in Alloy and Its Application to a Security Model With Cache,"Security analysis of a web system is complicated, and thus analysis using formal methods to describe system specification mathematically has attracted attention. Some previous studies have adopted formal methods, but their models cannot express parallel communication completely. This limitation gives rise to problems where web functions, such as a cache that stores contents, cannot be defined and attacks that forge contents cannot be analyzed. These problems are present in the Alloy-based implementations of current models that do not have the ability to express temporal logic. Therefore, we design implementation and evaluation of temporal logic in Alloy to express time series and parallel computation for web security analysis. In doing so, state transitions in the web can be expressed by fitting them in our proposed syntax. As concrete applications, we describe a web security model that includes caches and show that our proposed syntax can analyze state-of-the-art attacks, such as unauthorized access to users' account pages via caches. The source code of our proposed model in Alloy is publicly available."
71,Using Conditional Random Fields to Optimize a Self-Adaptive Bell–LaPadula Model in Control Systems,"Once defined, the access control policies and regulations would never be changed in a running and state transition process. However, it will give attackers the possibility of discovering vulnerabilities in the system, and the control systems lack the ability of dynamic perception of security state and risk, causing the systems to be exposed to risks. In this article, a dynamic Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model is proposed. The conditional random field (CRF) is introduced into the BLP model to optimize the rules. First, the model formalizes the security attributes, states of system, transition rules, and constraint models on the basis of the state transition of CRFs. After the historical system access logs are processed as the original dataset, a feature selection method is proposed to extract the requests and current states as feature vectors. Second, this article presents a rules training algorithm based on L-BFGS to implement the study and training of datasets, and then marks the logs in the test set through Viterbi algorithm automatically. On the base of these, a rule generation algorithm is proposed to dynamically adjust the access control rules based on the current security status and events of the system. Third, the security of CRFs-BLP is proved by theoretical analysis. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the model are verified by estimating the value of the precision, recall, and F1-score. As the system threats are shown to be decreased obviously from these experiments, this dynamic model can decrease the vulnerabilities and risk effectively."
124,Dependable Industrial Crypto Computing,"This paper presents a work on how to assure the dependability of a crypto system built across on and off the blockchain by using the proposed adaptive checkpoint and rollback algorithm, and a prototype is developed for demonstration purpose.The theoretical background of the proposed checkpoint and rollback algorithm is studied to characterize the variables affecting the dependability such as security, authenticity and reliability with respect to the rates of hit by any events of those issues, the rates to detect and diagnose, and then the rate to vote for a consensus whether to trigger a rollback or not. Based on the variables characterization in a stochastic manner, then steady state probabilities and state transition probabilities are derived in order to assure the ultimate effective dependability of each individual dependability variable (i.e., security, authenticity and reliability), then finally to assure the dependability in a compound manner with each variable assigned a weight depending on the nature of the systems specifications.Based on the theoretical study, a protype of a crypto system is built to demonstrated the underlying architecture and operations and to justify the need for such system to take synergistic advantages from both on- and off-chain blockchains, with an experimental result of a benefit in gas fee which is the most exigently addressed issue today in blockchain systems especially in Ethereum network of blockchains. An astonishing gas fee saving results are demonstrated. It is observed that the crypto system benefits more if more computationally intensive transactions are executed off-chain while vice versa."
125,Survivability and applicability in database constraints: temporal boundary to data integrity scenarios,"Modern database systems manage very large volume of database constraints. The cost spent in changing constraints is quite expensive because most of integrity requirements have dynamic specifications from applications domain with irregular and intermittent changes. The constraints maintenance can be motivated to scenarios changes that reach the integrity conditions of applications. In these changes, time is a main dimension to represent the boundary of integrity satisfiability in constraints. This article proposes a temporal modelling of variability characteristics in database constraints (survivability and applicability) to represent the time (instant or interval) effectively and efficiently when assertions must be used to enforce the data integrity."
126,BotD: A scalable anomaly-based Bot Detection Architecture for securing web services,"The significance of anomaly detection is increasing as a result of the rapid increase in unknown attacks. With the increase in deployment of scalable web services, there is a need for developing a scalable anomaly detection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a scalable anomaly-based Bot Detection Architecture (BotD) in which different anomaly-based bot detection algorithms can be implemented. Our architecture leverages NF scalability provided by Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and network programmability provided by Software Defined Networking (SDN). We have also proposed a loss-free state transfer technique across NFs. We have simulated our architecture using Mininet and Ryu controller, and tested the functioning of the architecture."
137,Toward the Web of Things: Applying Web Technologies to the Physical World,"Just as Internet connectivity has enabled intuitive information sharing and interaction through the Web, so the Internet of Things might be the basis for the Web of Things, enabling equally simple interaction among devices, systems, users, and applications."
154,An empirical property-based model for vulnerability analysis and evaluation,"This work presents an empirical property-based model to describe web-based vulnerability. We define a web application using a new descriptive model with pre-condition, behavior, entity and communication property sets. The Vulnerable Property Relationship Graph (VPRG) defines a vulnerability as vulnerable properties in application with relations to other properties in cause- and consequence-relationships. The Vulnerable Property Relationship Matrix (VPRM) is used to quantify the existence vulnerability and to measure its impact according to the relations of vulnerable properties to other properties in execution of the web application. A severity score calculation is proposed based on VPRM: the vulnerability severity score is typically the sum of consequence as a result of state changes of every evolving property in the vulnerable property relationship model. The prototype model is applied to a case study involving specified web vulnerabilities."
160,Preserving Contextual Privacy for Smart Home IoT Devices With Dynamic Traffic Shaping,"Internet of Things (IoT) enables physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to interoperate and exchange data with other systems over the Internet. Privacy is a huge concern for IoT devices as personal information is constantly being shared through them. Though the best industrial standards like end-to-end encryption are being followed to ensure content-based privacy, contextual privacy concerns still exist. This study focuses on user activity inference attacks, where a passive network observer can infer the private in-home activity of a user by analyzing encrypted IoT traffic metadata. Most of the previous solutions addressing these attacks have either reduced the usability of the devices, increased data overhead, or failed against packet-level signature-based attack scenarios. This study introduces a new defense mechanism that combines dummy packet generation with dynamic link padding. This process makes it difficult for the adversary to avail contextual information about the state of the device (ON or OFF), along with the temporal information (time of state change) from encrypted IoT traffic metadata. We reverse the packet-level signature-based attacks to get device-specific signatures, which helps us generate dummy traffic for the duration of device-specific signatures. Consequently, this results in increased false positives for device state identifications and low traffic overhead. We simulate a state-of-the-art attack scenario to test and vindicate our solution over existing data sets."
171,Reactive and Adaptive Security Monitoring in Cloud Computing,"Cloud computing enabled service-level agreements (SLAs) to gain widespread use among information systems stakeholders. It is now normal for performance and availability of such systems to be carefully measured and evaluated. Contracts that include financial penalties in case of breach are now common. However security is lagging behind this trend; it is as important to stakeholders as performance and availability, but is generally not included in the scope of service-level agreements between stakeholders, and handled instead on a best-effort basis, without any transparency nor SLA with their clients. One reason for this is the difficulty of objectively measuring security. Indeed, the actual security level of a system is dependent on a wide range of factors, some intrinsic to the system - such as a design or implementation mistake resulting in a vulnerability - and some extrinsic to it. For instance, an external event such as the publication of a vulnerability in an open-source software dependency or a change of political context in a country can widely impact the risks faced by an information system even if no actual change were made to the system. These factors are even more numerous in multi-tenant cloud infrastructures because of the sheer number of actors involved - and their sometimes conflicting incentives - and opportunities for both attack and defense at scale. Security monitoring aims to detect and react to attacks in real time; Reactive security monitoring intends to take external events into account while doing so. Improving the accuracy of a system's overall security assessment can help transitioning security to a SLA paradigm and enable better transparency for all stakeholders."
194,Development and application of on-line dynamic security early warning and preventive control system in China,"This paper presents an early warning and preventive control system for dynamic security, which has been used in several provincial power grids in China. The framework and the main modules of the proposed system are introduced. The system architecture is based on a Multi-agent system which is developed by our team. The modules like on-line contingency assessment, total transfer capacity evaluation, preventive and corrective control schemes etc. are developed in this system. To estimate the forthcoming state's security level, all these modules also run in the forecasted 15-minutes ahead operating state. And some key technologies, such as PEBS based contingency screen and distributed computing technology, are used to improve the efficiency of the system to accommodate real-time application. Enhanced total transfer capacity calculating (TTC) method are developed which can both calculate pessimistic value and optimistic value of TTC in the same time. The preventive control algorithm is developed which is based on transient energy function sensitivity. Some engineering-oriented methods are also introduced which are used to solve practical problems emerged in real application. In the last part of the paper, some data from a real system in a provincial power grid is introduced."
240,Extended DACS Scheme Implementing Security Function,"When customers with different membership and position use computers as in the university network systems, it often takes much time and efforts for them to manage a network system. This is because the requirements for the respective computer usage are different in network and security policies. In this paper, the destination addressing control system scheme (DACS scheme) for the university network services is shown. The DACS scheme performs network management efficiently through the communication control of a client. As the characteristic of DACS scheme, only the setup modification is required by a system administrator, when configuration change of the network system is done. Then, the setup modification by a customer is unnecessary, which shows a merit for both the system administrator and the customer. But, there are some security problems to be solved. In this paper, secure DACS scheme is proposed and examined. Secure DACS scheme has functions to prevent the communication from the client which DACS client is not installed in and to prevent information interception."
273,"Modeling Approaches for System-of-Systems Dynamic Architecture: Overview, Taxonomy and Future Prospects","System-of-Systems (SoS) result from the collaboration of independent Constituent Systems (CSs), connected in a certain configuration known as an architectural configuration, to achieve a common mission. The architectural configuration may change as new CS may join SoS and/or existing CS may leave SoS at runtime. These architectural configuration changes have affect on the overall system quality attributes (i.e. performance, security and reliability). Therefore, modelling SoS architecture is a challenging task as CSs and the possible architectural configurations are not entirely known at design time. Architectural description languages (ADLs) have been proposed and used to deal with SoS dynamic architecture. However, we still envision gaps to be bridged and challenges to be addressed in the forthcoming years. This paper outline a taxonomy for modeling SoS and provides a broad discussion on the state-of-the-art modeling notations to model and analyze SoS architectural configuration. An SoS case is presented to explain the impact of architectural configurational changes on the SoS properties. Besides, we also discuss challenges and future directions to be overcome in the forthcoming years."
277,Real-Time Scheduling with Security Enhancement for Packet Switched Networks,"Real-time network applications depend on schedulers to guarantee the quality of service (QoS). Conventional real-time schedulers focus on the timing constraints but are much less effective in satisfying the security requirements. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security-aware scheduling system for packet switched networks using a real-time multi-agent design model. The proposed system combines real-time scheduling with security service enhancement. The scheduling unit uses the differentiated-earliest-deadline-first (Diff-EDF) scheduler and the security enhancement scheme adopts a congestion control mechanism. The required QoS is guaranteed for different types (audio and video) of real-time data flows, while the packet security levels are adaptively enhanced according to the feedbacks from the congestion control module. Compared with the IPsec protocol, the proposed scheme reduces the number of pending packets at the destinations. In implementation, the proposed scheme can overload the priority code point and the virtual-LAN identifier fields of the IEEE 802.1Q frame format, hence eliminating the overhead of the security associations performed by the IPsec protocol."
294,Assessing the Impact of Insufficient Situation Awareness on Power System Operation,"Situation awareness is a key factor in preserving power system security, as it enables effective and timely decision-making and reactions by the operators to an incident. Insufficient situation awareness results in a delayed, incorrect or deficient response, endangering power system stability. This factor was actually identified as one of the main causes of several electrical disturbances in the last decade. This paper identifies numerous factors that govern the formation of situation awareness in a power system control center. A multi-state model based on Markov modeling is proposed for assessing the impact of insufficient situation awareness on the probability of power system blackouts. The proposed model considers the level of situation awareness and the state of the information infrastructure. The workings of this model are illustrated using the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System."
297,Adaptive security level for data aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks,"This work introduces a novel secure data aggregation framework for Wireless Sensor Networks. It ensures the accuracy of data aggregation value without neglecting energy efficiency, even if all aggregator nodes and some of sensors are compromised in the network. Compared to available solutions in which malicious data aggregation result is rejected by base station and then all steps in aggregation process are cancelled resulting in wasting valuable network resource, our framework relies on adaptive monitoring mechanism that can always provide base station by the correct aggregate result reducing thus total data rejection and providing much higher availability than other security protocols."
304,Application of pattern recognition to security assessment and enhancement in power systems,"There has been a very rapid increase in the size of power systems, and it is still growing. This growth has made the present day systems very big and complex. The complexity is arising especially due to many Interconnections, different types of loads and larger generating units. Also there is uncertainty in load forecasting. With EHV interconnections the disturbances are felt even in geographically distant parts of the system, increasing the severity of the disturbances. These factors make the satisfactory operating of the system a more difficult task. Added to this, Society is becoming more dependent on electric power; and it is essential to make the power available to customers without any interruption and within certain limits of voltage and frequency variations. This means that there is a great need to ensure that a system is as economical, reliable and secure as possible [1]. High reliability of the system is usually obtained by following the principles of bulk power supply planning. However, due to delay in commissioning of new plants and equipment, equipment outages, unexpected load demands and disturbances, the system may be forced to operate in or close to critical and emergency conditions. Hence, in addition to sophisticated planning and designing of the system, an effective operation and control of power systems is essential. The maintenance of a system in a reliable and secure mode is becoming an Important part of the Job of the operators. In the past, more emphasis was given to economic operation; but in view of the consequences of power failures, reliable and secure operation of the system is being given more importance. Security assessment deals with the tracking of the system and deciding whether the present state is secure or not. If the system's state is found to be insecure, it forewarns the operator to take possible remedial action or to be ready for the disturbance if it takes place. This is done before any disturbance (which may lead to failure or deterioration in the quality of supply) occurS. Thus security evaluation is essentially an on-line procedure. The paper will discuss the different operating states of a power system, system security and different approaches for transient security assessment. Recent research results applying the pattern recognition approach will be summarized and presented."
329,Forming the multi-modal situation context in ambient intelligence systems on the basis of self-organizing cognitive architectures,The article provides a theoretical basis of multi-agent recursive cognitive architectures as a distributed intelligent system of decision-making and control of an ambient intelligence system. It is dealt with the formalization of such cognitive architectures based on recursive deterministic abstract automata. The work introduces a method of automatic contexts formation in systems of ambient security based on the formal representation of semantics. Attempts are made to model and visualize semantic primitives and contexts. Successful experiments on the multi-agent representation of the subset of natural language limited by the domain of ambient assisted living systems for elderly people were conducted.
348,Impact of erroneous measurements on power system real-time security analysis,"Power system security analyses as well as decisions made to preserve system security are all on the basis of an approximate insight over the system status. This approximate insight is provided based on erroneous measurements throughout the system. The error in the input data may result in a misleading index which either increases system operating costs or jeopardizes service continuity. This paper aims at establishing an step-by-step algorithm to study impacts of error in measurements on system security indices. Two different security indices representing under voltage severity and over load severity are studied in this paper. The proposed algorithm has three major steps. In the first step, typical measurements are sampled according to the system operating state and randomly generated errors. This is done using Monte Carlo sampling approach. The second step is to extract an approximate model of the system true state which is done via state estimators. Then, security indices are calculated for both the approximated and true states in the third step. Comparison between the indices demonstrates impacts of the erroneous measurements on security assessment."
355,Performance Analysis of Lightweight Algorithm GIFT-COFB for 3-D Printer Security,"Secure lightweight algorithms have lately been proving their benefits and applications in resource-constrained environments. 3-D printers in a distributed network need security approval for their authentic and secure utilization. NIST round 2 algorithm GIFT-COFB and its primitive algorithm GIFT have been tested for their performance for STL files used in 3-D printers. GIFT-COFB is an Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithm, an underlying scheme for which is the GIFT-128 lightweight block cipher. We analyze the power consumed, energy consumed and time taken by the algorithm for the encryption and decryption of a particular STL file. Then a comparison of state-of-the-art parameters of GIFT-COFB and GIFT is carried out to show the improvements we achieved by using the COFB lightweight AEAD operating mode. Analysis results show its worth in providing security to STL files. For further improvement in the system, signal processing can be applied."
358,Dynamic security regions of power systems,"A method for deriving dynamic security regions of power systems is developed. A power system operating state is defined to be dynamically secure with respect to a given disturbance if the system, starting in that state maintains transient stability after experiencing the disturbance. Specifically, these are regions of prefault angles such that the post-fault system is asymptotically stable. The proposed approach is to construct affine approximations to the nonlinearities in the transient stability model and then derive quadratic bounds on the errors between the nonlinearities and their approximation. These are then used to derive sufficient conditions for a polytope of operating states to be dynamically secure."
377,Threat modeling at run time: the case for reflective and adaptive threat management (NIER track),"Threat modeling is an analysis activity aimed at eliciting viable and realistic security and privacy threats in the design of a software-intensive system. Threat modeling allows for a by-design approach, mitigating problems before they arise and avoiding later costly development efforts. However, it mainly pays off in software construction approaches that rely on planned architectures, in which sources of threats can be anticipated beforehand. These axiomatic assumptions are, however, increasingly untrue in contemporary software development practices in which software systems evolve drastically in later stages. In addition, software-intensive systems are increasingly faced with uncertainty in their operational contexts, and these are nearly impossible to enumerate in early development stages. In this article, we first present the idea of reflective threat modeling, which involves the automated derivation of architectural system models from run-time and operational system artifacts, providing the threat modeler with an accurate and workable run-time inspection view of the system. We then outline and motivate the potential of adopting threat analysis models as a basis for holistic and adaptive threat management through integration of adaptive security and privacy technologies. This will enable systems to autonomously respond to emerging threats by dynamically activating dedicated controls or via run-time reconfiguration."
385,The method of selecting the operation modes of the multifunctional HF radio,"The article proposes the method for determining the operation modes of the multifunctional radio using the theory of fuzzy logic. The method takes into account the requirements for customers of various categories of importance. The method implements two ways of evaluating the effectiveness of each of the available operating modes of the radio. In the first case, the timely, credibility and security of information transmission on the specified radio route is evaluated. In the second case, the system supports decision-making based on the expert assessment is used. The method would be used for the development of an automated system decided to determine the operation modes of a multifunctional radio."
391,Intel case study: Software on demand,"This paper presents the application of the software as a service (SaaS) approach of software streaming. Streaming refers to downloading software to client hardware platforms for temporary local execution. OS and application software is managed from a centralized server and provided only on-demand. Users obtain a clean, consistent, current build each time they log in, removing the nuisance of security patching and rebooting for environmental changes. Local execution and caching preserves user experience comparable to traditionally installed applications. To explore feasibility, Intel conducted a proof-of-concept (POC) to evaluate streaming in its call center and manufacturing environments on multi-user systems. The four-part study included performance, usability, IT operations and total cost of ownership (TCO). The proof-of-concept was successful in identifying streaming as a feasible technology with good performance and positive TCO in the tested scenarios. The biggest benefits were related to locking down the client and thus eliminating service calls related to configuration changes, software installation and viruses. The major challenges encountered were around the high learning curve and the software maturity related to packing applications for streaming. Based on the strong positive outcome of the POC, Intel has added streaming to its IT roadmaps."
404,A honeypot system for wearable networks,"Securing any information exchanged within a Body Area Network (BAN) from unauthorized tampering is essential to ensure that such systems are safe, and thus do no harm, to the people using them. Solutions for enabling information security in BANs require extensive use of cryptographic primitives that involve considerable performance overhead. Consequently, information security is typically not available in wearable technologies. We need adaptive security solutions that increase the level of security in the event of threats but otherwise impose minimal security overhead in order for them to viable for BANs. The first step in building adaptive security for BANs is to detect the threats. In this paper we propose a solution for detecting adversaries attacking the communication channel of a BAN called a wearable honeypot system. It works by communicating fake user health information between the base station and a set of designated decoy nodes in the BAN. Any alteration of this traffic, in content or arrival time, is considered adversarial tampering. A preliminary implementation of this wearable honeypot system demonstrates that it is effective in detecting a variety of communication attacks on a BAN."
407,Resolution-based proof for multi-modal temporal logics of knowledge,Temporal logics of knowledge are useful in order to specify complex systems in which agents are both dynamic and have information about their surroundings. We present a resolution method for propositional temporal logic combined with multi-modal S5 and illustrate its use on examples. This paper corrects a previous proposal for resolution in multi-model temporal logics of knowledge.
410,Digital low-impedance bus differential protection with reduced requirements for CTs,"The paper presents a new algorithm, its implementation, and results of extensive testing, for a microprocessor-based low-impedance busbar relay. For increased security, the presented technique combines percent differential and current directional protection principles. The directional (phase comparison) principle does not require a voltage signal as it responds to relative directions of the currents. For fast operation, the outlined approach uses an adaptive trip logic that shifts between the 2-of-of-2 operating mode and the differential principle alone depending on a detection of CT saturation. The saturation detector responds to a differential-restraint current trajectory and is capable of detecting saturation occurring as fast as approximately 2 msec into a fault. The presented solution is implemented as a centralized type microprocessor-based relay with a sub-cycle tripping time and exceptional immunity to CT saturation."
418,Modbus/DNP3 state-based filtering system,"The security of SCADA systems is one of the most pressing subjects in industrial systems, especially for those installation actively using the public network in order to provide new features and services. In this paper we present an innovative approach to the design of Filtering Systems based on the state analysis of the system being monitored. The aim is to detect attacks composed of a set of “SCADA” commands that, while licit when considered in isolation on a single-packet basis, can disrupt the correct behavior of the system when executed in particular operating states. The proposed firewall detects these complex attacks thanks to an internal representation of the controlled SCADA system. Furthermore, we detail the design of the architecture of the IDS for systems using the ModBus and DNP3 protocols, and the implementation of a prototype, providing experimental comparative results that confirm the validity of the proposed approach."
435,"Adaptive SSL: Design, Implementation and Overhead Analysis","Adaptive security is based on the observation that the security requirements of a system or service heavily depend on the environment in which they operate and should therefore be dynamically adjusted to best operate within that environment as the environment changes. In this paper we are concerned with adapting the choice of cryptographic algorithms applied to client-server interactions. To that end, we design and implement an adaptation controller for SSL (Secure Socket Layer), called Adaptive SSL."
444,New architecture of Direct RF Sampling for avionic systems applied to VOR and ILS,"In the aerospace industry, there is an increased demand for a new kind of avionic architecture, in order to reduce cost, weight, number of components, certification, installation and maintenance complexity, while improving the security, compatibility and RF efficiency. The key solution to achieve this goal is to integrate multiple avionic systems, apply new signal processing and RF capabilities. A generalized and reconfigurable architecture of Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) with integrated and modularised structure based on Direct RF Sampling (DRFS) and Software Defined Radio (SDR) is presented in this paper for avionic applications. The proposed architecture is composed of a DRFS digital receiver integrated within a SDR software modules. DRFS technology is adopted in the digital receiver, which consists of Pre-selection Filters and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to provide flexible compatibility for diverse modulation modes and various RF/IF frequency bands. By employing the concept of DRFS/SDR, distinct procedures for different avionic purposes, such as Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) and Instrument Landing System (ILS), can be achieved in the same hardware platform. Notably, this proposed architecture has the potential to be reconfigured and improved in several ways without any hardware change to accommodate new features and signal capabilities. As per experimental validation phase, an MMR integrated system for VOR and ILS receivers has been designed and implemented. Test results have illustrated that the implementation feasibility of multi-mode DRFS avionic receivers is beneficial and efficient using the proposed architecture. Moreover, the benefits obtained from this new approach are not only covering miniaturization, lightweight, and low power consumption but is also promising to overreach the equivalent commercial systems in the future."
445,Partial cuts in attack graphs for cost effective network defence,"Because of increasing vulnerabilities, maturing attack tools, and increasing dependence on computer network infrastructure, tools to support network defenders are essential. Course-of-action recommendation research has often assumed a goal of perfect network security. In reality, network administrators balance security with usability and so tolerate vulnerabilities and imperfect security. We provide realistic course-of-action decision support for network administrators by minimizing connectivity in attack graphs, by optimizing network configuration changes to separate defence goals from attackers as much as possible, even when complete security is impractical. We introduce vertex closures and closure-relation graphs in AND/OR digraphs as the underlying framework. Computing an optimal course-of-action is NP-hard but we design a polynomial-time greedy algorithm that almost always produces an optimal solution."
468,Effect of intrusion detection on secure group communications in hierarchically structured group architectures,"We develop a class of adaptive security protocols with designs to allow group communication systems (GCSs) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) to dynamically adjust operational settings to best satisfy application-imposed performance and security requirements, leveraging the inherent tradeoff between security and performance properties of the system. These adaptive security protocols include an intrusion detection protocol for dealing with insider attacks and a scalable region-based hierarchical group key management protocol for dealing with outsider attacks. Our design settings include the time interval over which intrusion detection should be performed, and the regional area size for the region-based hierarchical group key management protocol for group key management. When given a set of parameter values characterizing operational and environmental conditions of a GCS, we identify optimal design settings to be used by the system dynamically to maximize the mean time to security failure of the system while minimizing the total group communication cost incurred for GCSs in MANET environments."
480,Assessment of Integrated Electronic Information System survivability based on u-function,"Considering vulnerable Integrative electronic information system (IEIS) operating under influence of external impacts and internal failures, the elements of IEIS work with different reliability and performance characteristics. In this paper we divided IEIS into basic element categories and element categories, which wok in multi-states. Basic element categories can meet its specified mission, which must be satisfied in survivability analysis. We define survivability as the performance of the basic element categories, and then get this performance using u-function to denote the survivability of IEIS, considering influence of external impacts and internal failures. The evaluation method is useful to combine the performance of the basic element categories and its survivability, and improve the survivability of the IEIS based on the basic elements in poor performance."
497,Combining Multimodal DNN and SigPid technique for detecting Malicious Android Apps,"Google announced that they are 2.7 billion active Android users in the world. There are different categories of mobile apps available, based on development nature and different categories, for example apps based on development nature are native apps, hybrid apps, web apps and apps based on different categories are gaming, business, educational, lifestyle, entertainment and utility etc. Due to its scalable growing and open source nature it is easily vulnerable to hackers or attackers to steal our information and inject malware apps into our mobile system. In recent days, a new malware app called Joker was introduced in the mobile market and infected 24 apps in the Google store, which mainly focus on extracting money and credential information from the users without their knowledge. Many scientific researches are undergoing to identify android malicious apps using machine learning classification approach. In this paper, the deep neural network algorithm is chosen to detect Android Malware by extracting features from the Android Manifest file and java API modules then fed into Deep Neural network (DNN) [10] classifier to detect whether the apps as malicious or benign app. This paper combines the Sigpid [1] (Significant Permission Identification) technique which is given as a feature in Multimodal DNN. SigPid was evaluated as a high probability of detecting malware apps using Permissions. The goal is to implement an efficient framework for detecting the Android Malware apps using Machine learning techniques which can be used in App store where all the applications are deployed in cloud and also in Mobile Antivirus app, to detect the harmfulness of the app."
504,Key security challenges for cloud-assisted connected and autonomous vehicles,"Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) bring situational awareness to vehicles promising a safer transportation system. To support collaborative awareness, cloud-assisted CAV are being developed besides Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications. CAVs require efficient and accurate information from numerous sources, internal and external to the vehicle, for time-critical safety applications. As such, cloud-assisted CAVs would be exposed to a large amount of dynamic information (such as speed, location, vehicle ID, travel routes, passengers' personal information, bank details and so on). Moreover, CAVs have a reasonably long lifetime due to which the associated vehicular technologies in CAVs age and it is possible that vulnerabilities can be exploited to inflict harm. As a result, when technologies change, the security requirements evolve. This research aims to discuss significant research challenges, classify emerging threats, attacks and countermeasures and identify immediate research directions to protect the evolving cloud-assisted CAVs with security mechanisms to adapt to complex and dynamic environments."
515,A Novel Model of Mimic Defense Based on Minimal L-Order Error Probability,"Mimic defense is an active defense theory, which aims to fundamentally change the “easy to attack and difficult to defend” situation of network security. In this paper, we propose an evaluation method based on the probability of being attack successfully, and improve the evaluation scheme of historical confidence. We combine the two evaluation schemes with the TOPSIS (technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution) algorithm, and finally form a complete heterogeneous variant dynamic scheduling model. Different from traditional multi-mode voting algorithms, the effect of the heterogeneous degree in voting is considered, and we use Bayesian estimation to obtain the optimal result in the probabilistic sense. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively enhance the dynamic and security of the mimic defense model, and give full play to the characteristics of mimic defense."
544,Cyber-physical and networked sensor systems: Challenges and opportunities,"Rapid advancements in embedded systems, sensors and wireless communication technologies have led to the development of cyber-physical systems, pervasive computing and smart environments with important applications such as smart grids, sustainability, health care and security. Wireless sensor networks play significant role in building such systems as they can effectively act as the human-physical interface with the digital world through sensing, communication, computing and control or actuation. However, the inherent characteristics of wireless sensor networks, typified by resource constraints, high degree of uncertainty, heterogeneity and distributed control pose significant challenges. After introducing the basic challenges, opportunities and applications, this talk will present a novel framework for multi-modal context recognition from sensor streaming data, context-aware data fusion, and situation-aware decision making with a trade-off between information accuracy (hence inference quality) and energy consumption. The underlying approach is based on dynamic Bayesian model, information theoretic reasoning, and game theory. The talk will be concluded with open issues and future directions of research."
548,Ecological Robustness-Oriented Grid Network Design for Resilience Against Multiple Hazard,"Power systems are critical infrastructure for reliable and secure electric energy delivery. Incidents are increasing, as unexpected multiple hazards ranging from natural disasters to cyberattacks threaten the security and functionality of society. Inspired by resilient ecosystems, this paper presents a resilient network design approach with an ecological robustness (RECO)-oriented optimization to improve power systems' ability to maintain a secure operating state throughout unknown hazards. The approach uses RECO, a surprisal-based metric that captures key features of an ecosystem's resilient structure, as an objective to strategically design the electrical network. The approach enables solvability and practicality by introducing a stochastic-based candidate branch creation algorithm and a Taylor series expansion for relaxation of the RECO formulation. Finally, studies are conducted on the RECO-oriented approach using the IEEE 24 Bus RTS and the ACTIVSg200 systems. Results demonstrate improvement of the system's reliability under multiple hazards, network properties of robust structure and equally distributed power flows, and survivability against cascading failures. From the analysis, we observe that a more redundant network structure with equally distributed power flows benefits its resilience."
550,Studying Advanced Firewalls,"A Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) is a security device that combines a firewall, an antivirus, an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and VPN functionalities. This chapter focuses on ASA models, modes of using ASA equipment, and an overview of ASA 5505. It discusses the types of ASA licenses, and configuring of the interfaces, DHCP service, ACLs, network address translation (NAT) service, and AAA. The chapter also discusses the configuring of Cisco devices using the Cisco Configuration Professional and Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) graphic tools. There are different models of ASAs. All the models offer advanced firewall and VPN functionalities. The biggest difference between the models is the maximal flow of traffic that can be managed by each model and the number and the types of interfaces. An ASA model is chosen based on the requirements of an organization such as the flow, maximal connections per second and the company's budget."
586,Requirements and Specifications for Adaptive Security: Concepts and Analysis,"In an adaptive security-critical system, security mechanisms change according to the type of threat posed by the environment. Specifying the behavior of these systems is difficult because conditions of the environment are difficult to describe until the system has been deployed and used for a length of time. This paper defines the problem of adaptation in security-critical systems, and outlines the RELAIS approach for expressing requirements and specifying the behavior in a way that helps identify the need for adaptation, and the appropriate adaptation behavior at runtime. The paper introduces the notion of adaptation via input approximation and proposes statistical machine learning techniques for realizing it. The approach is illustrated with a running example and is applied to a realistic security example from a cloud-based file-sharing application. Bayesian classification and logistic regression methods are used to implement adaptive specifications and these methods offer different levels of adaptive security and usability in the file-sharing application."
589,Applicability of Security Metrics for Adaptive Security Management in a Universal Banking Hub System,"Banking applications require a high standard of security, resilience and adaptation. The results presented here were obtained from a case study of the deployment of the security metrics-driven adaptive security solutions of a distributed middleware in the context of monetary transfers. The focus of this study is on the analysis of the applicability of security metrics for adaptive authentication, authorization, and end-to-end confidentiality, and the applicability of trust metrics."
605,Threat Modeling for Security Assessment in Cyberphysical Systems,"In this paper, threat modeling issues in cyberphysical systems are discussed. First a generic model of a cyberphysical system is outlined, with an attack surface suitable for security analysis. Then, a case study of network communication in a road vehicle is presented, with its behavior modeled by a discrete time Markov chain, under the assumption that security violations can cause gradual degradation of functionality. Finally, two ways of numerical assessment of vulnerabilities are analyzed, to help better estimate probabilities of state changes in a Markov model."
625,Position Paper: A Case for Exposing Extra-Architectural State in the ISA,"The recent Meltdown and Spectre attacks took the community by surprise. Rather than exploiting an incorrect implementation of the ISA, these attacks leverage the undocumented implementation-specific speculation behavior of high-performance microarchitectures to affect the extra-architectural state of the machine (e.g., caches).Inspired by these novel speculation-based attacks, we argue it is time to rethink the traditional ISA layers. Programmers and security professionals need a framework to reason about the effects of speculation and other microarchitectural performance optimizations. We propose judiciously extending the ISA to include the extra-architectural state so that an ISA implementation either completely squashes all system state changes caused by mis-speculated instructions or the potential changes are rigorously documented. We hope this new framework will give architects and security researchers tools to reduce the likelihood of future surprise vulnerabilities."
662,An Adaptive Confidentiality Security Service Enhancement Protocol Using Image-Based Key Generator for Multi-Agent Ethernet Packet Switched Networks,"Conventional network Security Protocols provide different types of security services that establish secure connections between network nodes making them robust against different security threats. The security establishment process depends on sharing security keys between connected devices. The level of security provided by such security protocols is static and irrelevant to the status of the network. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security-aware lottery-EDF scheduler for limited resources Ethernet packet switched networks using GAIA multi-agent approach. The proposed system adopts a periodic nonshared cryptographic key-generation process of different sizes (i.e., 64 bits, 128 bits, 160 bits, and 512 bits) using the textural features of digital images stored on a central imageserver. The proposed system deploys a security enhancement unit that adaptively enhances the confidentiality security-service level for the real-time packets according to feedback from a congestion control scheme that is based on network resource estimation technique, hence making the network robust against the spoofing security threat while preserving the overall network performance metrics (NPMs). By simulating a realtime Ethernet packet switched network, extensive simulation results show the efficiency of the adaptive proposed protocol over the static-security and IPSec protocols in guaranteeing the QoS requirements for the real-time flows in terms of destination’s buffer consumption and average total packet delays © 2023 by the authors.

679,Optimizing distributed firewall reconfiguration transients,"The flexibility and dynamism brought over by softwarization for network management have increased the frequency of configuration changes. In this context, when a distributed security function is subject to a series of configuration changes, a problem that arises is the preservation of the security. The transient from the application of the first change to the last one may present unsecure temporary states, where the required security protection is missing. Establishing a safe scheduling of the configuration changes can significantly limit the number of unsecure states and decrease the time period where the network may be at risk. However, the literature challenged this problem only for centralized firewalls or SDN switches, and without applying formal methods to ensure the correctness of the computed scheduling. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper addresses the problem for distributed firewalls, aiming to satisfy the largest number of user-specified network security policies in each transient state. To this end, it proposes a formal methodology relying on the combination of three main features: automation, formal verification and optimization. This combination is achieved by pursuing a correctness-by-construction approach, based on the formulation of a Maximum Satisfiability Modulo Theories problem. A framework has been developed on the basis of this methodology, so that validation tests have been experimentally executed to assess the feasibility, efficacy and scalability of the approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
696,Regularity-Based Virtualization under the ARINC 653 Standard for Embedded Systems,"In embedded real-time virtualized systems (ERTVS), the ARINC 653 standard specifies a cyclic scheduling policy to guarantee the real-time performance of tasks in multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) residing on shared hardware. Based on this policy, the Regularity-based Resource Partitioning (RRP) model defines an efficient interface specification to hierarchically partition and assign resource slices among VMs. Although this model has received plenty of attention recently, three major pieces remain missing for applying this model in ERTVS. (1) Embedded systems are more sensitive to resource utilization efficiency since this may drastically affect their deployment cost for including additional cores. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal and an approximate RRP resource scheduler for multi-core platforms. (2) A resource reconfiguration is required when an embedded system has to switch between operating modes, resulting in the current cyclic schedule being replaced by another pre-configured and verified cyclic schedule. This paper formalizes a new One-Hop Reconfiguration (OHR) problem tailored for mode-switch-capable embedded systems and introduces a corresponding optimal solution. (3) No RRP-based toolset is currently available for embedded systems. This paper thus presents an optimized RRP toolset tailored for embedded systems. Numerous experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of this toolset.  © 1968-2012 IEEE."
704,Multi-modal cyber security based object detection by classification using deep learning and background suppression techniques,"Foreground object recognition in video is critical in many computer vision applications and automated video surveillance systems. Object detection and tracking are critical steps in navigation, object recognition and surveillance schemes. Object detection is process of separating foreground and background items in photographs. In this paper, we proposes a framework for achieving these tasks with the enhanced cyber security control facility. This proposed algorithmperformed in 2 stages: multi-object detection utilizing the Cyber secure Probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model (Cy_SPGMM) and background suppression and another stage is multiple moving objects tracking utilizing Kernel convoluted moving window with Kalman filter (KCMW_KF). It can, however, deal with a variety of video sequences in the MOT 20 dataset. The experimental findings reveal that the proposed algorithm detects and tracks foreground objects in complex and dynamic scenarios with high accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. This method also produces smoothened images without noise. © 2022"
705,Dynamic Security Assessment For Power System Using Attribute Selection Technique,"The evaluation of the dynamic security of the electrical power system after the occurrence of disturbances in the network is one of the most important tools that the control center uses to maintain the system in a safe operating mode, as well as prevent cases of system out of control and cases of complete shutdown. With the annual increase in the size of the electrical system and its distribution over a very wide geographical area, this led to a new challenge to assess dynamic security assessment (DSA), which is dealing with a huge and varied amount of data that requires processing in a very short time. To address these challenges, this study presented a new technique of artificial intelligence, which is the attribute selection technique, to reduce the size of this data and thus improve the accuracy and speed of results. This method relied on the combination of decision tree (DT) algorithms and a technique attribute selection in the data obtained from the test system IEEE-30Bus Model. The results of this method showed a significant reduction in the number of data used, which amounted to 77.27% of the total data, which led to an improvement in the classification accuracy, as the classification accuracy reached 97.39%. This reduction is very important when dealing in the online operating environment, as it saves the time necessary to reach the most accurate evaluation decision and thus issue gives a greater opportunity to take the appropriate decision in the event of disturbances and keep the power system in a secure case. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

706,Research on a PSO-H-SVM-Based Intrusion Detection Method for Industrial Robotic Arms,"The automation and intelligence of industrial manufacturing is the core of the fourth industrial revolution, and robotic arms and proprietary networked information systems are an integral part of this vision. However, with the benefits come risks that have been overlooked, and robotic arms have become a heavily attacked area. In order to improve the security of the robotic arm system, this paper proposes an intrusion detection method based on a state classification model. The closure operation process of the robotic arm is divided into five consecutive states, while a support vector machine based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-H-SVM) classifies the operation state of the robotic arm. In the detection process, the classifier predicts the operation state of the robotic arm in real time, and the detection method determines whether the state transfer meets the logical requirements, and then determines whether the intrusion occurs. In addition, a response mechanism is proposed on the basis of the intrusion detection system to make protection measures for the robotic arm system. Finally, a physical experiment platform was built to test the intrusion detection method. The results showed that the classification accuracy of the PSO-H-SVM algorithm reached 96.02%, and the detection accuracy of the intrusion detection method reached 90%, which verified the effectiveness and reliability of the intrusion detection method. © 2022 by the authors.

710,Predicting reliability of software in industrial systems using a Petri net based approach: A case study on a safety system used in nuclear power plant,"Context: Software reliability prediction in the early stages of development can be propitious in many ways. The combinatorial models used to predict reliability using architectures such as fault trees, binary decision diagrams, etc. have limitations in modeling complex system behavior. On the other hand, state-based models such as Markov chains suffer from the state-space explosion problem, and they need transition probability among different system states to measure reliability. These probabilities are usually assumed or are obtained from the operational profile for which the system should be used in the field. Objective: The objective of this paper is to present a method for predicting the reliability of software in industrial systems using a generalized stochastic Petri nets based approach. The key idea is to violate the assumption of state transition probabilities in the Markov chain. The state transition probabilities are calculated using Petri net transitions’ throughput by performing stationary analysis under the consideration to identify and handle dead markings in the Petri net. Method: Initially, a generalized stochastic Petri net of the system under consideration is generated from the standard system's specification. Thereafter, dead markings are identified in the Petri net which are further removed to perform steady-state analysis. At last, a Markov model is generated based on the reachability graph of the Petri net, which is further used to predict the system reliability. Results: The presented method has been applied to a safety-critical system, Shut Down System-1, of a nuclear power plant, which is operational in the Canada Deuterium Uranium reactor. The predicted reliability of the system using this method is 99.99966% which has been validated using the specified system requirements. To further validate and generalize the results, sensitivity analysis is performed by varying different system parameters. Conclusions: The method discussed in this paper presents a step of performing structural analysis on the Petri net of the system under consideration to identify and handle dead markings on the Petri net. It further handles the issue of assuming transition probabilities among the system states by calculating them using Petri net transitions’ throughput. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
757,Threat Modelling of Cyber–Physical Systems Using an Applied π-Calculus,"Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) are distributed systems in which the state of the physical system is generally not observable in non-trivial cases, and where state transitions of this physical system can also occur without resulting in immediate changes to observable variables. This poses challenges for the bidirectional synchronisation of the discrete cyber models and the partially continuous physical systems. Threats to CPS from cyber attacks are, however, often instantiable only where conditions on the CPS state during the attack meet certain conditions such that they drive the system state outside a desirable or safe space. In this paper we propose an extension to an applied π-calculus in which we can capture both the behaviour of the CPS as well as modelling possible adversary behaviour. This is achieved by embedding an algebraic representation of Attack–Defence Trees (ADT) in the applied π-calculus and augmenting this by the addition of a partial ordering over the constituents of the ADT within the embedding, offering an elegant mechanism to extend ADT to ordering and time-related attacks. We illustrate the modelling approach for the case of an electrical substation fragment in which components communicate via the IEC 61850 protocol. © 2021 The Authors"
764,Toward securing the control plane of 5G mobile networks against DoS threats: Attack scenarios and promising solutions,"With the advent of the fifth generation (5G) technology, a plethora of revolutionary applications can now be supported. This tremendous growth will be certainly accompanied by a wider and fast-evolving security threat landscape, especially when the potential of massive devices connectivity will be fully unleashed. In this paper, we outline the security challenges faced by the 5G radio access network (5G-RAN) control plane as a result of the functional and architectural enhancements made at the radio resource control (RRC) protocol layer. We correspondingly analyze the dynamics of the new 5G RRC three-states model for a machine-type traffic pattern under an attack-free situation. Afterwards, we introduce and describe two RRC-based denial of service (DoS) attacks threatening the 5G-RAN resources availability. In the first threat scenario, the attacker maliciously manipulates the timing of state transitions in an attempt to overload the control plane. The second attack can be carried out through faking huge on-demand system information requests to prevent legitimate consumers from access to the cell and cause failed and interrupted 5G mobile services. Through numerical simulations, we measure the potential impact of these attacks on both 5G devices using the collision probability along with the access delay metrics, and on the critical gNB-centralized unit using the signaling overhead and the resource occupancy time metrics. Our observations reveal that both attacks can have disastrous effects on network stability and resiliency. Finally, some promising solutions are listed, with a special emphasis on injecting randomness into system parameters to complicate the task of designing such DoS attacks. © 2021"
775,Model for risk calculation and reliability comparison of level crossings,"There is not a single country in the world that is so rich that it can remove all level crossings or provide their denivelation in order to absolutely avoid the possibility of accidents at the intersections of railways and road traffic. In the Republic of Serbia alone, the largest number of accidents occur at passive crossings, which make up three-quarters of the total number of crossings. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly find solutions to the problem of priorities when choosing level crossings where it is necessary to raise the level of security, primarily by analyzing the risk and reliability at all level crossings. This paper presents a model that enables this. The calculation of the maximal risk of a level crossing is achieved under the conditions of generating the maximum entropy in the virtual operating mode. The basis of the model is a heterogeneous queuing system. Maximum entropy is based on the mandatory application of an exponential distribution. The system is Markovian and is solved by a standard analytical concept. The basic input parameters for the calculation of the maximal risk are the geometric characteristics of the level crossing and the intensities and structure of the flows of road and railway vehicles. The real risk is based on statistical records of accidents and flow intensities. The exact reliability of the level crossing is calculated from the ratio of real and maximal risk, which enables their further comparison in order to raise the level of safety, and that is the basic idea of this paper. © 2021 by the authors.

779,Privacy-Preserving Flexible Access Control for Encrypted Data in Internet of Things,"Along with the development of edge computing and the cloud, the Internet of Things (IoT) is affecting and changing people's lives. Data sharing has played an important role in the IoT, but the leakage of private user information poses a new security threat to the users. Thus, flexible fine-grained access control for such shared data is proposed in this article as an effective and secure method of eliminating vulnerabilities. However, the disclosure of access policies will also expose users' private information. Recently, Yang et al. attempted to solve this problem and proposed a framework based on attribute-based encryption for shared data onto IEEE IoT-J(DOI: 10.1109/JIOT.2016.2571718). They hide the access policies by using a bloom filter (BF) and attempt to address privacy preservation in IoT. However, we demonstrate several security weaknesses of their framework and point out its vulnerability to dictionary attacks and access policy guessing attacks. Then, an improved IoT solution is proposed. Under this proposal, the attribute values are stored in BF while the attribute names are embedded in the access policy. The proposed scheme can resist dictionary attacks and access policy guessing attacks. In addition, it simultaneously realizes large attribute sets, an efficient decryption algorithm, and adaptive security. Security analysis and performance evaluations show that the presented scheme achieves higher security and implementation simplicity in the IoT than other currently available schemes.  © 2014 IEEE."
780,Identity-based outsider anonymous cloud data outsourcing with simultaneous individual transmission for IoT environment,"The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing has become an attractive cloud-oriented big data processing paradigm, which is playing an important role in efficiency and productivity for digitalization of numerous IoT enabled industries. However, cloud-assisted IoT is also becoming an increasingly attractive target for various cyber-attacks, including the authenticity of outsourcing data, untrustworthiness of third parties, and data security and privacy. As a potential and promising solution to securely outsource data, we present the first construction for an efficient cloud data outsourcing system with simultaneous individual transmission preserving outsider anonymity of the subscribed consumer set. In our system, a data owner generates personalized data for each of the consumers in a group and transmits a common encrypted data for the group in such a way that the subscribed consumer set is completely hidden from the outsiders. Personalized data can be recovered only by an authorized consumer, while the common data can be decrypted by all the authorized consumer in that group. The communication bandwidth is compact in our construction, and the decryption algorithm requires significantly less computation cost. We design our scheme using asymmetric bilinear map over the prime order group to prevent fault attacks on symmetric bilinear map. Our construction is built in identity-based setting without any non-standard q-type security assumption and does not use random oracles. Our scheme enjoys adaptive security against an indistinguishable chosen-plaintext attack under the hardness of the standard decisional bilinear Diffie–Hellman exponent problem. Furthermore, our design supports an exponential number of consumers as the size of the valid identity set grows exponentially with the security parameter, whereas it is only polynomial in the security parameter for the existing cloud data outsourcing systems. In particular, the implementation and performance analysis explicates the advantages of our design for resource-constrained IoT enabled frameworks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
787,A data-driven approach to anomaly detection and vulnerability dynamic analysis for large-scale integrated energy systems,"In an integrated energy system (IES), the operating state of each energy subsystem changes relatively frequently, which can seriously threaten the security of IES operation. A systematic data-driven approach is proposed for detecting anomalies and analyzing the dynamics of IES vulnerability. Firstly, an anomaly detection method is introduced to determine whether there are anomalies in the system operation. The method can be set up even if the data labels for discriminating the anomalies are unknown, often the cause in practice. Secondly, a method of complex network phase theory is proposed to model information propagation among IES nodes representative of the IES physical entities. Complex network models can then be constructed to describe the system behavior in different operating conditions and over different time horizons. The degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality are used as indications to analyze changes in IES vulnerability. Finally, a method is proposed to identify the critical points of the IES from the point of view of its vulnerability. The new approach is applied to analyze the vulnerability of an IES in Spain. The results show that the proposed methods allow revealing system anomalies, vulnerability and weaknesses. Outcomes from an analysis by these methods can be used by managers to take defensive measures in advance for preventing and mitigating the impact of potential factors and threats on the IES. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
809,A Hierarchical Modeling Approach for Evaluating Availability of Dynamic Networks Considering Hardening Options,"Modern networks are dynamic with configuration changes that introduces a set of challenge to the network administrator in terms of security and availability. Here, the major challenge faced by the administrator is the increasing number of vulnerabilities with the uncertainties related to defense deployment options and how these options affect the network availability over time. This work proposes a hierarchical model-based approach to evaluate the availability of dynamic networks considering the deployment of different hardening options. In particular, this work adopts reliability block diagrams and Petri nets to represent and analyze dynamic network environments and evaluate their availability. A case study is presented to demonstrate the feasibility, usefulness, and scalability of the proposed approach for computing the availability of dynamic networks considering different hardening options. The proposed approach can be helpful for network administrators who are in charge of choosing the best hardening options taking into account the impacts on availability.  © 2021 IEEE."
811,Adaptive Security via Deletion in Attribute-Based Encryption: Solutions from Search Assumptions in Bilinear Groups,"One of the primary research challenges in Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is constructing and proving cryptosystems that are adaptively secure. To date the main paradigm for achieving adaptive security in ABE is dual system encryption. However, almost all such solutions in bilinear groups rely on (variants of) either the subgroup decision problem over composite order groups or the decision linear assumption. Both of these assumptions are decisional rather than search assumptions and the target of the assumption is a source or bilinear group element. This is in contrast to earlier selectively secure ABE systems which can be proven secure from either the decisional or search Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption. In this work we make progress on closing this gap by giving a new ABE construction for the subset functionality and prove security under the Search Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption. We first provide a framework for proving adaptive security in Attribute-Based Encryption systems. We introduce a concept of ABE with deletable attributes where any party can take a ciphertext encrypted under the attribute string x∈ { 0, 1 }n and modify it into a ciphertext encrypted under any string x′∈ { 0, 1, ⊥}n where x′ is derived by replacing any bits of x with ⊥ symbols (i.e. “deleting” attributes of x). The semantics of the system are that any private key for a circuit C can be used to decrypt a ciphertext associated with x′ if none of the input bits read by circuit C are ⊥ symbols and C(x′) = 1. We show a pathway for combining ABE with deletable attributes with constrained pseudorandom functions to obtain adaptively secure ABE building upon the recent work of Tsabary [30]. Our new ABE system will be adaptively secure and be a ciphertext-policy ABE that supports the same functionality as the underlying constrained PRF as long as the PRF is “deletion conforming”. Here we also provide a simple constrained PRF construction that gives subset functionality. Our approach enables us to access a broader array of Attribute-Based Encryption schemes support deletion of attributes. For example, we show that both the Goyal et al. (GPSW) [19] and Boyen [6] ABE schemes can trivially handle a deletion operation. And, by using a hardcore bit variant of GPSW scheme we obtain an adaptively secure ABE scheme under the Search Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in addition to pseudo random functions in NC1. This gives the first adaptively secure ABE from a search assumption as all prior work relied on decision assumptions over source group elements. © 2021, International Association for Cryptologic Research."
813,Standards for the artificial intelligence community,"Artificial intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) applications are widely available for different domains such as commercial, industrial, and intelligence applications. In particular, the use of AI applications for the security environment requires standards to manage expectations for users to understand how the results were derived. A reliance on ""black boxes""to generate predictions and inform decisions could lead to errors of analysis. This paper explores the development of potential standards designed for each stage of the development of an AI/ML system to help enable trust, transparency, and explainability. Specifically, the paper utilizes the standards outlined in Intelligence Community Directive 203 (Analytic Standards) to hold machine outputs to the same rigorous accountability standards as performed by humans. Building on the ICD203, the Multi-Source AI Scorecard Table (MAST) was developed to support the community towards test and evaluation of AI/ML techniques. The paper provides discussion towards using MAST to rate a semantic processing tool for processing noisy, unstructured, and complex microtext in the form of streaming chat for video call outs. The scoring is notional, but provides a discussion on how MAST could be used as a standard to compare AI/ML methods that complements datasheets and model cards.  © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

817,A design of multi-element anti-jamming gps antenna,"Background: With the development of the application of GPS satellite, the requirement of anti-jamming and integration for navigation receiving terminal is gradually raised. In terms of anti-jamming performance, because the satellite signal arrives at the ground with weak intensity and is vulnerable to electromagnetic interference, the positioning results are not available. Objective: Therefore, in complex electromagnetic environment, the anti-jamming navigation receiving terminal is needed, and the interference nulling or beam pointing can be achieved by using mul-ti-element antenna array with anti-jamming algorithm. Methods: Accordingly to requirements, the development trend of navigation receiving terminal is from single mode to multi-mode and miniaturization. A miniaturized 7-element anti-jamming antenna array is proposed. It mainly aims at GPS L1 and L2 frequency points. All elements adopt ce-ramic substrate microstrip antenna. The array elements adopt laminated design to effectively reduce the antenna aperture. The spacing between elements at two frequency points is not greater than half wavelength, which can ensure the back-end anti-jamming algorithm performance, and its performance and characteristics are verified through related experiments and simulations. Results: Anti-jamming algorithm performance, and its performance and characteristics are verified through related experiments and simulations. Conclusion: The designed multi-element antenna can be used in the anti-jamming application. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers."

858,Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in IoT Systems for Smart Cities,"Anomaly detection is critical in the Internet of Things (IoT) systems due to its wide applications for building smart cities, such as quality control in manufacturing, intrusion detection in system security, fault detection in system monitoring. Many existing schemes are problem specific and supervised approaches, which require domain knowledge and tremendous data labeling efforts. In this paper, we investigate unsupervised anomaly detection on multidimensional time series data in IoT systems, and develops a GRU-based Gaussian Mixture VAE scheme, called GGM-VAE. In particular, we employ Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells to discover the correlations among time series data, and use Gaussian Mixture priors in the latent space to characterize the multimodal data. Several previous works assume simple distributions for Gaussian Mixture priors, resulting in insufficient ability to fully capture the data patterns. To overcome this issue, we design a model selection mechanism during the training process under the guidance of Bayesian Inference Criterion (BIC) to find the model which can well estimate the distribution in the Gaussian Mixture latent space. We conduct extensive simulations on four datasets and observe that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection schemes and achieves up to 47.88% improvement in F1 scores on average. © 2013 IEEE."
859,Agent-based approach to the design of a multimodal interface for cyber-security event visualisation control,"Convenient human-computer interaction is essential to carry out many exhausting and concentration-demanding activities. One of them is cyber-situational awareness as well as dynamic and static risk analysis. A specific design method for a multimodal human-computer interface (HCI) for cyber-security events visualisation control is presented. The main role of the interface is to support security analysts and network operators in their monitoring activities. The proposed method of designing HCIs is adapted from the methodology of robot control system design. Both kinds of systems act by acquiring information from the environment, and utilise it to drive the devices influencing the environment. In the case of robots the environment is purely physical, while in the case of HCIs it encompasses both the physical ambience and part of the cyber-space. The goal of the designed system is to efficiently support a human operator in the presentation of cyberspace events such as incidents or cyber-attacks. Especially manipulation of graphical information is necessary. As monitoring is a continuous and tiring activity, control of how the data is presented should be exerted in as natural and convenient way as possible.

The importance of biometric technology related to the various fields of security is also discussed through this paper. The biometric technology connected with smart systems helps in monitoring the human activities all over the world, thus providing a good security level. Biometrics acts as a major support to various fields of automobile security, Internet of Things (IOT) Security, health care security, workforce management of organization, government security, banking, and retail industry. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
922,A fully secure KP-ABE scheme on prime-order bilinear groups through selective techniques,"Key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) is the cryptographic primitive which enables fine grained access control while still providing end-to-end encryption. Although traditional encryption schemes can provide end-to-end encryption, users have to either share the same decryption keys or the data have to be stored in multiple instances which are encrypted with different keys. Both of these options are undesirable. However, KP-ABE can provide less key overhead compared to the traditional encryption schemes. While there are a lot of KP-ABE schemes, none of them simultaneously supports multiuse of attributes, adaptive security, monotone span programs, and static security assumption. Hence, we propose a fully secure KP-ABE scheme for monotone span programs in prime-order group. This scheme uses selective security proof techniques to obtain the requisite ingredients for full security proof. This strengthens the correlation between selective and full security models and enables the transition of the best qualities in selective security models to fully secure systems. The security proof is based on decisional linear assumption and three-party Diffie-Hellman assumption. © 2020 Isaac Amankona Obiri et al.

942,Proof of concept of a projection-based safety system for human-robot collaborative engine assembly,"In the past years human-robot collaboration has gained interest among industry and production environments. While there is interest towards the topic, there is a lack of industrially relevant cases utilizing novel methods and technologies. The feasibility of the implementation, worker safety and production efficiency are the key questions in the field. The aim of the proposed work is to provide a conceptual safety system for context-dependent, multi-modal communication in human-robot collaborative assembly, which will contribute to safety and efficiency of the collaboration. The approach we propose offers an addition to traditional interfaces like push buttons installed at fixed locations. We demonstrate an approach and corresponding technical implementation of the system with projected safety zones based on the dynamically updated depth map and a graphical user interface (GUI). The proposed interaction is a simplified two-way communication between human and the robot to allow both parties to notify each other, and for the human to coordinate the operations. © 2019 IEEE."
952,Adaptively secure anonymous identity-based broadcast encryption for data access control in cloud storage service,"Cloud computing is now a widespread and economical option when data owners need to outsource or share their data. Designing secure and efficient data access control mechanism is one of the most challenging issues in cloud storage service. Anonymous broadcast encryption is a promising solution for its advantages in the respects of computation cost and communication overload. We bring forward an efficient anonymous identity-based broadcast encryption construction combined its application to the data access control mechanism in cloud storage service. The lengths for public parameters, user private key and ciphertext in the proposed scheme are all constant. Compared with the existing schemes, in terms of encrypting and decrypting computation cost, the construction of our scheme is more efficient. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is proved to achieve adaptive security against chosen-ciphertext attack adversaries in the standard model. Therefore, the proposed scheme is feasible for the system of data access control in cloud storage service. © 2019 KSII."
958,Multimodal graph analysis of cyber attacks,"The limited information on the cyberattacks available in the unclassified regime, hardens standardizing the analysis. We address the problem of modeling and analyzing cyberattacks using a multimodal graph approach. We formulate the stages, actors, and outcomes of cyberattacks as a multimodal graph. Multimodal graph nodes include cyberattack victims, adversaries, autonomous systems, and the observed cyber events. In multimodal graphs, single-modality graphs are interconnected according to their interaction. We apply community and centrality analysis on the graph to obtain in-depth insights into the attack. In community analysis, we cluster those nodes that exhibit 'strong' inter-modal ties. We further use centrality to rank the nodes according to their importance. Classifying nodes according to centrality provides the progression of the attack from the attacker to the targeted nodes. We apply our methods to two popular case studies, namely GhostNet and Putter Panda and demonstrate a clear distinction in the attack stages. © 2019 SCS."
971,Network Risk Assessment Based on Improved MulVAL Framework and HMM,"With the increasingly extensive applications of the network, the security of internal network of enterprises is facing more and more threats from the outside world, which implies the importance to master the network risk assessment skills. In the big data era, there are various security protection techniques and different types of group data. Meanwhile, Online Social Networks (OSNs) and Social Internet of Things (SIoT) are becoming popular patterns of meeting people and keeping in touch with friends [2, 5]. However, risk assessment, as a bridge between security experts and network administrators, to some extent, whose accuracy can influence the judgment of administrators to the entire network state. In order to solve this problem, this essay proposes the improved MulVAL framework to optimize the risk assessment process by establishing the HMM model and the Bayesian model, which can improve the accuracy of the evaluation value. Firstly, behavior of the attacker is described in-depth by the attack graph generated through MulVAL. Then, with the quantitative evaluation conducted by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, the nodes on the attack path can will be evaluated and the value will be further evaluated by the Bayesian model. Finally, by establishing the hidden Markov model, the corresponding parameters can be defined and the most likely probabilistic state transition sequence can be calculated by using the Viterbi algorithm to deduce the attack intent with the highest possibility. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering."
1052,Generic architecture for interactive mobile simulation of parallel Devs models: A missile defense application,"Modeling and simulation (M&S) is a discipline oriented towards engineering and research, but it tends since the very last years to be used more and more by users and developers of mobile applications through cloud computing and web services. The M&S new tools involve mobile terminals (smartphone, tablet, etc.) exchanging data quantities increasingly important from sensors with an increasing transmission speed. This paper presents a generic approach (the DEVSimPy-mob mobile application) which aims to simulate models described with the DEVS formalism (Discrete EVent system Specification). DEVSimPy-mob communicates with a web REST (Representational State Transfer) server that delivers a set of web services dedicated to the simulation of DEVS models. A real case application stemming from Balistic Missile Defense simulations is presented to show how DEVSimPy-mob can be used to launch simulations from a mobile device, interact during the simulation process and visualize results. © 2017 IEEE."
1055,Ontology development for run-time safety management methodology in Smart Work Environments using ambient knowledge,"This paper presents the development of a decision support system for run-time safety management in Smart Work Environments (SWEs). Our approach consists of four main phases: (i) definition of the basic steps of a methodology for run-time safety management; (ii) development of an ontological knowledge-base of safety in work environments; (iii) definition of constraints on the ontology based on organizations’ safety protocols; (iv) communication of relevant information to each actor in the safety management team. We propose a generic ontological model of safety expertise, based on Occupational Safety and Health Regulations (OSHA), that is employed as Knowledge required in our safety management methodology based on the MAPE-K (Monitor–Analyze–Plan–Execute and Knowledge) loop. We present the RAMIRES (Risk-Adaptive Management in Resilient Environments with Security) tool, implementing this methodology. RAMIRES is developed as a dashboard, supporting the safety management team in understanding the risk and its consequences, and to support decision making in risk treatment. RAMIRES interacts with the SWE and the safety management team (actors) in order to: (i) communicate the risks and preventive strategies to actors; (ii) obtain more data about the observed areas to understand the risk and its consequences; and (iii) execute the automatic preventive strategies and support actors in the execution of human-operated preventive strategies. In this paper, we show the details on concepts designed in the safety ontology and illustrate how these concepts can be extended to provide an abstract model of a specific use case. Furthermore, we propose the definition of constraints on the ontology using logic-based rules. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed methodology regarding the resilience of the environment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."
1142,Embedded security system for multi-modal surveillance in a railway carriage,"Public transport security is one of the main priorities of the public authorities when fighting against crime and terrorism. In this context, there is a great demand for autonomous systems able to detect abnormal events such as violent acts aboard passenger cars and intrusions when the train is parked at the depot. To this end, we present an innovative approach which aims at providing efficient automatic event detection by fusing video and audio analytics and reducing the false alarm rate compared to classical stand-alone video detection. The multi-modal system is composed of two microphones and one camera and integrates onboard video and audio analytics and fusion capabilities. On the one hand, for detecting intrusion, the system relies on the fusion of ""unusual"" audio events detection with intrusion detections from video processing. The audio analysis consists in modeling the normal ambience and detecting deviation from the trained models during testing. This unsupervised approach is based on clustering of automatically extracted segments of acoustic features and statistical Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) modeling of each cluster. The intrusion detection is based on the three-dimensional (3D) detection and tracking of individuals in the videos. On the other hand, for violent events detection, the system fuses unsupervised and supervised audio algorithms with video event detection. The supervised audio technique detects specific events such as shouts. A GMM is used to catch the formant structure of a shout signal. Video analytics use an original approach for detecting aggressive motion by focusing on erratic motion patterns specific to violent events. As data with violent events is not easily available, a normality model with structured motions from non-violent videos is learned for one-class classification. A fusion algorithm based on Dempster-Shafer's theory analyses the asynchronous detection outputs and computes the degree of belief of each probable event. © 2015 SPIE."
1174,Hide-n-sense: Preserving privacy efficiently in wireless mhealth,"As healthcare in many countries faces an aging population and rising costs, mobile sensing technologies promise a new opportunity. Using mobile health (mHealth) sensing, which uses medical sensors to collect data about the patients, and mobile phones to act as a gateway between sensors and electronic health record systems, caregivers can continuously monitor the patients and deliver better care. Furthermore, individuals can become better engaged in monitoring and managing their own health. Although some work on mHealth sensing has addressed security, achieving strong privacy for low-power sensors remains a challenge. We make three contributions. First, we propose an mHealth sensing protocol that provides strong security and privacy properties at the link layer, with low energy overhead, suitable for low-power sensors. The protocol uses three novel techniques: adaptive security, to dynamically modify transmission overhead; MAC striping, to make forgery difficult even for small-sized Message Authentication Codes; and asymmetric resource requirements, in recognition of the limited resources in tiny mHealth sensors. Second, we demonstrate its feasibility by implementing a prototype on a Chronos wrist device, and evaluating it experimentally. Third, we provide a security, privacy, and energy analysis of our system. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."
1175,Applying of component system development in object methodology,"In the last three decades, the concept and implementation of component-based architectures have been promoted in software systems creation. Increasingly complex demands are placed on the software component systems, in particular relating to the dynamic properties. The emergence of such requirements has been gradually enforced by the practice of development and implementation of these systems, especially for information systems software. Just the information systems (robust IS) of different types require that target software meets their requirements. Among other things, we mean primarily the adaptive processes of different domains, high distributives due to the possibilities of the Internet 2.0, acceptance of high integrity of life domains (process, data and communications integrity), scalability, and flexible adaptation to process changes, a good context for external devices and transparent structure of the sub-process modules and architectural units. Of course, the target software of required qualities and the type robust cannot be a monolith. As commonly known, development of design toward information systems software has clearly come to the need for the software composition of completely autonomous, but cooperating architectural units that communicate with each other using messages of prescribed formats. Although for such units there were often used the so called subsystems and modules, see (Jac, Boo, Rumbo, 1998) and (Arlo, Neus, 2007), their abstraction being gradually enacted as the term component. In other words, the subsystems and modules are specific types of components. In (Kral, Žeml, 2000) and (Kral, Žeml, 2003) there are considered two types of target software of information systems. The first type - there are SWC (Software Components), composed of permanently available components, which are thought as services - Confederate software. The second type - SWA (Software Alliance), called semi Confederate, formed during the run-time of the software system and referred to as software alliance. In both of these mentioned publications there is delivered deep philosophy of relevant issues relating to SWC /SWA as creating copies of components (cloning), the establishment and destruction of components at software run-time (dynamic reconfiguration), cooperation of autonomous components, programmable management of components interface in depending on internal components functionality and customer requirements (functionality, security, versioning). Nevertheless, even today we can meet numerous cases of SWC /SWA existence, with a highly developed architecture that is accepting vast majority of these requests. On the other hand, in the development practice of component-based systems with a dynamic architecture (i.e. architecture with dynamic reconfiguration), and finally with a mobile architecture (i.e. architecture with dynamic component mobility) confirms the inadequacy of the design methods contained in UML 2.0. It proves especially the dissertation thesis (Rych, Weis, 2008). Software Engineering currently has two different approaches to systems SWC /SWA. The first approach is known as component-oriented software development CBD (Component based Development). According to (Szyper, 2002) that is a collection of CBD methodologies that are heavily focused on the setting up and software components re-usability within the architecture. Although CBD does not show high theoretical approach, nevertheless, it is classified under the general evolution of SDP (Software Development Process), see (Sommer, 2010) as one of its two dominant directions. From a structural point of view, a software system consists of self-contained, interoperable architectural units - components based on well-defined interfaces. Classical procedural objectoriented methodologies significantly do not use the component meta-models, based on which the target component systems are formed, then. Component meta-models describe the syntax, semantics of components. They are a system of rules for components, connectors and configuration. Component meta-models for dynamic and mobile architectures also describe the concept of rules for configuration changes (rules for reconfiguration). As well-known meta-models are now considered: Wright for static architecture, SOFA and Darvin for dynamic architecture and SOFA 2.0 for mobile architecture, see (Rych, Weis, 2008). The CBD approach verbally defines the basic terms as component (primitive /composite), interface, component system, configuration, reconfiguration, logical (structural) view, process view (behavioral), static component architecture, dynamic architecture, mobile architecture (fully dynamic architecture), see (IEEE Report, 2000) and (Crnk, Chaud, 2006). The CBD approach also presents several ADL languages (Architecture Description Languages) which are able to describe software architecture. The known languages are integration ACME and UML (Unified Modeling Language), see (Garl, Mon, Wil, 2000) and (UNIFEM, 2005). The second approach to SWC /SWA systems is formed on SOA, but this article does not deal with it consistently. SOA is a philosophy of architecture. SOA is not a methodology for the comprehensive development of the target software. Nevertheless, SOA successfully filled the role of software design philosophy and on the other hand, also gave an important concept linking software components and their architectural units - business services. SOA understands any software as a Component System of a business service and solved life components in it. The physical implementation of components is given by a Web services platform. A certain lack of SOA is its weak link to the business processes that are a universally recognized platform for business activities and the source for the creation of enterprise services. This paper deals with a specific activity in the CBD, i.e. the integration of the concept of componentbased system into an advanced procedural, object-oriented methodology (Arlo, Neust, 2007), (Kan, Muller, 2005), ( Krutch, 2003) for problem domains with double-layer process logic. There is indicated an integration method, based on a certain meta-model (Applying of the Component system Development in object Methodology) and leading to the component system formation. The mentioned meta-model is divided into partial workflows that are located in different stages of a classic object process-based methodology. Into account there are taken the consistency of the input and output artifacts in working practices of the meta-model and mentioned object methodology. This paper focuses on static component systems that are starting to explore dynamic and mobile component systems. In addition, in the contribution the component system is understood as a specific system, for its system properties and basic terms notation being used a set and graph and system algebra."
1192,Multi-Modal Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems to Improve Safety,"Population increases globally have put considerable strain on transport infrastructure and transport management resulting in large social, environmental and economic costs. Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), can help focus on problems associated with traffic management, infrastructure management and security, as well as enhanced driver safety and logistics support for transport operations. It will improve drivers’ commutes, provide better information to city planners, increase the productivity of businesses and raise citizens’ quality of life, reduce congestion, shrink fuel use and cut CO2 emissions. This paper presents a multi-modal Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems based solution that has been designed as a more efficient and effective approach to prevent and potentially eliminate collisions at rail/road crossings. Large scale field trials of the system at level crossing interfaces have produced promising outcomes is a major step towards improving safety at level crossings. © 2013, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

This system must be able to acquire information about the environment, space, time, equipment, hardware, and software. This information is used in the user behavior analysis. This work proposes that, based on the evidence of the user behavior, it is possible to trust or not trust the user. Levels of trust are released according to the user behavior and the rules that were previously established for the parameters, which help to establish the evidences of behavioral trust, interacting with the environment information, so as to keep trust levels updated in a more accurate and faithful way. © 2012, IGI Global."

In this paper, we analyze security vulnerabilities of the WiBro standard, focusing on the initial authentication phase and propose a specification-based intrusion detection system that can detect those vulnerabilities. We first derive specifications from the normal operational process of the initial authentication based on PKMv2 EAP-AKA and formalize the derived specifications as a state transition diagram. The proposed system executes the intrusion detection based on those specifications and the state transition diagram. In this paper, to verify the detection capability of the proposed system, we construct an experimental network and execute scenario-based tests. © 2011 Springer-Verlag."
1246,Context-awareness handoff planning in heterogeneous wireless networks,"This paper addresses a context-awareness handoff planning mechanism in heterogeneous wireless networks for seamless ubiquitous access. The proliferation of digital devices with communication capability heralds the era of ubiquitous computing, as predicted by Mark Weiser. Mobile devices with multi-mode interfaces can access heterogeneous wireless networks, such as wireless local area network (WLAN), worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) network and third generation (3G) network. In heterogeneous wireless networks, different network provides different network capability, transmission range, data rate, access cost, security policy and quality of service. Therefore, a ubiquitous access aims to provide users intelligent human-centric context-aware handoff mechanism in heterogeneous wireless networks at anytime anywhere is gradually become an important issue. Optimal handoff planning in heterogeneous wireless networks considers the needs of users, accessing service and the surrounding context. However, most of existing handoff mechanisms only considered few contexts that lead to not able to select the most suitable network for individual user. In this paper, we propose a human-centric context-aware solution to access most appropriate network that satisfies individual user's requirement, fulfills seamless data transmission and reduces handoff delay. We develop two integrated approaches for context-awareness handoff planning mechanisms, namely MADM approach and GA approach. The MADM approach contains initial process and decision process. Initial process weights context by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method while decision process selects the most appropriate network by Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The GA approach uses Genetic Algorithm to minimize handoff under given QoS constraints. Performance of proposed mechanisms is evaluated under different services with different QoS considerations. Our simulation results show that both mechanisms are able to derive a proper network handoff plan which guarantees QoS requirements and reduces delay, jitter, and number of handoffs. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."

In this paper, a deep analysis about states transition path is studied, using Markov chain and conflict resolution technique. The concept of virtual player is introduced whose transition probability matrix is derived from individual player in conflict system. The average transition path is calculated to measure the cost for conflict resolution. Finally, a case study of public resource management strategy conflict is carried out to verify the proposed analysis approach. ©2009 IEEE."
1273,A RESTful approach to the management of cloud infrastructure,"Recently, REpresentational State Transfer (REST) has been proposed as an alternative architecture for Web services. In the era of Cloud and Web 2.0, many complex Web service-based systems such as e-Business and e-Government applications have adopted REST. Unfortunately, the REST approach has been applied to few cases in management systems, especially for a management system for cloud computing infrastructures. In this paper, we design and implement a RESTful Cloud Management System (CMS). Managed elements can be modelled as resources in REST and operations in existing systems can be evaluated using four methods of REST or a combination of them. We also show how components of existing management systems can be realized as REST-style Web services. © 2009 IEEE."

1351,Software rejuvenation approach to security engineering,"While traditional security mechanisms rely on preventive controls and those are limited in surviving malicious attacks, we propose a novel approach to security engineering. The objective is to characterize the attacks in real time and survive in face of attacks by using software rejuvenation. In this paper we address the critical intrusion tolerance problems ahead of intrusion detection. Firstly, the attacks are characterized by applying Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and these characterized intrusions are analyzed according to their state changes by utilizing transient state analysis. Subsequently, the software rejuvenation methods are performed by killing the intruders' processes in their tracks, halting abuse before it happens, shutting down unauthorized connection, and responding and restarting in real time. These slogans will really frustrate and deter the attacks, as the attacker can't make their progress. This is a way of survivability to increase the deterrence level against an attack in the target environment. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004."
1363,Autonomic protection system using adaptive security policy,"There are various techniques to safeguard computer systems and networks against illegal actions. Secure OS based on Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the systems that reflect these techniques. The RBAC system controls access to system resources based on roles. Recently, many systems employ more fine-grained access control on system resources to enhance system security. However, this approach in access control level may cause unexpected problems, since most systems acquire system resources through system call that is hooked on kernel. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The proposed Autonomic Protection System (APS) supports fine-grained intrusion detection. It resides above Secure OS based on RBAC that provides general-grained access control. The system detects intrusions using security policy based on RBAC model. The system performs double checking for intrusions using positive and negative intrusion detection policy. Additionally, as one of active responses, the system supports the self-adaptation of security policy depending on various computing environments. Therefore, the system can detect intrusions more accurately and respond to the attacks actively and appropriately. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004."

1366,A composable framework for secure multi-modal access to Internet services from post-PC devices,"The post-PC revolution is bringing information access to a wide-range of devices beyond the desktop, such as public kiosks, and mobile devices like cellular telephones, PDAs, and voice based vehicle telematics. However existing deployed Internet services are geared toward the secure rich interface of private desktop computers. We propose the use of an infrastructure-based secure proxy architecture to bridge the gap between the capabilities of post-PC devices and the requirements of Internet services. By combining generic content and security transformation functions with service-specific rules, the architecture decouples device capabilities from service requirements and simplifies the addition of new devices and services. Security and protocol specifics are abstracted into reusable components. Additionally, the architecture offers the novel ability to deal with untrusted public Internet access points by providing fine-grain control over the content and functionality exposed to the end device, as well as support for using trusted and untrusted devices in tandem. Adding support for a deployed Internet service requires a few hundred lines of scraping scripts. Similarly, adding support for a new device requires a few hundred lines of stylesheets for the device format. The average latency added by proxy transformations is around three seconds in our unoptimized Java implementation. © 2000 IEEE."
1377,State in Haskell,"Some algorithms make critical internal use of updatable state, even though their external specification is purely functional. Based on earlier work on monads, we present a way of securely encapsulating stateful computations that manipulate multiple, named, mutable objects, in the context of a non-strict, purely-functional language. The security of the encapsulation is assured by the type system, using parametricity. The same framework is also used to handle input/output operations (state changes on the external world) and calls to C. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers."
1402,Blockchain based Secured Virtual Machine Image Monitor,"Blockchain technology supports data immutability. Whereas, smart contracts are piece of self-executable codes running inside the blockchain network, responsible for the transformation or state change of these data. Furthermore, Cloud Computing is used in the application of data storage and usage. Several business enterprises use cloud for hosting their applications and data with a minimized effort, cost and hurdles of maintenance. However, ensuring security of client data and proper management of the Service Provider's infrastructure remains a crucial issue. In this article, an Ethereum based blockchain network has been proposed that monitors and assures the safety of the VirtualMachine Images (VMI) stored at the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) end. The proposed scheme tends to design a dedicated Smart Contract which handles each and every function, starting from request of a VMI by the Cloud Service Consumer (CSC) to the usage of the same by the later. The use of blockchain technology ensures that no single admin/third party can control/modify the system. This prevents unwanted modification of the VMIs by an intruder and guarantees the efficiency of the scheme to be higher than any other methodology designed for the same purpose till date."
1404,Taxonomy of Cyber Threats,"Cyber threats span the attack cycle, and include both offensive and defensive elements. Several conceptual models help with describing the attack process and associated entities, in developing a taxonomy of cyber threats. For Example, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) helps to describe a system to manage cyber security risk. In addition, the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) and the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) are used to standardize indicator information into a form that will make the data sharable. This helps to structure the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) information in order to use it in defensive approaches (e.g., DREAD: damage/reproducibility/exploitability/affected users/discoverability; STRIDE: spoofing/tampering/repudiation/information disclosure/denial of service/elevation of privilege; CVSS: Common Vulnerability Scoring System) along with more advanced approaches that emulate offensive steps. Sharing cyber data is performed by government agencies (e.g., US Department of Homeland Security) along with information analysis centers (e.g., Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center [MS-ISAC]). In addition to managing known threat data across an attack process, threat evaluation is performed via methodological evaluation of system-level vulnerabilities using model/architecture descriptions (e.g., system modeling language [SysML]) and rolling up developing threat descriptions through techniques like the US Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Analytics Repository (DoDCAR)."
1427,Multi-modal and multi-sensor approach to support security management tasks,"Recent changes in the dynamic characteristics of security and emergency management requirements have a big impact on the development of more effective security systems. Innovative solutions have to provide support for new security challenges and newly developed operational strategies. Widely used security concepts based on video sensor solutions are being replaced by high-performance multi-sensor systems, which allow monitoring of outdoor areas with various sizes independent of lighting and weather conditions. Apart from the sensors used, the system effectiveness depends on innovative automatic data analysis including AI methods to enable generation of a comprehensive near real-time representation of a given situation. This work describes a concept and an experimental prototype of a self-sufficient, independent multi-sensor system for monitoring of critical personal behavior in the context of events, border area surveillance and critical infrastructure monitoring. The specific security scenarios were defined and worked out in detail in close cooperation with security experts. In order to ensure 24/7 operational capability, the work focuses on a flexible sensor platform concept and includes optical, thermal and radar sensors which are synergistically employed. Furthermore, innovative approaches to multi-sensor AI-based data analysis and web-based mobile information management solutions were developed as part of the nationally funded research project WatchDog to enable a targeted, scenario oriented support of the security forces. © 2019 by the authors."
1433,Internet of things integration with cloud computing,"Internet of Things is also known as Systems of Systems. It is an integration of unlimited number of constituent systems with the help of networking and operating remotely with the help of Cloud Computed assisted environment. Internet of Things is a rapidly growing paradigm to operate distinct machines from remotely by the users to perform the distinct operations for a specific period of time. IoT has already crossed the number of machines operated remotely by the users more than 20 billion embedded machines. The advent of IoT has changed the operational mode of the systems with remote operations with extended and unlimited facilities in managing the things remotely. The main components of IoT can be distinguished as the communication, sensing Nodes and Embedded processing. Machine to Machine communication has developed and come into force to manage infinite number of machines processed with embedded configurations and managed with sensing nodes through internet communications. In addition to that the cloud computing assistance has given rise to the efficiency of the operations remotely with the help of User Interface technologies. When the number of things is more in management and controlling remotely the security implementations have played vital role in the combination of security architecture with service layer to perform more efficiently the device discovery and devices management. Similarly, the Human to Machine interactions are also done with the help of Internet of Things. In this paper we explore the importance of IoT aided cloud computing security architecture and service layers to manage infinite number of machines remotely.

1443,A prototype development of a declarative approach for computer system security,"In information security, representation and reasoning of authorization policy has been a key research topic in this field especially in a sophisticated information sharing and exchange environment [6, 7, 9]. In such a scenario, an user's request to access the system may not be able to decide straightaway, it may initiate a sequence of complex executions of authorization commands in order to determine either to grant or deny such a request. Becker and Nanz's logic of State-Modifying Policies (SMP) is a formal system addressing such problem in access control. In this paper, we provide a declarative semantics for SMP through a translation from SMP to Answer Set Programming (ASP) and propose a system prototype to implement our approach. Our experimental results show that our ASP implementation for SMP reasoning is effective to deal with real world problem domains. Copyright ISCA, CAINE 2016."
1451,Reliability and security analysis on 3-vote-2 voting system,"To aim at 3-vote-2 voting system which had already been widely applied in modern railway signal system, based on Markov model the paper analyzed its security and reliability indexes respectively under the three operating modes. During modeling some significant factors, such as common-cause failure, coverage rate of diagnostic systems, online maintainability, periodic inspection, and diverse failure modes, not only were considered, but also according to practical applications, the three types of Markov models were established for 3-vote-2 voting system with diversity version software on condition that secondary degradation was allowed, and secondary degradation was not allowed, and as well as not only secondary degradation was not allowed but also primary degradation was not be allowed too, that is 2oo2 model operating. They were respectively defined as Mode I, and Mode II, and Mode III. Based on the Markov models, the reliability and security indexes of the three modes were worked out. Compared with 3-vote-2 voting system with single version software, the results showed that the influence of diversity software versions on 3-vote-2 voting system security was unapparent, but quite dramatic for its reliability. In addition, the impacts on system reliability and security were unapparent whether considering secondary degradation or not, and the results tended to be conservative and the system was easy to realize while not considering secondary degradation. In the end, the investigations still showed that the impacts on system security performance were not very large, but relatively larger on system reliability under the Mode III, and the results tended more conservative and the system was easier to realize. Hence, after comprehensive consideration on reliability, and security, and as well as easy realization factor, we consider that the Mode III possesses better performance presentation, and is an ideal realization scheme for 3-vote-2 voting system."
1454,The implementation of florida's TSM&O,"The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) has committed to manage and operate its entire multi-modal transportation system efficiently and effectively. Transportation funding remains limited and must be carefully allocated to meet agency objectives regarding safety, mobility, commerce, and environmental preservation through Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSM&O). The integrated program aims to optimize the performance of existing multi-modal infrastructure through implementation of systems, services, and projects to preserve capacity and improve the security, safety, and reliability of Florida's transportation system. The formal adoption of TSM&O created the program's foundation. As a decentralized agency FDOT is organized into a Central Office in Tallahassee that creates policy and procedure, and eight local Districts that plan and operate their systems. Immediate first steps included creation of leadership and task teams whose participants reflected Florida's diversity in population, geography, and demographics that would then guide and implement TSM&O actions."
1475,COSMO-SkyMed mission: First results and future outlook,"Since 2007 Italian Space Agency (ASI) launched three out of four X-band SAR satellites of the COnstellation of small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) Mission, making available to the users a unique SAR constellation dedicated to the Earth Observation. COSMO-SkyMed is the largest Italian investment in Space Systems for Earth Observation, commissioned and funded by ASI and Italian Ministry of Defense (MoD). COSMO-SkyMed is a Dual-Use (Civilian and Defence) end-to-end Earth Observation System aimed to establish a global service supplying provision of data, products and services relevant to a wide range of applications, especially in the field of Risk Management for both Scientific/Commercial and Defence/Intelligence use. The system consists of a constellation of four Low Earth Orbit mid-sized satellites, each equipped with a multi-mode high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) operating at X-band. The high resolution imaging and time performances, make of COSMO-SkyMed a unique system that already showed all its potentiality in several application domains such as risk and emergency management, multitemporal acquisition for agriculture monitoring, ship detection, interferometry, landslides monitoring, maritime surveillance and security, rapid mapping. The constellation will be completed with the launch of the forth satellites in 2010."
1497,Security modeling on the supply chain networks,"In a typical supply chain network, a purchaser is a manufacturer or a retail distributor. In order to keep the cost down, a purchaser tends to send out the request for quotation for a group of potential suppliers. The purchaser will choose a supplier with the best combination of price and quality. Sometimes a potential supplier will try to collect the information about other suppliers so he/she can provide the best bid to the purchaser. Since most transactions are done through a computer network system such as Extranet or Internet, the confidentiality becomes very important between suppliers and the purchaser. The Bell-LaPadula model is one of security models for information confidentiality and has been adopted by military for a long time. Chen et. al. has proposed the application of Bell-LaPadula model in the design of supply chain network. In the Bell-Lapadula model a subject can be in one of different security clearance and an object can be in one of various security classifications. This paper attempts to model the security on the supply chain networks using Markov chain by combining subjects and objects as its states to simulate the security state transitions."
1500,Additional security requirements to integrate wireless networks,"Wireless networks have become more important in the last few months. The low initial costs for hardware and the use of mobile equipment (Notebook, PDA) increase the acceptance. The access to the wireless network - not only from inside a building - increases the security risk. Thus, the wireless network must be protected. With the implemented mechanisms (e.g. WEP) a secure connection is not guaranteed. The established mechanisms are insecure. This may be solved by the IEEE 802.11i standard. All components (wireless cards, access points) must support this standard for adaptive security. For a successful integration of a network-wide security concept, all systems must be considered. They must be as secure as possible for such a realization. A VPN connection among wireless systems and the local network is one solution. A concept for general security - analogous to intrusion detection systems (IDS) - can be implemented under this condition. This paper describes these additional requirements to secure a wireless network in combination with a usual local network."
1504,A context-based approach of security policies,"The wide adoption of handled devices and remote services arises a number of security problems for users and services providers. The ubiquitous (pervasive) nature of such applications has brought new security vulnerabilities, and security in pervasive computing is thus, still a hot topic. Context-based security is an emerging approach for modeling adaptive security solutions based on the context of use of the system. Our contribution aims at presenting a new model for specifying context-based security levels. This approach is based on contextual graphs and relies on a set of contextual information collected from the system and user's environments."
1506,Security of current mobile IP solutions,"Due to the operation of IP' s addressing and routing algorithms, mobile nodes (such as notebooks, portable workstations and palmtop computers) cannot currently participate, while roaming without being reconfigured, in tactical wired and wireless networks, strategic networks or the Internet. A node's IP address encodes the network access point to which the node is connected. This prevents IP packets from reaching the node if it moves to a new location and tries to connect to its home network from within a different network. Changing the IP address of a node when it moves is not possible while keeping existing transport level connections open. This change requires the termination of all current network activity and the user making a number of configuration changes followed by rebooting of the Node. There are a number of proposed solutions for supporting mobile nodes (leading approaches are: Mobility Support in IPv4 [Perkins96-1], Route Optimized Mobile IP for IPv4 [Johnson96-1], and Mobility Support in IPv6 [Johnson96-2]) that are compatible with the TCP/IP protocol suite. This paper addresses the security needs for IP mobile hosts in the tactical battlefield, the security capabilities and deficiencies of these solutions, and proposed solutions for identified security deficiencies."
