1,An integrated state transition-Boolean logic model for security analysis in cloud computing,"The hype over cloud computing cannot go unnoticed even as providers and users alike testify of the evident benefits. It also goes without saying that this approach to computing shares its own challenges the most echoed being security. Security concerns herein, birthed by the exposure of the cloud to different threats, continue to cast doubts on potential users and it's only befitting that such concerns are addressed. Users who entrust their data to the cloud want their data to be secured in the strongest terms possible. Once data leaves the user, the onus is on the cloud provider to provide the required security since data now lies within their perimeter of jurisdiction. But security requirements do change with time and this therefore calls for a continuous process of evaluating the security status of the cloud system. This paper proposes a model of analyzing the security status of the cloud system with regards confidentiality, integrity and availability. We employ state transitions of a conceptual finite state machine, Boolean algebra and logic to evaluate the various states of the system when a specified breach occurs. The scope of this paper is limited to user data on the cloud and not as it traverses the network between the user and the provider."
20,Rapid Security Situation Prediction of Smart Grid Based on Markov Chain,"Based on Markov chain analysis method, the situation prediction of smart grid security and stability can be judged in this paper. First component state transition probability matrix and component state prediction were defined. A fast derivation method of Markov state transition probability matrix using in system state prediction was proposed. The Matlab program using this method was compiled to analyze and obtain the future state probability distribution of grid system. As a comparison the system state distribution was simulated based on sequential Monte Carlo method, which was in good agreement with the state transition matrix, and the validity of the method was verified. Furthermore, the situation prediction of the six-node example was analyzed, which provided an effective prediction and analysis tool for the security situation."
24,Software defined network: Future of networking,"The digital world we live in has been lead by the evolution of Internet, which has created revolution. Today almost everything is connected and accessible from anywhere, everywhere. Unfortunately, the traditional IP network system is still complex, not easily manageable and difficult to reconfigure in case of any change or fault. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm separates the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting logical centralization of network control and introducing the ability to program the network. It has become the focus in the current information and communication technology area because of its flexibility and programmability. SDN abstracts low-level network functionalities to simplify network management. The OpenFlow protocol implements the SDN concept by abstracting network elements. It offers flexible and scalable functionality for network by decoupling the network control from forwarding devices. SDN uses a REST API (Representational State Transfer) for communication between controller and another application."
38,State Based Network Isolation for Critical Infrastructure Systems Security,"The collision of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) networks has resulted in some significant security challenges. Cyber attacks are now taking place against critical infrastructures and the nature of industrial automation control systems equipment in OT networks makes traditional IT security measures more difficult if not impossible to employ. A new method of system isolation based on system state vice network traffic restrictions is presented as a means to protect critical systems from conventional IT based attacks. This new method of protection functions by isolating systems from the network, yet moving data in form of state transfer vice network message. This method improves reliability and provides a means of protection from most current IT based attack vectors."
73,Towards a Framework for Safe and Secure Adaptive Collaborative Systems,"Real-time adaptive systems are complex systems capable to adapt their behavior to changing conditions in the environment, and/or internal state changes. Highly dynamic and possibly unpredictable environments, and uncertain operating conditions call for new paradigms of software design, and run-time adaptation mechanisms, to overcome the lack of knowledge at design time. Main application areas include vehicles or robots that need to collaborate to achieve a common task, e.g., minimize fuel consumption, moving objects at a construction site, or performing a set of operations in a factory. Moreover, these vehicles or robots need to interact and possibly collaborate with humans in a safe way, e.g., avoiding accidents or collisions, and prevent hazardous situations that may harm humans and/or machines. % This paper proposes a framework for developing safe and secure adaptive collaborative systems, with run-time guarantees. To enable this, our focus is on requirement engineering and safety assurance techniques to capture the specific safety and security properties for the collaborative system, and to provide an assurance case guaranteeing that the system is sufficiently safe. Moreover, the paper proposes an architecture and behavioral models to analyze the requirements at run-time. Finally, we design a suitable deployment platform to perform the run-time analysis and planning while guaranteeing the real-time constraints."
79,Securing APIs and Chaos Engineering,"Suppose information security starts to embrace the reality that failure will happen. In that case, we can move from trying to build the perfectly secure system to continue asking questions like “how much vulnerability do I have and what control do I need to be effective?” This paper proposes Security Chaos Engineering as a method to expose API vulnerabilities and enhance API security. RESTful API has gained popularity in recent years due to its reusability, flexibility and natural adaptation to modern web application, mobile application, and cloud computing. However, ensuring secure API/data access and hence mitigating reputational and/or financial damage to the organization is still in its early stage. Foundational security protection mechanisms include transport layer security, authentication / authorization of the consumer (either individual or application). To complete the spectrum of secure API access and provide advanced protection, there is much more to consider: mitigation of API specific vulnerabilities at design and implementation time. API Security using Chaos Engineering is an approach for learning about system security behavers when using APIs by applying empirical exploration. Security Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting to build confidence in the system’s security and see how a system can withstand threats in production. Security Chaos Engineering isn’t about creating chaos. It is about making the security chaos inherent in the system visible."
92,Securing Designs of an Area Efficient BIST Technique in UART,"Proliferation drift of IC trade, many microchips are modeled in foundry. Presence of behaving-inbuilt hardware Trojans (HTs) is of very tight security concern, without the awareness of end users or original designers of host, to identify Trojans-free circuit. For this designer seeks low switching probability nets to insert HTs to reduce power leakage. But circuit's net experiences distinct state and switching probabilities on test and function mode. Proposed method, fast heuristic, is actuated on circuit under test (CUT). This is minimal complex, high accurate, popular standard and complex circuit tested with reasonable delay. In hardware self-testing, (built in self test) offer worthy solution to reduces product failure, complexity occurs in proliferation. Design and actuation of universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART), to reduce power, area, to reach portable, stable and reliable data transmission is employed."
98,Multi-mode and distributed model predictive control for whole day train regulation,"To further improve the operation efficiency of metro trains, a multi-mode and distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm is proposed for whole day train regulation of metro transportation in presence of time-varying passenger arrival rate and disturbances. Firstly, a multi-mode switching train operation model in a metro line is built with a switched linear function describing dynamic passenger demand. Secondly, a DMPC-based strategy for train regulation is proposed to ensure the punctuality and security of whole day train operation. Furthermore, numerical examples are present and the progress and practicability of the proposed train regulation strategy are illustrated, revealing that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the computation time so as to improve the real-time regulation performance."
124,A Low-Cost Fault Injection Attack Resilient FSM Design,"Finite state machine (FSM) plays an important role in digital circuit design. Since it stores the system states and controls system functionality, security vulnerabilities of FSM have been exploited extensively. Among the potential attacks, fault inject attack (FIA) is one of the most severe and most challenging to defend against. Unlike existing countermeasures, we propose a novel structure for FSM state flip flop design that can mitigate any kind of timing based FIAs. Our key idea is to sample the flip flop input signals multiple times during one clock cycle, and then compare these values to determine the correct one. This can effectively defeat all the FIAs based on violating FSM state setup time constraint. In addition, such design will make the design more robust against jitters. In order to reduce the design overhead, we use the low-cost transmission gates to implement the proposed latch and flip flop. We use Hspice to simulate the error conditions with delayed input data and jitter and the results confirm that our design is error resilient. We also implement the FSM in AES with our proposed flip flops and compare the area overhead with existing FIA countermeasures. Results show that the two state-of-the-art approaches have 2X and 4X area overhead than ours."
138,Toward the Web of Things: Applying Web Technologies to the Physical World,"Just as Internet connectivity has enabled intuitive information sharing and interaction through the Web, so the Internet of Things might be the basis for the Web of Things, enabling equally simple interaction among devices, systems, users, and applications."
146,Attack Detection and Mitigation for Sensor and CAN Bus Attacks in Vehicle Anti-lock Braking Systems,"For a modern vehicle, if a sensor in the vehicle Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) or the controller area network (CAN) bus is attacked during a brake process, the vehicle will lose driving direction control and driver's life will be highly threatened. However, current methods for detecting attacks are not sufficiently accurate and no methods can provide attack mitigation. To ensure vehicle ABS security, we propose an attack detection method to accurately detect both sensor attack and CAN bus attack in a vehicle ABS, and an attack mitigation strategy to mitigate their negative effects on the vehicle ABS. In our attack detection method, we build a vehicle state space equation which considers real-time road friction coefficient to predict vehicle states (i.e., wheel speed and longitudinal brake force) with their previous values. Based on sets of historical measured vehicle states, we develop a search algorithm to find out attack changes (vehicle state changes because of the attack) by minimizing errors between predicted vehicle states and measured vehicle states. In our attack mitigation strategy, attack changes are subtracted from measured vehicle states to generate correct vehicle states for the vehicle ABS. We conducted first real sensor attack experiments to show how a magnet affects sensor readings. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack detection method can detect sensor attack and CAN bus attack more accurately compared with existing methods, and also our attack mitigation strategy almost eliminates attack's effects on the vehicle ABS."
148,N-variant IC design: Methodology and applications,"We propose the first method for designing N-variant sequential circuits. The flexibility provided by the N-variants enables a number of important tasks, including IP protection, IP metering, security, design optimization, self-adaptation and fault-tolerance. The method is based on extending the finite state machine (FSM) of the design to include multiple variants of the same design specification. The state transitions are managed by added signals that may come from various triggers depending on the target application. We devise an algorithm for implementing the N-variant IC design. We discuss the necessary manipulations of the added signals that would facilitate the various tasks. The key advantage to integrating the heterogeneity in the functional specification of the design is that we can configure the variants during or post-manufacturing, but removal, extraction or deletion of the variants is not viable. Experimental results on benchmark circuits demonstrate that the method can be automatically and efficiently implemented. Because of its lightweight, N-variant design is particularly well-suited for securing embedded systems. As a proof-of-concept, we implement the N-variant method for content protection in portable media players, e.g., iPod. We discuss how the N-variant design methodology readily enables new digital rights management methods."
149,Hybrid Bypass Protection of Hybrid Smart Transformers for Advanced Grid Support,"Due to the rapid transformation of traditional grid into a complex meshed network along with an exponential integration of volatile distributed energy resources (DERs); wind and photovoltaic (PV) farms, and converter-based loads; electric vehicles (EVs) etc., traditional grid operation strategies are stressed, and mitigation measures are required. Accordingly, a myriad of dynamic mitigation devices have been proposed in the last few decades where these devices are installed at strategic points in the grid. Transformer-less power electronics-based modules, integrated between the neutral and substation ground of traditional transformers, have been proposed introducing a variety of advanced grid mitigation and support features; DC elimination, voltage regulation, voltage and impedance balancing, harmonics isolation and power flow control. However, the protection of these series-connected modules against high voltage development during ground faults or inrush currents is critical as it could damage these converter-based mitigation devices or exceed the transformer BIL rating, thus, severely threatening the energy security. This paper presents an effective transformer and the module protection scheme utilizing a hybrid AC/DC solid-state switch. The proposed scheme is evaluated on an emulated 25-kVA, 7.2kV/240V single-phase hybrid smart transformer (HST), utilizing Typhoon HIL that verifies its promising performance."
179,Poster: Reasoning Based on Imperfect Context Data in Adaptive Security,Enabling software systems to adjust their protection in continuously changing environments with imperfect context information is a grand challenging problem. The issue of uncertain reasoning based on imperfect information has been overlooked in traditional logic programming with classical negation when applied to dynamic systems. This paper sketches a non-monotonic approach based on Answer Set Programming to reason with imperfect context data in adaptive security where there is little or no knowledge about certainty of the actions and events.
181,Steady state and dynamic security assessment in composite power systems,Security analysis is one of the important issues in power system reliability evaluation. A probabilistic method using sequential Monte Carlo simulation is introduced for modeling and integration of steady state and dynamic security assessment in computing the reliability indices. These system indices provide quantitative measures of the system operating states for use in short and long term planning. Case studies of the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) system and IEEE reliability test system (RTS) are described to demonstrate this approach.
185,Designing a Security Platform for Collaborating Autonomous Systems - An Experience Report,"Collaborative autonomous systems operating at edges, e.g., TurtleBots, need adaptive security mechanisms (i.e., Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) that meet the changing mission requirements and the available processing capacities. We have designed and implemented a security platform that supports secure communication among autonomous systems of robots (e.g., TurtleBots), security of Robot Operating System (ROS) communication network, the integrity of the information exchanged among the robots and secured availability of the data and access to services. For designing the security platform, we have used architecture and design patterns along with the respective security protocols. Our solution provides seamless security incorporation in heterogeneous collaborative autonomous entities. We have leveraged architectural strategies to incorporate publickey encryption, maintain global order of events and incorporate fault tolerance. We assert that the presented security platform can facilitate easy adoption of secure control, communication and information gathering in collaborative autonomous systems with resource constraint edge nodes."
188,A Novel Deep Reinforcement Learning Enabled Multi-Band PSS for Multi-Mode Oscillation Control,"To better damp out the multi-mode oscillations in an uncertain environment, a novel multi-band power system stabilizer (MBPSS) is proposed. Compared with other MBPSSs, the proposed controller has a well-balanced structure, and each band is designed to address a target low-frequency oscillation (LFO) mode. A deep reinforcement learning-enabled agent is developed to effectively tune the control parameters that are adaptive to system uncertainties and different operating conditions. Comparative results with other types of PSSs on the IEEE 68-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method has better performance of damping out LFO and robustness against unseen operating conditions and faults."
215,Adaptive information security and privacy,"Although security and privacy by design underpin effective engineering of software intensive systems, the dynamic reality of modern information systems means that such systems are the subject of changes of many different forms that can affect their operational environment, their behaviour, and the behaviour of their users, both legitimate and malicious. Systems must therefore be adaptive by design, in order to adapt effectively at runtime. In particular, these systems must be able to adapt their security and privacy controls, both proactively or in response to a variety of changes in their environment, in the threats they face, and in the assets they are required to protect. This talks presents both empirical and engineering challenges to achieving adaptive security and privacy in information systems. Acknowledging that information systems are increasingly both socio-technical and cyber-physical, the talk explores the impact of cyber-physical-social boundaries and their effective management when engineering secure, privacy-aware, and forensics-ready systems."
245,Security in Underwater Sensor Network,"Underwater wireless sensor network is a novel type of underwater networked system. Due to the characteristics of UWSN and underwater channel, UWSN are vulnerable to malicious attacks. The existing security solutions proposed for WSN cannot be used directly in UWSN. Moreover, most of these solutions are layer wise. In this paper, we studied the threat, attack, and security issues of UWSN. Subsequently, we argue that layered security schemes cannot protect UWSN against blended attacks. Additionally, we presented a novel preliminary conceive, which is a cross-layer, adaptive, selective security scheme."
263,Adaptive IEEE 802.11i Security for Energy-Security Optimization,"As computing devices and wireless connectivity become ubiquitous, the need for efficient secure wireless networks becomes a critical concern. Low power consumption is currently one of the major issues for all wireless application. Emerging wireless and mobile appliances are severely constrained in the resources they possess, namely, processor, battery, and memory. Energy consumed by computation and communication intensive wireless security protocols used to provide data privacy, integrity and authenticity is a function of the size of the data transferred and the security level of the session. In this paper we propose an adaptive security scheme for wireless networks to optimize battery energy consumption. We base our model on well-established simulation results and methodologies that leads to rigorous modularization for energy-conscious and energy-conserving wireless security design."
266,Automatic management of network security policy,"The paper describes work in our project funded by the DARPA Dynamic Coalitions program to design, develop, and demonstrate a system for automatically managing security policies in dynamic networks. Specifically, we aim to reduce human involvement in network management by building a practical network reconfiguration system so that simple security policies stated as positive and negative invariants are upheld as the network changes. The focus of this project is a practical tool to help systems administrators verifiably enforce simple multi-layer network security policies. Our key design considerations are computational cost of policy validation and the power of the enforcement primitives. The central component is a policy engine populated by models of network elements and services that validates policies and computes new configuration settings for network elements when they are violated. We instantiate our policy enforcement tool using a monitoring and instrumentation layer that reports network changes as they occur and implements configuration changes computed by the policy engine."
290,Integrated aviation security for defense-in-depth of next generation air transportation system,"To meet the significant increase in civil air traffic demand in the National Airspace System (NAS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is cooperating with other departments to develop Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). NextGen will greatly increase the NAS capacity, efficiency, safety, flexibility, and environmental protection. Aviation Security is one of the core components in NextGen. Without security protection, all NextGen functions will be vulnerable to various attacks and cannot work robustly. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Aviation Security (IAS) framework for defense-in-depth of various aspects of NextGen security such as cyber security and aircraft anti-hijacking. IAS uses a multi-layered, cross-component, and multi-planed (data plane and control plane) structure. Multiple components in NextGen such as communication, navigation, surveillance, air traffic management, aircraft anti-hijacking, access control, biometrics, risk analysis and management, etc, are processed integratedly through information fusion to enhance the security performance of each module. We will present a detailed implementation approach of IAS including the AlertEnterprise based Integrated Risk Management (IRM) Model, defense-in-depth of communication, navigation, surveillance, and aircraft anti-hijacking. Compared with disparate systems, the proposed IAS has much higher security performance to be effective against both outsider and insider threats."
316,End-to-end security in the presence of intelligent data adapting proxies: the case of authenticating transcoded streaming media,"We consider the problem of maintaining end-to-end security in the presence of intelligent proxies that may adaptively modify data being transmitted across a network. The video coding community considers this problem in the context of transcoding media streams, but their approaches either fail to address authentication or fail to provide meaningful security guarantees. We present two provably-secure schemes, LISSA and TRESSA, that allow an intelligent network intermediary to intercept a stream signed by a content provider, and adapt it dynamically, while preserving the ultimate receiver's ability to securely verify the content provider's signature (and, hence, authenticity and integrity of the data received). Our schemes allow the intermediary to selectively remove portions of the stream and, thus, permit common media transcoding techniques such as scalable compression and multiple file switching. Moreover, a content provider only has to encode and sign its entire data stream once, as opposed to nondynamically encoding and signing different versions for each anticipated combination of device, network configuration, and channel condition. Our implementation results demonstrate efficiency."
325,Design and Implementation of Multi-Mode Surveillance System for Several Applications,"With the rise in crimes, thefts, stealing, burglary, and offensive violations in today's technological age, it is critical that we install cameras in every conceivable public place to discover accused / criminals / fled persons. Security agents, such as cops, use public camera footage to track down the accused's movements. People are assigned to this responsibility of watching the public camera recordings. These individuals must constantly watch the detected faces and compare them to the accused faces. However, because this is a continual process, there is a high risk of manual errors when utilizing this method. The accused person's face can also be discovered using this method, but by the time the assigned person tells the nearest police station, the accused person may have left/escaped. With all of these considerations in mind, it is necessary to avoid these blunders. Manual mistake in determining the perpetrator's face and relaying the information to officials swiftly are the main problems. Installing a camera with an already supplied data collection of suspected people can help cross-check the detected faces with the uploaded data set, which is the first issue. This improves the precision of the accused's detection. The second issue is telling officials about the suspected criminal or accused in a timely manner. If the installed camera has a transmitting unit, with the receiver on the official side and the transmitter on the camera end, this will work. The information is swiftly transmitted to the authorities, and there is a good possibility that the perpetrator will be apprehended. A frequency band is fundamental for any transmission to actually occur. The frequency ranges essential for the above-mentioned transferring data are 400–500 Hz and 900–1000 Hz. The LoRa module will be used to use these bandwidths."
327,Hardware-in-the-loop design and optimal setting of adaptive protection schemes for distribution systems with distributed generation,"The constantly increasing presence of distributed generation (DG) in modern distribution systems induces grid configuration alterations, affecting thus the short-circuit levels and fault current paths. To address all arising protection challenges, adaptive protection is being implemented. This paper presents an innovative hardware-in-the-loop adaptive protection scheme, which incorporates real-time simulation, multifunction protection, centralized control, and optimal calculation of protection settings. The proposed adaptive scheme is based, first, on the determination of optimal relay setting groups, and then on their online self-adjustment, providing a continuously tuned protection scheme to the variable system operating modes. The efficacy of the proposed solution is demonstrated through two distribution test networks with embedded DG."
370,Design and Development of an AI based Intelligent Door for Home Security System,"These days, safety concerns are universal. A house, a factory, a bank, and so on are all things that virtually everyone desires. In today's world, when more and more people have easier access to various resources, it is increasingly vital to ensure that one has a safe place to live. There must be a way to keep us secure since the daily rise in crime rates demands it. We're all aware that there are sophisticated security systems out there, but unfortunately, they're out of reach for a lot of people. Trespassing, intrusion, and other forms of illegal entry are commonplace, with many common targets including banks, business offices, financial organizations, jewellery stores, and government organizations. Our goal is to alleviate this problem by creating a low-priced electronic system that can detect intruders' movements and trigger an alert. To this end, we offer a new Android app called Door Security System that makes use of IoT technology to keep tabs on the door's state, manage the door, and boost home safety. The smart lock system in this instance is an android-based one, and it can function in both single-mode and multi-mode settings. Financial and commercial institutions have an urgent need for this kind of technology. The system also provides features for the average user, who does not need to be the only one with access to the lock's controls. The system's high efficiency, low price, and cutting-edge features and user-friendly design all contribute to its value. In the event that the door is opened without permission, the alarm will sound and a message will be sent to the homeowners."
380,Adaptive Protection of Distribution Systems with DERs Considering Consumer and Generation Profiles,"Distributed Energy Resources (DER) penetration has a significant impact on the distribution protection system. Current flow during short-circuit and load flow depend on DERs' operating state, generated power, and short-circuits contribution as well as consumer loads. The more DER integration leads to more challenge to maintaining DER, feeder, and substation protections sensitive, selective, with fast response, and optimum reliability. The IEEE 34 Node Test Feeder used and extended by addition of photovoltaic, wind, and energy storage DERs. Consumer loads and DER's generation were extended from static values to typical load and generation profiles, which examined daily, weekly, and seasonal patterns. Protection device settings were calculated selectively in the absence of DERs. Using the method of Protection Security Assessment (PSA), automatically evaluate the correct operation of protection devices in case of different fault scenarios. Three-phase and single-phase metallic faults are applied to validate protection system security. The PSA reassessed DER contribution and influence on protection selectivity. Adaptive rules should fix identified miss-coordinations by modifying protection settings or feeder automation logic. This paper applied adaptive rules to improve protection settings. The PSA method and adaptive rules assumed for implementation in an Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS)."
398,SCIBORG: Secure Configurations for the IoT Based on optimization and Reasoning on Graphs,"Addressing security misconfiguration in complex distributed systems, such as networked Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Internet of Things (IoT) is challenging. Owners and operators must go beyond tuning parameters of individual components and consider the security implications of configuration changes on entire systems. Given the growing scale of cyber systems, this task must be highly automated. Unfortunately, prior work on configuration errors has largely ignored the security impact of configurations of connected components. To address this gap, we present SCIBORG, a framework that improves the security posture of distributed systems by examining the impact of configuration changes across interdependent components using a graph-based model of the system and its vulnerabilities. It formulates a Constraint Satisfaction Problem from the graph-based model and uses an SMT solver to find optimal configuration parameter values that minimize the impact of attacks while preserving system functionality. SCIBORG also provides supporting evidence for the proposed configuration changes. We evaluate SCIBORG on an IoT testbed."
424,Short-term Reliability Online Evaluation Basing On Transient State Probability,"The reliability of the power system in a future short term is studied according to the current state. Basing on this, we can alarm and prevent the outage to assure the safety and reliability of the power system. Traditional reliability is an expected value of long-term reliability level under the fixed operating mode, which cannot reflect the real time reliability level under the current operational state. This essay presents the novel conception and algorithm of online evaluating the short-term reliability in order to study the operational reliability level. The influence of the variable system states on the reliability level is reflected according to the real time operational information provided by the SCADA/EMS/WAMS. Markov process is adopted to solve the transient state probability of the components, so that forecasting the system state basing on the transient probability is possible. The probability of the system state and the reliability indices of the system changes as the time varying. The analysis and the assessment of IEEE RTS-79 system indicates that there are great differences between the short-term and long-term reliability indices, and only the transient probability evaluation can assess the short-term probability properly. In this paper the relationship between the enumerating number of the system states and the forecasting time is also studied. The result indicates that only a few system states are needed to get relative high degree of evaluation accuracy, which can be applied online. IEEE RTS-79 case study is calculated to verify this conclusion."
438,An Integrated Software System Designed for Upper Limb Rehabilitation Robot,"High treatment efficiency is urgently required considering the contradiction between the increase of spinal cord injury cases and the shortage of therapists. Hence, we design an integrated software system to solve the treatment efficiency problem by combining the administration and evaluation functions of a therapist with the training and testing functions of a rehabilitation robot. All information of therapists and patients is administrated digitally through a three-layer administration framework. A multi-modal training method library is developed to assist therapists in formulating individualized passive rehabilitation training programs for various patients. What's more, we propose a safety protection strategy for the safety of patients based on a joint angle filtering algorithm. The system was shown to improve hospital administration efficiency and to provide comprehensive, smooth, and safe upper limb rehabilitation training for patients. This paper provides a feasible solution to the contradiction between poorly integrated rehabilitation robot software systems and a shortage of therapists."
447,A Review of Factors Influencing the Implementation of Secure Framework for in-House Web Application Development in Malaysian Public Sector,"Every year, web applications have expanded their presence in more areas in financial organizations, health organizations, public sector, retail and accommodation. Security is important in data protection so as not to be infringed by unauthorized parties. If the vulnerabilities found are not amended, it leads to cyber-attacks such as Structured Query Language Injection Attack (SQLIA) performed by certain parties which enable them to gain unauthorized data access. To cater security issues, variety of security frameworks for secure software development life cycle (SDLC) were introduced. Secure SDLC is created by integrating security-related activities to an each phase of in used development methodologies such as waterfall model or agile model. However, the application security problem continues to grow. Strict, complicated and heavyweight frameworks are underutilized due to several factors. The factors that influence the implementation of secure SDLC identified in public sector (the scope is State Secretary Offices in Malaysia) are inadequate development timeline, improper development team size and less awareness of team members' workload. It is agreed that integrating security at earlier (requirement and design) phase is the most effective and cheapest way to develop secure web application. Hence, an adaptive secure SDLC model is proposed to integrate security activities using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) focusing on the influence factors as the main criteria and meet the international and local secure frameworks standards. The proposed model will recommend adaptive security activities as a guideline to be applied at earlier phases of SDLC to help eliminate/ minimize the web application vulnerabilities and increase the application security and implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype at selected Malaysian public sector for in-house web application development."
457,Improving smart grid operation with new Hierarchically Coordinated Protection approach,"Nowadays, power systems are characterized with heavy loading conditions, abrupt changes in generation patterns, extensive switching of power system configuration and high penetration of distributed generation (DG). Under those conditions performance of the conventional relays that rely on predefined settings may deteriorate leading to system wide disturbances and blackouts. To ensure reliable system operation, monitoring, control and protection have to be improved. In this paper, new Hierarchically Coordinated Protection (HCP) approach to mitigate the effects of increased grid complexity on its operation is proposed. The proposed approach utilizes local and wide area measurements and relies on the three HCP framework levels: fault anticipation and prediction, adaptive fault detection, and relay operation correction in case of unwanted tripping. It brings intelligence to the relays at all voltage levels and uses information and statistics from the systems such as weather, lightning, animal and bird migration patterns, component outage history, etc to enhance protection system tripping dependability and security."
470,Thirteen concepts to play it safe with the cloud,"Market trends show advanced usage of safety-critical systems with novel services based on smart data analytics. Customers require continuous updates to applications and services and seek lower costs, and easy-to-install solutions (maintenance) for safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). Leveraging edge and cloud technologies has the potential to enhance safety-critical CPS, also in regulated environments. This is only possible when safety, performance, cybersecurity, and privacy of data are kept at the same level as in on-device only safety-critical CPS.This paper presents thirteen selected safety and performance concepts for distributed device-edge-cloud CPS solutions. This early result of the TRANSACT project aims to ensure needed end-to-end performance and safety levels from an end-user perspective, to extend edge and cloud benefits of more rapid innovation and inclusion of value-added services, also to safety-critical CPS."
472,DES-SRAM IP-core: a SRAM embedding DES feature [secure SoC applications],"This paper proposes a DES-SRAM IP-core dedicated to secure SoCs. This core is an optimized hardware implementation of a DES (data encryption standard) secret key algorithm. The main idea was to implement a DES feature inside a basic SRAM in order to suppress data transfers during data encryption and thus to avoid a bus bottleneck as well as to increase SoC security. The DES capability only adds few percent hardware overhead, and our modified SRAM offers two operating modes: a basic SRAM mode and an encryption mode. The DES-SRAM self-encrypts each 64 bit block of its own data in 17 clock cycles."
538,Cybersecurity Analysis of Data-Driven Power System Stability Assessment,"Machine learning-based intelligent systems enhanced with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been widely developed and exploited to enable the real-time stability assessment of a large-scale electricity grid. However, it has been extensively recognized that the IoT-enabled communication network of power systems is vulnerable to cyberattacks. In particular, system operating states, critical attributes that act as input to the data-driven stability assessment, can be manipulated by malicious actors to mislead the system operator into making disastrous decisions and thus cause major blackouts and cascading events. In this article, we explore the vulnerability of the data-driven power system stability assessment, with a special emphasis on decision tree-based stability assessment (DTSA) approaches, and investigate the feasibility of constructing a physics-constrained adversarial attack (PCAA) to undermine the DTSA. The PCAA is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem considering the misclassification constraint, power limits, and bad data detection, computing potential adversarial perturbations that reverse the “stable/unstable” prediction of the real-time input while remaining invisible/stealthy. Extensive experiments based on the IEEE 68-bus system are conducted to evaluate the impact of PCAAs on predictions of DTSA and their transferability."
573,Smartcards and Secure Elements,"This chapter presents key technologies related to smartcards and secure elements (SEs), especially as they relate to the wireless systems. It outlines the available and future alternatives for traditional and enhanced variants of smartcards. Smartcards represent a type of SE hardware. Examples of solutions for providing SEs are the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), eSE, and external micro Secure Digital (SD) cards. Smartcards can be categorized by their physical characteristics such as contact and contactless variants, and by their functionality such as memory cards, Central Processing Unit (CPU) or Multi Processing Unit (MPU) cards with embedded OS, multi‐mode communications cards and hybrid cards. Smartcards can be divided into sub‐categories to distinguish between contact cards, contactless cards and multi‐component cards. The UICC communications are based on secure channels which ensure the secure communication between the smartcard and external world."
616,Incorporating Security Features in Service-Oriented Architecture Using Security Patterns,"Service-Oriented Architecture is an architectural style where different heterogeneous components share information with each other by using special types of messages based on the protocol known as Simple Object Access Protocol. Various technologies, such as Common Object Request Broker Architecture, Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, Java Message Service etc. are applied to realize Service-Oriented Architecture for different applications. Besides these approaches, two other techniques, REpresentational State Transfer, and web services are applied for the realization of Service-Oriented Architecture. Web services provide a platform independent communication scheme between applications. The security preservation among the composition of services is an important task for Service-Oriented Architecture. In this study, an attempt is made to incorporate security features in Service- Oriented Architecture with the help of software security patterns. This scheme is described by developing an architectural model integrated with security goals and security patterns. The structural and behavioral aspects of composition of web services incorporated with security features are presented using a Unified Modeling Language class diagram and a sequence diagram respectively. At the end of this study, an evaluation is performed between identified security patterns and critical security properties along with Service-Oriented Architecture design principles. A case study of an online banking system is considered to explain the use of security patterns."
624,The Runtime Model Checking Method for Zero Trust Security Policy,"The policy administrator is a zero trust dynamic authority determination component, which is mainly responsible for the management, storage and evaluation of policies. Aiming at the evaluation of the security and effectiveness of the policies in the policy administrator, this paper proposes to introduce the policy model online service verification component in the policy administrator. First, the policy file is formalized into a policy instance logic specification through logical abstraction, and then the policy instance logic specification Perform model check with the policy abstract logic specification developed by the policy designer to realize the pre-check verification of the consistency of the police file. After the completion of the pre-check and verification, the policy will be executed for the policy manager to make a decision on the execution point of the policy. At this time, the system operating state data intercepted by the policy enforcement point and the embedded system's security, compliance, and legal treaty form process specifications are used to perform model post-check to achieve the security and alarm after the implementation of the policy. Through the combination of pre-check and post-check, the evaluation and testing of the policy and effectiveness of the zero-trust security policy are finally realized."
637,Model-Driven Testing of RESTful APIs,"In contrast to the increasing popularity of REpresentational State Transfer (REST), systematic testing of RESTful Application Programming Interfaces (API) has not attracted much attention so far. This paper describes different aspects of automated testing of RESTful APIs. Later, we focus on functional and security tests, for which we apply a technique called model-based software development. Based on an abstract model of the RESTful API that comprises resources, states and transitions a software generator not only creates the source code of the RESTful API but also creates a large number of test cases that can be immediately used to test the implementation. This paper describes the process of developing a software generator for test cases using state-of-the-art tools and provides an example to show the feasibility of our approach."
645,Efficient Invisible Speculative Execution through Selective Delay and Value Prediction,"Speculative execution, the base on which modern high-performance general-purpose CPUs are built on, has recently been shown to enable a slew of security attacks. All these attacks are centered around a common set of behaviors: During speculative execution, the architectural state of the system is kept unmodified, until the speculation can be verified. In the event that a misspeculation occurs, then anything that can affect the architectural state is reverted (squashed) and re-executed correctly. However, the same is not true for the microarchitectural state. Normally invisible to the user, changes to the microarchitectural state can be observed through various side-channels, with timing differences caused by the memory hierarchy being one of the most common and easy to exploit. The speculative side-channels can then be exploited to perform attacks that can bypass software and hardware checks in order to leak information. These attacks, out of which the most infamous are perhaps Spectre and Meltdown, have led to a frantic search for solutions.In this work, we present our own solution for reducing the microarchitectural state-changes caused by speculative execution in the memory hierarchy. It is based on the observation that if we only allow accesses that hit in the L1 data cache to proceed, then we can easily hide any microarchitectural changes until after the speculation has been verified. At the same time, we propose to prevent stalls by value predicting the loads that miss in the L1. Value prediction, though speculative, constitutes an invisible form of speculation, not seen outside the core. We evaluate our solution and show that we can prevent observable microarchitectural changes in the memory hierarchy while keeping the performance and energy costs at 11% and 7%, respectively. In comparison, the current state of the art solution, InvisiSpec, incurs a 46% performance loss and a 51% energy increase."
648,Transmission and Distribution Real-Time Analysis Software for Monitoring and Control: Design and Simulation Testing,"The US electric grid is facing operational, stability, and security challenges. Transmission system operators need some measure of visibility into distribution system renewable generation. Distribution system generation needs to support transmission system voltage. The grid is experiencing an expansion in measurement systems. How to take full advantage of this expansion and defend against attacks, both cyber and physical, poses additional challenges. This paper introduces software designed to meet these challenges. At the center of the software is an Integrated System Model (ISM) that spans from transmission to secondary distribution. The ISM is employed in real-time abnormality detection, voltage stability forecasting, and multi-mode control. The software architecture along with selected analysis modules is presented. Testing results are presented for: 1—attacks on utility infrastructure; 2—energy savings from optimal control; 3—distribution system control response during a low voltage transmission system event; 4—cyber-attacks on PV inverters, where physical inverters are used in hardware-in-the-simulation-loop studies. Contributions of this work include real-time analysis that spans from three-phase transmission through secondary distribution; an approach for detecting abnormalities that employs measurements from three independent measurement systems; and a multi-mode distribution system control that responds to cyber-attacks, physical attacks, equipment failures, and transmission system needs. © 2023 by the authors."
655,Adaptively secure multi-authority attribute-based broadcast encryption in fog computing,"Fog computing is considered an important development in cloud computing, with shorter response times, less data transfer load and a more secure distributed service architecture that can be accessed by a wide range of end devices. As with cloud computing, it also faces the challenge of how to securely distribute sensitive data. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based Broadcast Encryption (CP-ABBE) can protect sensitive data and provide fine-grained access control with user revocation. However, existing CP-ABBE schemes suffer many limitations when implemented in a fog computing environment: a single authority performs poorly in handling requests or data from many IoT devices, leading to system delays or limited functionality; expensive decryption costs make the computation and storage overheads unfriendly to devices with limited resources; these schemes are only proven selectively secure, meaning that security was proven in a weaker model. In this paper, using threshold secret sharing and decryption delegation, we propose an adaptively secure attribute-based multi-authority broadcast encryption (MA-ABBE) scheme that breaks through these limitations. The comparison and analysis results show that our scheme is practical and achieves adaptive security, enables user-side fast decryption and low storage overhead, and provides a secure and efficient option for protecting sensitive data in fog computing environments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."
676,"Broadcast, Trace and Revoke with Optimal Parameters from Polynomial Hardness","A broadcast, trace and revoke system generalizes broadcast encryption as well as traitor tracing. In such a scheme, an encryptor can specify a list L⊆ N of revoked users so that (i) users in L can no longer decrypt ciphertexts, (ii) ciphertext size is independent of L, (iii) a pirate decryption box supports tracing of compromised users. The “holy grail” of this line of work is a construction which resists unbounded collusions, achieves all parameters (including public and secret key) sizes independent of |L| and |N|, and is based on polynomial hardness assumptions. In this work we make the following contributions: 1.Public Trace Setting: We provide a construction which (i) achieves optimal parameters, (ii) supports embedding identities (from an exponential space) in user secret keys, (iii) relies on polynomial hardness assumptions, namely compact functional encryption (FE ) and a key-policy attribute based encryption (ABE ) with special efficiency properties, and (iv) enjoys adaptive security with respect to the revocation list. The previous best known construction by Nishimaki, Wichs and Zhandry (Eurocrypt 2016) which achieved optimal parameters and embedded identities, relied on indistinguishability obfuscation, which is considered an inherently subexponential assumption and achieved only selective security with respect to the revocation list.2.Secret Trace Setting: We provide the first construction with optimal ciphertext, public and secret key sizes and embedded identities from any assumption outside Obfustopia. In detail, our construction relies on Lockable Obfuscation which can be constructed using LWE (Goyal, Koppula, Waters and Wichs, Zirdelis, Focs 2017) and two ABE schemes: (i) the key-policy scheme with special efficiency properties by Boneh et al. (Eurocrypt 2014) and (ii) a ciphertext-policy ABE for P which was recently constructed by Wee (Eurocrypt 2022) using a new assumption called evasive and tensor LWE. This assumption, introduced to build an ABE, is believed to be much weaker than lattice based assumptions underlying FE or iO – in particular it is required even for lattice based broadcast, without trace. Moreover, by relying on subexponential security of LWE, both our constructions can also support a super-polynomial sized revocation list, so long as it allows efficient representation and membership testing. Ours is the first work to achieve this, to the best of our knowledge. © 2023, International Association for Cryptologic Research."
699,An Asynchronous AAA Blockchain-Based Protocol for Configuring Information Systems,"The increasing number of security breaches in centralized systems provides the necessity to introduce decentralization in more fields. The Blockchain is a widely utilized decentralization technology that is implemented in various industries. Therefore, this technology can be used to protect sensitive services, such as those associated with the configuration changing of information systems. This article proposes a new protocol operating as a decentralization layer over any configuration scheme. It uses smart contracts—programs existing on the Blockchain—to keep track of configuration proposals and authorize new configurations. The configuration change can be proposed at any time. However, only once it is authorized by appropriate parties can it be introduced to the system. The new protocol provides an additional security layer, ensuring that every action is accounted for and authenticated. Furthermore, it enforces that administrators authorize every change. The protocol was designed to be flexible and easily adaptable to scenarios that did not use distributed ledger technology before. It uses the HTTP protocol with the JSON standard for protocol messages to allow easier adoption and transparency. The features of the proposed protocol were analyzed from a security point of view as well as from the financial perspective related to costs of using Blockchain technology. Security analysis shows that the protocol is resilient to the most common security risks that haunt state-of-the-art IT systems. Additionally, the authors proved that this solution could be implemented in both private and public Blockchains. A reference implementation was shared in a public repository. The proposed protocol was also compared with the most similar state-of-the-art work in the academic research highlighting the key differences and improvements. © 2022 by the authors."
721,SRE_BBC: A Self‐Adaptive Security Enabled Requirements Engineering Approach for SLA Smart Contracts in Blockchain‐Based Cloud Systems,"Current blockchain‐based cloud (BBC) systems have several security vulnerabilities regarding smart contracts (SC), and several attacks have been reported recently. The SC development lacks standard design processes that follow software lifecycle principles to model secure SC. Secondly, the security mechanisms in the SC are not constantly evolved to resist evolving adversary attacks. BBC systems lack self‐adaptive security capability to make spontaneous decisions when adversarial attacks are encountered. To build a self‐adaptive secure BBC system that follows standard software development lifecycle principles to model secure SC, we propose the so‐called selfadaptive security RE_BBC framework. The framework would utilize the MAPE‐BBC adaptation loop to make decisions internally based on the threat models, goal models, and service level agreement (SLA) SC security specifications. The framework identifies vulnerabilities and threats and takes precautionary measures using self‐adaptive SC agents. We validated the proposed methodology theoretically and empirically, and statistically proved the research questions and hypothesis using the t‐test and Mann–Whitney U test. Subsequently, we compare our proposed approach with the Security Quality Requirements Engineering approach (SQUARE). The feasibility results and the replicated study results indicate that the proposed approach outperformed the SQUARE approach in terms of artifacts quality, self‐adaptive security evaluation quality, efficiency in response time, complexity, and usefulness of the proposed approach for the Healthcare Data Management (HDM) system. SC security developers can immensely benefit from our proposed methodology. They need not reengineer SC from scratch; depending on their security needs and plan, the contract can be adapted to execute a new plan. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
723,A Comprehensive Assessment Framework for Evaluating Adaptive Security and Privacy Solutions for IoT e-Health Applications,"There exist numerous adaptive security and privacy (S&P) solutions to manage potential threats at runtime. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive assessment framework that can holistically validate their effectiveness. Existing Adaptive S&P assessment efforts either focus on privacy or security in general, or are focused on specific adaptive S&P attributes, e.g. authentication, and, at certain times, disregards the architecture in which they should be comprehended. In this paper, we propose a holistic assessment framework for evaluating adaptive S&P solutions for IoT e-health. The framework utilizes a proposed classification of essential attributes necessary to be recognized, evaluated, and incorporated for the effectiveness of adaptive S&P solutions for the most common IoT architectures, fog-based and cloud/server-based architectures. As opposed to the existing related work, the classification comprehensively covers all the major classes of essential attributes, such as S&P objectives, contextual factors, adaptation action aptitude, and the system’s self-* properties. Using this classification, the framework assists to evaluate the existence of a given attribute with respect to the adaptation process and in the context of the architectural layers. Therefore, it stresses the importance of where an essential attribute should be realized in the adaptation phases and in the architecture for an adaptive S&P solution to be effective. We have also presented a comparison of the proposed assessment framework with existing related frameworks and have shown that it exhibits substantial completeness over the existing works to assess the feasibility of a given adaptive S&P solution. © 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

743,Adaptive Security for Cognitive Robotic Process Automation in Enterprise Computing Using AI-Powered Analytical Engine,"The robotic process automation (RPA) in enterprise computing refers to software bots that are capable of mimicking most of the human–computer interactions to carry out day-to-day business operations. This RPA is targeted for automating rule-based repetitive and high-volume tasks with higher accuracy which eventually reduces the operation cost and processing time. The cognitive automation which is being developed as part of enterprise computing automation best utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enhance the process model of RPA in terms of improved accuracy, reliability, and consistency in taking intelligent business decisions with no or minimal human interventions. The majority of the communications between computing nodes and bots are being provisioned through service-oriented enterprise computing interfaces, which are built based on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). The SOA by itself does not possess any security layer and it defaults to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model for security that is inadequate in this modern era of process automation and interfacing. In this paper, the security concerns of Cognitive RPA for enterprise computing are analyzed, and a novel approach is presented for adding-up the security layer for Cognitive RPA. This is an adaptive approach which works on the predict-prevent-learn pattern for effective proactive security as differed from traditional reactive security, where the Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are used for ‘predict’ part for predicting potential security threats, the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) techniques are applied for ‘learn’ part on unsupervised learning of anticipated security vulnerabilities, and security prevention algorithms are equipped for ‘prevent’ part to defend against the security threats on Cognitive RPA systems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
789,A data-driven approach to anomaly detection and vulnerability dynamic analysis for large-scale integrated energy systems,"In an integrated energy system (IES), the operating state of each energy subsystem changes relatively frequently, which can seriously threaten the security of IES operation. A systematic data-driven approach is proposed for detecting anomalies and analyzing the dynamics of IES vulnerability. Firstly, an anomaly detection method is introduced to determine whether there are anomalies in the system operation. The method can be set up even if the data labels for discriminating the anomalies are unknown, often the cause in practice. Secondly, a method of complex network phase theory is proposed to model information propagation among IES nodes representative of the IES physical entities. Complex network models can then be constructed to describe the system behavior in different operating conditions and over different time horizons. The degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality are used as indications to analyze changes in IES vulnerability. Finally, a method is proposed to identify the critical points of the IES from the point of view of its vulnerability. The new approach is applied to analyze the vulnerability of an IES in Spain. The results show that the proposed methods allow revealing system anomalies, vulnerability and weaknesses. Outcomes from an analysis by these methods can be used by managers to take defensive measures in advance for preventing and mitigating the impact of potential factors and threats on the IES. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
827,New Dataset for Industry 4.0 to Address the Change in Threat Landscape,"Because of its connectivity and its convergence with the IT world, industry 4.0 has become one of the main target sectors of the attackers. These last few years, they improve their operating mode and hit with more sophisticated attacks. Anomaly-based Intrusions Detection Systems (IDS) use datasets to train the classification algorithms they use to detect these attacks. Their detection capacity is therefore strongly linked to the representativeness of these datasets and the attacks they address. Actually, few datasets focus on the specificities of Industry 4.0 and even less propose a realistic labeled dataset. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to propose an industrial labeled dataset. It is characterized by several novelties consisting firstly in the fact that this data adds application features related to the industrial protocol Modbus. Then, it simulates twelve IT and OT attacks in a real environment. And finally in the labelling process, it contains 3 labels: one to characterize normal traffic, another for abnormal traffic and a specific label to distinguish the equipment reaction against an attack from the other types of data. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
865,Application design phase risk assessment framework using cloud security domains,"Security risk assessment is done to identify the vulnerabilities of a client's application and develop strong security measures within budgetary constraints. However, while migrating to the Cloud platform, a generic notion of their publicly available security policies make it challenging for clients to assess the security threats solely relevant to their applications. Additionally, traditional risk assessment techniques cannot address these challenges as they neither consider cloud security domains as assessment criteria nor identifies critical system resources that need to be protected in the likelihood of a successful attack. In order to address these challenges, this paper presents a risk assessment framework for clients’ applications that is characterized by the inclusion of cloud security metrics to perform risk assessment during the design phase of an application by incorporating the techniques of cloud misuse patterns. It also helps improve the security requirements phase that precedes risk assessment, by illustrating clients how different attack scenarios can spread through the applications by using the concepts of percolation centrality and probabilistic state transition diagrams. One of the key findings this work address is how to systematically gain a distinction between multiple system resources belonging to the same security defense priority level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
874,Dynamic Security Metrics for Software-Defined Network-based Moving Target Defense,"We propose a suite of dynamic security metrics that timely, dynamically, and adaptively assess the effectiveness of the software-defined network (SDN)-based moving target defense (MTD) techniques. The security metrics are developed to measure the dynamics of a network and a host state's information (e.g., IP address, port, software stacks, vulnerabilities, or network topology) introduced by various types of MTD techniques shuffling them. The key aspect of our proposed metrics is to capture variability that keeps track of changing patterns of the network and the host states upon every MTD triggering event. In this work, we propose the following security metrics capturing the variability based on the changes made by the MTD: (1) Network and host address-based metrics measuring variability of the network and host addresses based on a degree of uncertainty and unpredictability on the assigned IP address to the hosts in a network; (2) Attack path-based metrics measuring variability of attack paths using graphical models estimated based on the network state transitions from one topology to another topology upon triggering a network topology and/or IP shuffling MTD; and (3) Attack stage-based success metrics measuring the chances of discovering a vulnerable target host's information, exploiting the target host's vulnerability, and compromising the target host. Via extensive simulation study, we investigated the key parameters that can significantly affect the MTD performance based on the proposed security metrics. Our simulation results show that the metrics are viable to measure the effectiveness of deploying the MTD techniques. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
897,"Security tokens: architecture, smart contract applications and illustrations using SAFE","Purpose: Blockchain technologies have pervaded modern crowdfunding and capital sourcing through a variety of financial instruments implemented as smart contracts. Smart contracts provide a unique mechanism not only to create a unique one-of-a-type financial instrument, but also to enable unique innovations atop existing financial instruments due to underlying efficiencies. The smartness comes from the flexibility that programs provide which can create extremely unique financial instruments that are often complex to implement, yet easy to create, maintain through versioning, trade and destroy. The purpose of this paper is to describe the security token architecture as an application of smart contracts. Further, the author illustrates the implementation and design of a commonly used financial instrument known as Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) using the security token architecture proposed and smart contract functionality. The author then models the transaction using relational algebra, and, models the utility maximization. The author shows how on account of reduced information asymmetry between the investors and SAFE users (i.e. startups) utility is positive when smart contract-based security tokens are deployed for each state in the SAFE contract. Design/methodology/approach: Using an existing well-adopted instrument called a SAFE contract, the author illustrates the architecture of a smart contract-based security token system. The author illustrates how different components of a SAFE contract can be implemented as a smart contract and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of applying blockchain-based smart contracts to design SAFE instruments. The author deploys two methods: a state space diagram to explain state transitions and a utility model to explain the utilities. Findings: The key findings of this research study are the design of a security token architecture, which can be used to convert any the physical or contract-based financial instrument to a smart contract that runs on the blockchain. However, there are limitations to the implementation of the same which can be overcome. The model illustrates the positive utilities derived for all economic actors, i.e. the contractors, the utility providers, etc., in the market. Originality/value: This paper is an original paper. For the very first time, the author explored the architecture of a security token system. Using a well-known financial instrument, namely the SAFE, the author describes various components, e.g. the four contracts that form SAFE and then model the utilities for the system. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."
901,Introduction,"In the recent couple of years, smart devices and sensors in IoT applications are growing drastically and generating an extensive amount of multi-modal and heterogeneous data, designated as Big Data (BD). BD requires several intelligent computation systems such as data mining and data analytics to handle BD-related storage challenges on a cloud. Presently, Cloud Computing (CC) is comprehensively used in the industry to handle BD challenges, but it raises various issues such as latency, security, and high cost for data management. The promising technology Fog Computing (FC) facilitates at the edge of a cloud to handle the aforementioned issues. The analytics on fog data generated by diverse IoT devices is one of the challenging tasks. In this chapter, we discourse on the complexity and uniqueness of Fog Data Analytics (FDA). A detailed discussion on FDA architecture is abstracted with the innovative process model. This chapter highlights the various attributes of the FDA for IoT applications and discusses the FDA classification like fog data collection, storage, and analytics on it. The proposed FDA process model addresses numerous research challenges, such as scalability, accessibility, heterogeneity, reliability, nodal collaboration, and quality of service (QoS) with future research directions. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
908,Low-Cost Architecture of the Universal Security Threat Detection System for Industrial IoT,"The chapter presents the new architecture of the distributed threat detection system for broadly understood information system security. Unlike existing systems, the system is heterogeneous in terms of information, communication, operation and hardware, architecturally using industrial Internet of Things solutions. Additionally, it is separated from the entity’s basic IT structure and based on the extensive use of parallel and distributed processing. In most of the available literature, improvements are sought in the way of wireless communication. In this work, the wired communication environment is examined, that is the backbone of any wireless sensor network. From the algorithmic point of view, it uses intelligent data analysis and biologically inspired methods. Communication environment is described using mainly graph theory, graph algebra and probability. The data collected by a heterogeneous group of autonomous traffic analyzers located at all levels of the communication hierarchy of the industrial information system is subjected to permanent analysis. Depending on the operating mode, the analyzers communicate with the central security node in one of three possible, complementary modes of transmission. Operating mode also determine how data is processed. In the simplest case it is carried out on the central node resources. On the other hand, in the most advanced one the system is in fact a parallel computer based on analyzers resources. The proposed architecture in the standard operating mode is integrated with the classic information system, in each of the emergency modes is separated from it. The work ends with the presentation of the empirical research results on the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
909,An Adaptive Security Architecture for Detecting Ransomware Attack Using Open Source Software,"Ransomware is a serious security threat faced by organizations and individuals today, and ransomware attacks are on the increase. There is no infallible solution for protecting against ransomware as the malware code uses metamorphic and polymorphic algorithms to generate different versions thus evading signature detection. Ransomware also uses domain generator algorithms (DGA) to generate new domains for the command and control server (C&C), they constantly exploit new vulnerabilities, and they use various infection vectors. Thus, for an organization to protect itself, an adaptive security architecture is required to constantly monitor the network so as to detect new ransomware infection at an early stage such that it can be blocked before encryption of files occur. This approach is a defence in depth approach which supplements the network defences such as patch management, anti-virus software, intrusion detection, firewalls, and content filtering. A framework for the implementation of the adaptive security architecture model using open source software is presented and the proposed framework is tested against the WannaCry and Petya ransomware. The proposed framework was successfully able to alert of the ransomware attack and by the use of the AppLocker feature on Windows, it was even possible to prevent the Petya ransomware from executing on the victim host. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020."
918,Unbounded HIBE with Tight Security,"We propose the first tightly secure and unbounded hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) scheme based on standard assumptions. Our main technical contribution is a novel proof strategy that allows us to tightly randomize user secret keys for identities with arbitrary hierarchy depths using low entropy hidden in a small and hierarchy-independent master public key. The notion of unbounded HIBE is proposed by Lewko and Waters (Eurocrypt 2011). In contrast to most HIBE schemes, an unbounded scheme does not require any maximum depth to be specified in the setup phase, and user secret keys or ciphertexts can be generated for identities of arbitrary depths with hierarchy-independent system parameters. While all the previous unbounded HIBE schemes have security loss that grows at least linearly in the number of user secret key queries, the security loss of our scheme is only dependent on the security parameter, even in the multi-challenge setting, where an adversary can ask for multiple challenge ciphertexts. We prove the adaptive security of our scheme based on the Matrix Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption in prime-order pairing groups, which generalizes a family of standard Diffie-Hellman assumptions such as k-Linear. © 2020, International Association for Cryptologic Research."
919,Characterizing Internet-Scale ICS Automated Attacks Through Long-Term Honeypot Data,"Industrial control system (ICS) devices with IP addresses are accessible on the Internet and become an essential part of critical infrastructures. The adoption of ICS devices also yields cyber-attacks targeted specific port based on proprietary industrial protocols. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of these ICS threats in cyberspace. To this end, this paper uniquely exploits active interaction on ICS-related ports and analysis of long-term multi-port traffic in a first attempt ever to capture and comprehend ICS automated attacks based on private protocols. Specially, we first propose a minimal-interaction scheme for ICS honeypot(MirrorPot), which can listen on any port and respond automatically without understanding the protocol format. Then, we devise a preprocessing algorithm to extract requests payload and classify them from long-term honeypot-captured data. Finally, to better characterize the ICS attacks based on private industrial protocols, we propose a Markov state transition model for describing their attack complexity. Our experiments show that there are several unknown probing methods have not been observed by previous works. We concur that our work provides a solid first step towards capturing and comprehending real ICS attacks based on private protocols. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
930,Discovering and utilising expert knowledge from security event logs,"Vulnerability assessment and security configuration of computer systems is heavily dependent on human experts, which are widely attributed as being in short supply. This can result in a system being left insecure because of the lack of easily accessible experience and specialist resources. While performing security tasks, human experts often revert to a system's event logs to establish security information (configuration changes, errors, etc.). However, finding and exploiting knowledge from event logs is a challenging and time-consuming task for non-experts. Hence there is a strong need to provide mechanisms to make the process easier for security experts, as well as providing tools for those with significantly less security expertise. In this paper, we present a novel technique to process security event logs of a system that have been evaluated and configured by a security expert, extract key domain knowledge indicative of human decision making, and automatically apply acquired knowledge to previously unseen systems by non-experts to propose security improvements. The proposed solution utilises rule mining algorithms to extract security actions from event log entries. The set of identified rules is represented as a domain action model. The domain model and problem instance generated from a previously unseen system can then be used to produce a plan-of-action, which can be exploited by non-professionals to improve their system's security. Empirical analysis is subsequently performed on 21 event logs, where the acquired domain model and identified plans are discussed in terms of accuracy and performance. © 2019"
940,Adaptive Security for Smart Contracts using High Granularity Metrics,"In this work, we present a systems centric approach towards implementing security in Blockchain ecosystems. First, we detail the motivation for our security approach. Then, we detail the foundation of this approach by describing the concept of inline, Non-invasive High Granularity Metrics (HGMs). Following this, we outline how such metrics can be used effectively to monitor Blockchain ecosystems to detect behavior that is not deemed secure. We describe how they can be used to build whitelist and blacklist access controls in an adaptive manner, and then describe how they can be effectively used to detect potentially malicious behavior that is not yet baked into the access control structures. Finally, we discuss scalability and potential improvements for future work. © 2019 ACM."
948,Pixel-based operating modes from surveillance videos for structural vibration monitoring: A preliminary experimental study,"This paper presents a practical and cost effective method for vibration monitoring using multiple surveillance cameras distributed throughout (within) a building structure. Robust feature points in surveillance footage are identified and tracked frame-by-frame (with the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi tracker) to extract the pixel motions. The relative pixel motions from multiple locations within the structure are analyzed in the frequency domain to estimate dynamic characteristics of the monitored structure (e.g., the dominant frequencies), as well as the pixel-based operating modes. These pixel-based modes importantly are in pixel units, eliminating the need to converted to engineering (physical) units. The method is verified through an experimental parametric study on a three-story lab-scale building structure (with three surveillance cameras) excited by broadband white noise signals. The accuracy and repeatability of the method are assessed to evaluate its application for structural health monitoring. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"
954,An overview of methodologies for cybersecurity vulnerability assessments conducted in nuclear power plants,"Cyber-attacks against critical energy infrastructure have gone from possible to eventual to actual. With electrical generation sources in the United States changing under a wide range of pressures, the current fleet of nuclear power plants in the United States provides a reliable and sustainable source of electrical generation capacity. However, in order to extend the lifetime of the fleet, modernization upgrades to digital instrumentation and control systems are required. While this produces many opportunities for increased efficiency, it introduces a new level of complexity for securing and reliably operating reactors in the presence cyber-threats. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission recently began urging stronger cybersecurity efforts at nuclear power plants. As upgrades at nuclear power plants begin, the implementation of digital instrumentation and control systems to monitor and run the power plant introduces new vulnerabilities that must be addressed. This necessitates a more modern discussion of risk. Within this context, we critically review past cyber-vulnerability incidents at nuclear installations and other critical facilities. We then analyze challenges to vulnerabilities within the context of modernization of the current nuclear fleet and propose future research directions needed to resolve these issues. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."
962,Multimodal graph analysis of cyber attacks,"The limited information on the cyberattacks available in the unclassified regime, hardens standardizing the analysis. We address the problem of modeling and analyzing cyberattacks using a multimodal graph approach. We formulate the stages, actors, and outcomes of cyberattacks as a multimodal graph. Multimodal graph nodes include cyberattack victims, adversaries, autonomous systems, and the observed cyber events. In multimodal graphs, single-modality graphs are interconnected according to their interaction. We apply community and centrality analysis on the graph to obtain in-depth insights into the attack. In community analysis, we cluster those nodes that exhibit 'strong' inter-modal ties. We further use centrality to rank the nodes according to their importance. Classifying nodes according to centrality provides the progression of the attack from the attacker to the targeted nodes. We apply our methods to two popular case studies, namely GhostNet and Putter Panda and demonstrate a clear distinction in the attack stages. © 2019 SCS."
967,Adaptive security-related data collection with context awareness,"The huge economic loss resulting from network attacks and intrusions has led to an intensive study on network security. The network security is usually reflected by some relevant data that can be collected in a network system. By learning and analyzing such data, which are called security-related data, we can detect the intrusions to the network system and further measure its security level. Clearly, the first step of detecting network intrusions is to collect security-related data. However, in the context of 5G and big data, there are a number of challenges in collecting these data due to the heterogeneity of network and ever-growing amount of data. Therefore, traditional data collection methods cannot be applied in the next generation network systems directly, especially for security-related data. This paper presents the design and implementation of an adaptive security-related data collector based on network context in heterogeneous networks. The proposed collector solves the issue of heterogeneity of network system by designing a Security-related Data Description Language (SDDL) to instruct security related data collection in various networking contexts. It also applies adaptive sampling algorithms to reduce the amount of collected data. Furthermore, performance evaluation based on a prototype implementation shows the effectiveness of the adaptive security-related data collector in terms of a number of pre-defined design requirements. © 2018 The Author(s)"
978,Nodes Availability Analysis of NB-IoT Based Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks under Malware Infection,"The Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a main stream technology based on mobile communication system. The combination of NB-IoT and WSNs can active the application of WSNs. In order to evaluate the influence of node heterogeneity on malware propagation in NB-IoT based Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks, we propose a node heterogeneity model based on node distribution and vulnerability differences, which can be used to analyze the availability of nodes. We then establish the node state transition model by epidemic theory and Markov chain. Further, we obtain the dynamic equations of the transition between nodes and the calculation formula of node availability. The simulation result is that when the degree of node is small and the node vulnerability function is a power function, the node availability is the highest; when the degree of node is large and the node vulnerability function satisfies the exponential function and the power function, the node availability is high. Therefore, when constructing a NBIOT-HWSNs network, node protection is implemented according to the degree of node, so that when the node vulnerability function satisfies the power function, all nodes can maintain high availability, thus making the entire network more stable. © 2019 Xiaojun Wu et al."
993,Feature-Driven Mediator Synthesis,"As the number, complexity, and heterogeneity of connected devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) increase, so does our need to secure these devices, the environment in which they operate, and the assets they manage or control. Collaborative security exploits the capabilities of these connected devices and opportunistically composes them to protect assets from potential harm. By dynamically composing these capabilities, collaborative security implements the security controls that satisfy both security and non-security requirements. However, this dynamic composition is often hampered by the heterogeneity of the devices available in the environment and the diversity of their behaviours. In this article, we present a systematic, tool-supported approach for collaborative security where the analysis of requirements drives the opportunistic composition of capabilities to realise the appropriate security control in the operating environment. This opportunistic composition is supported through a combination of feature modelling and mediator synthesis. We use features and transition systems to represent and reason about capabilities and requirements. We formulate the selection of the optimal set of features to implement adequate security control as a multi-objective constrained optimisation problem and use constraint programming to solve it efficiently. The selected features are then used to scope the behaviours of the capabilities and thereby restrict the state space for synthesising the appropriate mediator. The synthesised mediator coordinates the behaviours of the capabilities to satisfy the behaviour specified by the security control. Our approach ensures that the implemented security controls are the optimal ones, given the capabilities available in the operating environment. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by implementing a feature-driven mediation for collaborative security tool and applying it to a collaborative robots case study. © 2018 ACM."
1007,A multi-modal urban traffic agent-based framework to study individual response to catastrophic events,"Urban traffic is made of a variety of mobility modes that have to be taken into account to explore the impact of catastrophic event. From individual mobility behaviors to macroscopic traffic dynamics, agent-based modeling provides an interesting conceptual framework to study this question. Unfortunately, most proposals in the domain do not provide any simple way to model these multi-modal trajectories, and thus fell short at simulating in a credible way the outcomes of a catastrophic event, like natural or industrial hazards. This paper presents an agent-based framework implemented with the GAMA modeling platform that aims at overcoming this lack. An application of this model for the study of flood crisis in a district of Hanoi (Vietnam) is presented. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018."
1017,Edge aggregation based Bayesian modeling of cyber attacks in hypervisor-enabled IaaS cloud networks,"The Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering of cloud computing has come to alleviate some of the challenges associated with infrastructural investments and other related costs for enterprise users. However, hypervisor networks in IaaS environments are not immune to security breaches as the components therein tend to exhibit vulnerabilities which are exploited by attackers. Attackers chain together these vulnerabilities for effective attack path traversal in a given attack. The challenge has not been in identifying the vulnerable components but in capturing the dependencies amongst the vulnerabilities and statistically evaluating the effect exerted by one vulnerability unto another. In this paper, we capture the dependencies between vulnerabilities in hypervisor networks by aggregating incoming attack edges via disjunction and conjunction of attack events in the resultant Bayesian attack network. We illustrate the use of local conditional probabilities distributions at a given node to evaluate the likelihood of node exploitation for attack propagation under varying conditions. We further identify critical nodes and edges without which a given attack will not materialize and show how a security analyst can use such in the security mitigation process. We model the security status of the target node using a finite state machine where state transitions are induced by attack instances in the aggregated critical edge. © 2017 IEEE."
1034,Ensuring database security with the universal basis of relations,"The subject matter of the article is methods and means of the databases (DBs) security ensuring, built on the basis of the database scheme that is invariant to subject domains (SDs). The goal is to develop a substantiated approach that implements the complex use of various mechanisms ensuring the databases security built on the database schema with the universal basis of relations. The task: based on the analysis of existing database protection mechanisms supported by various database management systems (DBMSs), and features of the destination, construction of the database schema with the universal basis of relations, to develop and present in a systematized form the means and methods ensuring the databases security built on this DB schema.

1044,Orpheus: Enforcing cyber-physical execution semantics to defend against data-oriented attacks,"Recent studies have revealed that control programs running on embedded devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g., code-injection or code-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks). Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime data-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics checking. In this work, we propose Orpheus, a security methodology for defending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution semantics. We address several challenges in reasoning cyber-physical execution semantics of a control program, including the event identification and dependence analysis. As an instantiation of Orpheus, we present a new program behavior model, i.e., the event-Aware finite-state automaton (eFSA). eFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of control programs and incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented exploits if physical events and eFSA's state transitions are inconsistent. We evaluate our prototype's performance by conducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that eFSA can successfully detect different runtime attacks. Our prototype on Raspberry Pi incurs a low overhead, taking 0.0001s for each state transition integrity checking, and 0.063s-0.211s for the cyber-physical contextual consistency checking. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

1069,Evaluation of interface modality for control of multiple unmanned vehicles,"The U.S. Air Force envisions future applications in which a single human operator manages multiple heterogeneous unmanned vehicles (UVs). To support this vision, a range of play-based interfaces were designed by which an operator can team with autonomy (consisting of several intelligent agents/services) to manage twelve air, ground, and sea surface UVs performing security defense tasks for a simulated military base. To enable flexible delegation control, the interfaces were designed to enable the operator to use one or more of three control modalities in calling and editing plays that define UV actions. Specifically, each step defining a play could be completed: (1) manually, via mouse/click inputs, (2) by touching a touchscreen monitor, or (3) via speech commands. This paper reports results relevant to input modality from two experiments where operators were free to choose which modality to employ. Operators overwhelmingly used the mouse compared to the touchscreen or speech and were faster and more accurate with the mouse. Subjective data also favored the mouse modality with operators commenting that it was more intuitive to use with the play calling interfaces. Results are discussed and recommendations for further multimodal research are provided. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017."
1082,"A lightweight, adaptive security mechanism","Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) allow vehicles to exchange information with other vehicles [vehicle to vehicle (V2V)] and with nearby roadside infrastructures [vehicle to infrastructure (V2I)] in real time, thus providing a number of value-added services to create a safer and more efficient traffic environment [59]. Due to factors closely related to driving safety and even potential life risk, VANETs impose stringent conditions on communication quality and security protection for timely and reliable information dissemination. Unlike the traditional wired network, VANETs are characterized by numerous new features, e.g., quick movement and unstable channel. These characteristics cause many challenging issues and limitations, e.g., bandwidth shortage, latency sensitivity, and serious Doppler effects, all of which make simultaneously harmonizing quality of service (QoS) and security difficult. To address these technical issues in an organizational way, European Telecommunications 188Standards Institute/International Organization for Standardization (ETSI/ISO) jointly proposed a horizontal/vertical mixture as the intelligent transport systems (ITS) station reference architecture. Such elaborate design structure enables the joint optimization of two seemingly conflicting topics of the communication quality and security and facilitates the redesign of the related protocols and controlling algorithms to optimally utilize the restrictive resources. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
1104,OpenID Connect as a security service in cloud-based medical imaging systems,"The evolution of cloud computing is driving the next generation of medical imaging systems. However, privacy and security concerns have been consistently regarded as the major obstacles for adoption of cloud computing by healthcare domains. OpenID Connect, combining OpenID and OAuth together, is an emerging representational state transfer-based federated identity solution. It is one of the most adopted open standards to potentially become the de facto standard for securing cloud computing and mobile applications, which is also regarded as ""Kerberos of cloud."" We introduce OpenID Connect as an authentication and authorization service in cloud-based diagnostic imaging (DI) systems, and propose enhancements that allow for incorporating this technology within distributed enterprise environments. The objective of this study is to offer solutions for secure sharing of medical images among diagnostic imaging repository (DI-r) and heterogeneous picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) as well as Web-based and mobile clients in the cloud ecosystem. The main objective is to use OpenID Connect open-source single sign-on and authorization service and in a user-centric manner, while deploying DI-r and PACS to private or community clouds should provide equivalent security levels to traditional computing model. © 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)."
1114,Memory erasability amplification,"Erasable memory is an important resource for designing practical cryptographic protocols that are secure against adaptive attacks. Many practical memory devices such as solid state drives, hard disks, or file systems are not perfectly erasable because a deletion operation leaves traces of the deleted data in the system. A number of methods for constructing a large erasable memory from a small one, e.g., using encryption, have been proposed. Despite the importance of erasable memory in cryptography, no formal model has been proposed that allows one to formally analyse such memory constructions or cryptographic protocols relying on erasable memory. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we provide a formal model of erasable memory. A memory device allows a user to store, retrieve, and delete data, and it is characterised by a leakage function defining the extent to which erased data is still accessible to an adversary. Second, we investigate how the erasability of such memories can be amplified. We provide a number of constructions of memories with strong erasability guarantees from memories with weaker guarantees. One of these constructions of perfectly erasable memories from imperfectly erasable ones can be considered as the prototypical application of Canetti et al.’s All-or-Nothing Transform (AoNT). Motivated by this construction, we propose some new and better AoNTs that are either perfectly or computationally secure. These AoNTs are of possible independent interest. Third, we show (in the constructive cryptography framework) how the construction of erasable memory and its use in cryptographic protocols (for example to achieve adaptive security) can naturally be composed to obtain provable security of the overall protocol. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
1124,IoT-OAS: An oauth-based authorization service architecture for secure services in IoT scenarios,"Open authorization (OAuth) is an open protocol, which allows secure authorization in a simple and standardized way from third-party applications accessing online services, based on the representational state transfer (REST) web architecture. OAuth has been designed to provide an authorization layer, typically on top of a secure transport layer such as HTTPS. The Internet of Things (IoTs) refers to the interconnection of billions of resource-constrained devices, denoted as smart objects, in an Internet-like structure. Smart objects have limited processing/memory capabilities and operate in challenging environments, such as low-power and lossy networks. IP has been foreseen as the standard communication protocol for smart object interoperability. The Internet engineering task force constrained RESTful environments working group has defined the constrained application protocol (CoAP) as a generic web protocol for RESTful-constrained environments, targeting machine-to-machine applications, which maps to HTTP for integration with the existing web. In this paper, we propose an architecture targeting HTTP/CoAP services to provide an authorization framework, which can be integrated by invoking an external oauth-based authorization service (OAS). The overall architecture is denoted as IoT-OAS. We also present an overview of significant IoT application scenarios. The IoT-OAS architecture is meant to be flexible, highly configurable, and easy to integrate with existing services. Among the advantages achieved by delegating the authorization functionality, IoT scenarios benefit by: 1) lower processing load with respect to solutions, where access control is implemented on the smart object; 2) fine-grained (remote) customization of access policies; and 3) scalability, without the need to operate directly on the device. © 2014 IEEE."
1143,A punctured programming approach to adaptively secure functional encryption,"We propose the first construction for achieving adaptively secure functional encryption (FE) for poly-sized circuits (without complexity leveraging) from indistinguishability obfuscation (iO). Our reduction has polynomial loss to the underlying primitives. We develop a “punctured programming” approach to constructing and proving systems where outside of obfuscation we rely only on primitives realizable from pseudo random generators. Our work consists of two constructions. Our first FE construction is provably secure against any attacker that is limited to making all of its private key queries after it sees the challenge ciphertext. (This notion implies selective security.) Our construction makes use of an we introduce called puncturable deterministic encryption (PDE) which may be of independent interest. With this primitive in place we show a simple FE construction. We then provide a second construction that achieves adaptive security from indistinguishability obfuscation. Our central idea is to achieve an adaptively secure functional encryption by bootstrapping from a one bounded FE scheme that is adaptively secure. By using bootstrapping we can use “selective-ish” techniques at the outer level obfuscation level and push down the challenge of dealing with adaptive security to the one bounded FE scheme, where it has been already been solved. We combine our bootstrapping framework with a new “key signaling” technique to achieve our construction and proof. Altogether, we achieve the first construction and proof for adaptive security for functional encryption. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2015."
1149,Analysis of information security reliability: A tutorial,"This article presents a concise reliability analysis of network security abstracted from stochastic modeling, reliability, and queuing theories. Network security analysis is composed of threats, their impacts, and recovery of the failed systems. A unique framework with a collection of the key reliability models is presented here to guide the determination of the system reliability based on the strength of malicious acts and performance of the recovery processes. A unique model, called Attack-obstacle model, is also proposed here for analyzing systems with immunity growth features. Most computer science curricula do not contain courses in reliability modeling applicable to different areas of computer engineering. Hence, the topic of reliability analysis is often too diffuse to most computer engineers and researchers dealing with network security. This work is thus aimed at shedding some light on this issue, which can be useful in identifying models, their assumptions and practical parameters for estimating the reliability of threatened systems and for assessing the performance of recovery facilities. It can also be useful for the classification of processes and states regarding the reliability of information systems. Systems with stochastic behaviors undergoing queue operations and random state transitions can also benefit from the approaches presented here. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1151,Adaptive security for risk management using spatial data,"This paper presents the design principles for adaptive security for areas where changing conditions trigger events signaling risks that might require modifying authorizations of risk management teams. Spatial resources and information of the areas to be protected are considered in sample scenarios, and principles of security design are introduced building on ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control). Adaptivity of security rules applying to subjects who intervene in the risk area is the core of our security model so as to make it responsive to risks by dynamically granting privileges to subjects to access resources. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland."
1176,Verification and enforcement of access control policies,"Access control mechanisms protect critical resources of systems from unauthorized access. In a policy-based management approach, administrators define user privileges as rules that determine the conditions and the extent of users' access rights. As rules become more complex, analytical skills are required to identify conflicts and interactions within the rules that comprise a system policy - especially when rules are stateful and depend on event histories. Without adequate tool support such an analysis is error-prone and expensive. In consequence, many policy specifications are inconsistent or conflicting that render the system insecure. The security of the system, however, does not only depend on the correct specification of the security policy, but in a large part also on the correct interpretation of those rules by the system's enforcement mechanism. In this paper, we show how policy rules can be formalized in Fusion Logic, a temporal logic for the specification of behavior of systems. A symbolic decision procedure for Fusion Logic based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) is provided and we introduce a novel technique for the construction of enforcement mechanisms of access control policy rules that uses a BDD encoded enforcement automaton based on input traces which reflect state changes in the system. We provide examples of verification of policy rules, such as absence of conflicts, and dynamic separation of duty and of the enforcement of policies using our prototype implementation (FLCheck) for which we detail the underlying theory. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."
1197,Modeling and checking the security of DIFC system configurations,"Decentralized information flow control (DIFC) systems provide strong protection for data secrecy and integrity. However, the complicated configuration of information flow between system objects increases the chance of misconfiguration, making the system vulnerable to attackers. In this paper we first present a systematic analysis of misconfigurations and their security threats for DIFC systems. Then we define the security analysis problem for DIFC configurations based on a formal state-transition model, which allows model checkers to prove a configuration is secure or detect misconfigurations that violate the desired security goal. The experiment shows that bounded model checking techniques plus a novel preprocessing algorithm are effective in solving this problem. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013."
1203,Malware clearance for secure commitment of OS-level virtual machines,"A virtual machine(VM) can be simply created upon use and disposed upon the completion of the tasks or the detection of error. The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positives of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools. © 2013 IEEE."

1220,Some combinatorial results towards state recovery attack on RC4,"A stream cipher has an unobservable internal state that is updated in every step and a keystream output (bit or word) is generated at every state transition. State recovery attack on stream cipher attempts to recover the hidden internal state by observing the keystream. RC4 is a very widely used commercial stream cipher that has a huge internal state. No known state recovery attack on RC4 is feasible in practice and the best so far has a complexity of 2241 (Maximov et al., CRYPTO 2008). In this paper, we take a different approach to the problem. RC4 has a secret index j of size one byte. We perform a combinatorial analysis of the complexity of RC4 state recovery under the assumption that the values of j are known for several rounds. This assumption of knowledge of j is reasonable under some attack models, such as fault analysis, cache analysis, side channel attacks etc. Our objective is not to devise an unconditional full state recovery attack on RC4, but to investigate how much information of j leaks how much information of the internal state. In the process, we reveal a nice combinatorial structure of RC4 evolution and establish certain interesting results related to the complexity of state recovery. © 2011 Springer-Verlag."
1231,CaPaS: An optimal security-aware cache replacement algorithm for cluster storage systems,"In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic cache management approach, i.e., a cache partitioning system (CaPaS), to optimise security levels in contemporary cluster storage systems for data-intensive applications with acceptable disk response times. CaPaS utilises an adaptive security control mechanism to adjust for varying workload conditions initiated by client-issued disk requests as well as security requirements and contains a cache partitioning scheme, a response-time estimator, and an adaptive security quality controller. The CaPaS algorithm solves a non-linear optimisation problem to increase the quality of security of disk requests in cluster storage systems while ensuring the disk requests to be completed within their desired response times. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been tested with the newly defined performance indicators on a cluster storage system including CaPaS, eight cryptographic and seven integrity services. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the CaPaS algorithm improves the overall system performance enormously over two traditional baseline cache management algorithms. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
1277,A hierarchical reliability model of service-based software system,"Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) introduces a new paradigm where data, service, and the service composition logic are decoupled in an open environment. Software systems are built and evolved online by dynamic discovering and binding to the open services accessible through standard protocols. It requires new reliability modeling techniques to facilitate the analysis of dynamic collaborations and to be adaptable to the changes of service composition and system configuration at runtime. The paper proposes a hierarchical reliability model, in which the system reliability is calculated according to the layered superimposition of the reliabilities of data, services, fault-tolerant mechanism and service composition logic. At the basic-service layer, the service reliability is considered in the context of data reliability and service pools with backup alternatives. At the composition layer, a DTMC (Discrete Time Markov Chain) model is created for analyzing system reliability based on the reliability of the constituent services and their execution rate which are decided by the composite control structure and the operation scenarios. The DTMC state transition diagram can be automatically generated by analyzing and transforming the layered superimposition of the application following the transformation rules. The hierarchical modeling framework enables change adaptation at various levels. In addition, the models can be continuously learned and dynamically adjusted by profiling on the runtime monitoring log files. © 2009 IEEE."

However, the complexity of the logic can be prohibitive. We here develop a refined version of such a logic and associated tableau procedure with improved complexity but where important classes of specification can still be described. This new logic represents a combination of an ""exactly one"" temporal logic with an S5 multi-modal logic again restricted to the ""exactly one"" form. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg."
1289,Building test cases and oracles to automate the testing of web database applications,"Many organizations rely on web applications that use back-end databases to store important data. Testing such applications requires significant effort. Manual testing alone is often impractical, so testers also rely on automated testing techniques. However, current automated testing techniques may produce false positives (or false negatives) even in a perfectly working system because the outcome of a test case depends on the state of the database which changes over time as data is inserted and deleted. The Automatic Database Tester (AutoDBT) generates functional test cases that account for database updates. AutoDBT takes as input a model of the application and a set of testing criteria. The model consists of a state transition diagram that shows how users navigate pages, a data specification that captures how data flows, and an update specification that shows how the database is updated. AutoDBT generates guard queries to determine whether the database is in a state conducive to performing and evaluating tests. AutoDBT also generates partial oracles to help validate whether a back-end database is updated correctly during testing. This paper describes the design of AutoDBT, a prototype implementation, several experiments with the prototype, and four case studies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

This article focuses on the most common safety systems for managing process deviations during planned operating modes - instrumented safety systems (ISSs), such as safety alarms, safety controls, and safety instrumented systems.

1303,Cooperative intrusion detection model based on state transition analysis,"Many intrusion behaviors can be characterized as the execution of a sequence of crucial commands that results in an unauthorized access. Lots of attack sequences can be derived by either exchanging properly orders of crucial commands or replacing crucial commands with the functionally similar commands, which have the same performance. Therefore, it is very difficult to detect such attacks. In this paper, we propose a cooperative intrusion detection model based on state transition analysis, in which the topological order and isomorphic transformation are adopted. For a given sequence of crucial commands of an intrusion, all the possible derived sequences as an intrusion scenario can be generated by means of the model. We may also use the model to detect the attacks from different cooperating attackers and the attacks from one attacker in different login sessions. Furthermore, a derived intrusion can be seen as an unknown intrusion, in this sense that the technique presented in this paper can detect some unknown intrusions. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg."

TPM (trusted platform module) context manager is presented to carry out dynamic configuration management for virtual machine. It manages the TPM command requests and VM (virtual machine) configurations. The dynamic configuration representation method based on Merkle hash tree is explicitly proposed against TCG (trusted computing group) static configuration representation. It reflects the true VM status in real time even if the configuration has changed, and it eliminates the invalidation of configuration representation, sealing storage and remote attestation. TPM context manager supports TCG storage protection, remote attestation etc, which greatly enhances the security on trusted virtualization platform. © 2008 Wuhan University and Springer-Verlag GmbH."

1360,Adaptive security for multilevel ad hoc networks,"Secure communication is critical in military environments in which the network infrastructure is vulnerable to various attacks and compromises. A conventional centralized solution breaks down when the security servers are destroyed by the enemies. In this paper we design and evaluate a security framework for multilevel ad hoc wireless networks with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In battlefields, the framework adapts to the contingent damages on the network infrastructure. Depending on the availability of the network infrastructure, our design is composed of two modes. In infrastructure mode, security services, specifically the authentication services, are implemented on UAVs that feature low overhead and flexible managements. When the UAVs fail or are destroyed, our system seamlessly switches to infrastructureless mode, a backup mechanism that maintains comparable security services among the surviving units. In the infrastructureless mode, the security services are localized to each node's vicinity to comply with the ad hoc communication mechanism in the scenario. We study the instantiation of these two modes and the transitions between them. Our implementation and simulation measurements confirm the effectiveness of our design.

1362,The Oakland International Airport-BART connector project,"The Port of Oakland (Port), which owns and operates Oakland International Airport, and the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) have undertaken an effort to improve the transit connection between Oakland International Airport and the Coliseum BART Station, replacing the existing AirBART shuttle bus service. This improved transit connection, envisioned to be an automated people mover (APM) system, would interface with the proposed new terminal complex at the Airport, which is currently in the planning and schematic design phase. The paper discusses possible APM station locations in the proposed new terminal complex and evaluates each from a customer service perspective (walking distances, level changes, indoor versus outdoor/covered stations, etc.). The paper also discusses other planning considerations, such as airport security issues associated with possible APM rights-of-way and station locations. Copyright ASCE 2004."
1371,Autonomic protection system using adaptive security policy,"There are various techniques to safeguard computer systems and networks against illegal actions. Secure OS based on Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the systems that reflect these techniques. The RBAC system controls access to system resources based on roles. Recently, many systems employ more fine-grained access control on system resources to enhance system security. However, this approach in access control level may cause unexpected problems, since most systems acquire system resources through system call that is hooked on kernel. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The proposed Autonomic Protection System (APS) supports fine-grained intrusion detection. It resides above Secure OS based on RBAC that provides general-grained access control. The system detects intrusions using security policy based on RBAC model. The system performs double checking for intrusions using positive and negative intrusion detection policy. Additionally, as one of active responses, the system supports the self-adaptation of security policy depending on various computing environments. Therefore, the system can detect intrusions more accurately and respond to the attacks actively and appropriately. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004."
1372,Detecting Unknown Computer Viruses - A New Approach,"We give an overview of the tools to detect computer viruses without relying on ""pattern files"" that contain ""signatures"" of previously captured viruses. The system combines static code analysis with code simulation to identify malicious behaviors commonly found in computer viruses such as mass mailing, file infection, and registry overwrite. These prohibited behaviors are defined separately as security policies at the level of API library function calls in a state-transition like manner. The current tools target at Win32 binary viruses on Intel IA32 architectures and early experiments show that they can detect most email viruses that had spread in the wild in recent years. © Springer-Verlag 2004."
1415,A New Adaptative Security Protocol for UAV Network,"An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is a pilotless aerial vehicle which can be controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or remotely controlled by a pilot at the Ground Control Station (GCS). UAV and Ground Control Station (GCS) define a new form network, this kind of network persuade some specific characteristics as sufficient energy, network connectivity, mobility and network security. These specifications persuade difficult challenges for building a trustworthy and secure communication architecture solution. In this paper we present our new secure communication protocol taking into account the specifications of UAV network. This new architecture depends mostly on the definition of a secure protocol which provides authentication, confidentiality and integrity, in preserving network resources for effective data exchanged between UAV and GCS."
1432,Temporal Attack Detection in Multimodal Cyber-Physical Systems with Sticky HDP-HMM,"Modern and legacy cyber-physical systems produce logs of operational behavior from sensors to network traffic; analyzing these heterogeneous logs to consistently identify attack signals is a difficult problem. In this work, we propose a flexible temporal non-parametric Bayesian framework for identifying these attacks based on sticky Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (sHDP-HMM). The advantage of this approach is that it does not require detailed information on the system architecture, and it works for systems with unknown multimodal behavior, yielding interpretable inference. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework for accurate identification of attacks from cyber and physical attack vectors on two different CPS: an avionics testbed and a consumer robot. © 2022 CEUR-WS.

1456,A specification-based intrusion detection framework for cyber-physical environment in electric power system,"The emergence of high-speed networks in electric power systems creates a tight interaction of cyber infrastructure with the physical infrastructure and makes the power system susceptible to cyber penetration and attacks. To address this problem, this paper proposes an innovative approach to develop a specification-based intrusion detection framework that leverages available information provided by components in a contemporary power system. A Bayesian network is used to graphically encode the causal relations among the available information to create patterns with temporal state transitions, which are used as rules in the proposed intrusion detection framework. This allows the proposed framework to detect cyber attacks and classify different substation scenarios. A case study is provided for the non-pilot directional over current relay protection scheme for a modified 2-bus 2-generator system taken from a section of the IEEE 9-bus 3-generator system. Nine power system scenarios were developed and implemented as part of the case study. Each scenario was implemented on a test bed and all scenarios were correctly classified by the IDS built using the proposed methodology."
1467,The implementation of florida's TSM&O,"The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) has committed to manage and operate its entire multi-modal transportation system efficiently and effectively. Transportation funding remains limited and must be carefully allocated to meet agency objectives regarding safety, mobility, commerce, and environmental preservation through Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSM&O). The integrated program aims to optimize the performance of existing multi-modal infrastructure through implementation of systems, services, and projects to preserve capacity and improve the security, safety, and reliability of Florida's transportation system. The formal adoption of TSM&O created the program's foundation. As a decentralized agency FDOT is organized into a Central Office in Tallahassee that creates policy and procedure, and eight local Districts that plan and operate their systems. Immediate first steps included creation of leadership and task teams whose participants reflected Florida's diversity in population, geography, and demographics that would then guide and implement TSM&O actions."
1473,Effects of reliability and time pressure on unmanned aircraft systems operator performance,"Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are in the midst of aviation's next generation. UAS are being utilized at an increasing rate by military and security operations and are becoming widely popular in usage from search and rescue and weather research to homeland security and border patrol. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently working to define acceptable UAS performance standards and procedures for routine access for their use in the National Airspace System (NAS). This study examined the effects of system reliability and time pressure on unmanned aircraft systems operator performance and mental workload. Twenty-four undergraduate and graduate students, male and female, from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University participated in this study on a voluntary basis. The primary tasks were image processing time and target acquisition accuracy; three secondary tasks were concerned with responding to events encountered in typical UAS operations. Mental workload and trust levels of Multi-Modal Immersive Intelligent Interface for Remote Operation (MIIIRO) system were also studied and analyzed. System reliability was found to produce a significant effect for image processing time, while time pressure produced a significant effect for target acquisition accuracy. A significant effect was found for the interaction between system reliability and time pressure for pop-up threats re-routing processing time. The results were examined and recommendations for future research are discussed."
