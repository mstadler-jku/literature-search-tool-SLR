Zhaoshun,10.1109/CCI.2016.7778962,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778962,20160.0,IEEE Conferences,"The hype over cloud computing cannot go unnoticed even as providers and users alike testify of the evident benefits. It also goes without saying that this approach to computing shares its own challenges the most echoed being security. Security concerns herein, birthed by the exposure of the cloud to different threats, continue to cast doubts on potential users and it's only befitting that such concerns are addressed. Users who entrust their data to the cloud want their data to be secured in the strongest terms possible. Once data leaves the user, the onus is on the cloud provider to provide the required security since data now lies within their perimeter of jurisdiction. But security requirements do change with time and this therefore calls for a continuous process of evaluating the security status of the cloud system. This paper proposes a model of analyzing the security status of the cloud system with regards confidentiality, integrity and availability. We employ state transitions of a conceptual finite state machine, Boolean algebra and logic to evaluate the various states of the system when a specified breach occurs. The scope of this paper is limited to user data on the cloud and not as it traverses the network between the user and the provider.",IEEE Xplore,2016 First IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet (ICCCI),1

The recent articles indicate that Ormon PLCs used Fins Ethernet protocol were exposed to mode-switching malicious network attack. However, the traditional detection methods based on function codes and Snort detection rules could not get an ideal result.

State transition diagrams, the graphical representation of penetrations, identify precisely the requirements for and the compromise of a penetration and present only the critical events that must occur for the successful completion of the penetration. State transition diagrams are written to correspond to the states of an actual computer system, and these diagrams form the basis of a rule based expert system for detecting penetrations, called the state transition analysis tool (STAT).

For each Unix process, the user credentials, which are user identifiers, determine the process privilege, including whether a process has gained a high privilege, such as that of the superuser. The state transition technique is applied to a suitably defined process state, identified by certain classes of user credential values. A transition takes place when these values change from one class to another. These states are clearly defined, and prohibited state transitions as well as some supporting rules are identified. When many break-ins succeed, either the rules are violated or these prohibited transitions occur, and this implies a violation of system security policy. A specially modified system call, ktrace0, is used by the superuser to monitor the process-state and state transition analysis is applied to the traced information, by the Intrusion Detection System. Tests show that most known security violations belonging to the targeted classes (such as buffer overflow exploits) can be detected (and possibly pre-empted) while the constituent activities are still being processed in the kernel.",IEEE Xplore,Proceedings 15th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC'99),6

Therefore, many researches related to the malware propagation and suppression have been proposed to protect the topology and system security of wireless multimedia network. In these studies, the epidemic model is of great significance to the analysis of malware propagation. Considering the cloud and state transition of sensor nodes, a cloud-assisted model for malware detection and the dynamic differential game against malware propagation are proposed in this paper. Firstly, a SVM based malware detection model is constructed with the data sharing at the security platform in the cloud. Then the number of malware-infected nodes with physical infectivity to susceptible nodes is calculated precisely based on the attributes of WMS transmission. Then the state transition among WMS devices is defined by the modified epidemic model. Furthermore, a dynamic differential game and target cost function are successively derived for the Nash equilibrium between malware and WMS system. On this basis, a saddle-point malware detection and suppression algorithm is presented depending on the modified epidemic model and the computation of optimal strategies.

The obfuscation scheme is based on modifying the state transition function of a given circuit by expanding its reachable state space and enabling it to operate in two distinct modes - the normal mode and the obfuscated mode. Such a modification obfuscates the rareness of the internal circuit nodes, thus making it difficult for an adversary to insert hard-to-detect Trojans. It also makes some inserted Trojans benign by making them activate only in the obfuscated mode. The combined effect leads to higher Trojan detectability and higher level of protection against such attack.

Software that heavily interacts with the underlying OS (e.g., I/O intensive and event-driven applications) suffers from system call overhead. To deteriorate this situation, security vulnerabilities in modern processors have prompted kernel mitigations that further increase the transition overhead. Particularly system-call-heavy applications have been reported to be slowed down by up to 30% with kernel page-table isolation (KPTI), the widely deployed mitigation for the Meltdown vulnerability. To decouple system calls from mode transitions, we revisit an old idea known as system-call batching or multi-calls: the bundling of system calls into a combined call, which only incurs the mode-transition costs of a single one. And then, we have implemented ESCA scheme to adapt system-call batching to Linux-based servers in the light of Meltdown and Spectre, effectively eliminating the slowdown of KPTI-affected applications. Our evaluation shows that the throughputs of real-world applications, benefiting from ESCA, can be improved with only 2 lines of code changed respectively: Nginx by up to 12%, lighttpd by up to 23%, and Redis by 4%.

An anti-attack switched event-triggered mechanism (ATASETM) is designed by considering the impact of ADoS attacks on the systems. Based on the mechanism, the entire time interval is split into rest intervals, continuous detection intervals, residual intervals, and ADoS active-attack intervals. The closed-loop system (CLS) is represented as a three-mode switched system by merging these intervals. Subsequently, a three-piecewise Lyapunov function is constructed for fewer conservative criteria to ensure that the CLS is $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ exponentially stable. An exact expression of the relationship between the decay rate and length of the dormant- and active-attack intervals is obtained. On the basis of the proposed criteria, a joint-design strategy is developed in terms of linear matrix inequalities for the desired trigger matrix and feedback gain. Lastly, a satellite control system and an inverted pendulum model are used to validate the ATASETM-based stability analysis and $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ security control approaches. Numerical results demonstrate that the maximum allowable exponential decay rate decreases with increasing attack time (and vice versa), and the optimal $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ performance level becomes worse as the attack time or the difficulty of the event triggering increases.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,37

Therefore, the use of reasonable spare inventory strategy, as well as maintenance and support decisions to systems is essential to improve system availability, security and system cost reducing. Maintenance strategy can be formulated based on the situation in which the products are monitored. For a single-component system, current research around its multi-state transferring have been quite mature, in which the conversion rate defined in a different state in Markov process can be clearly showed by conversion relationship between different state. However, the state transition process involved mostly considers the processes of repairing only, and rarely considers the impact to system availability by the transition of failure rate caused by changes in components, spare replacement strategies and spare supply. To solve this problem, this paper considered a single-component system with two derating states, and discussed its steady-state availability through variable spare replacement probability and different spare fill rate levels. With model of the system with two derating states established, generalized Markov method was used to solve the relationships between replacement timing and system availability with the level of spare fill rate considered.

Recent studies have revealed that control programs running on CPS devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g., code-injection or code-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks). Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime data-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics checking. In this work, we propose Orpheus, a new security methodology for defending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution semantics. We first present a general method for reasoning cyber-physical execution semantics of a control program (i.e., causal dependencies between the physical context/event and program control flows), including the event identification and dependence analysis. As an instantiation of Orpheus, we then present a new program behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton (eFSA). eFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of CPS control programs and incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented exploits if a specific physical event is missing along with the corresponding event dependent state transition. We evaluate our prototype's performance by conducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that eFSA can successfully detect different runtime attacks.

SIP being a text-based protocol is vulnerable to a range of denial of service (DoS) attacks. These DoS attacks can render the SIP servers/SIP proxy servers unusable by depleting memory and CPU time. In this paper, we consider two types of DoS attacks, namely, flooding attacks and coordinated attacks for detection. Flooding attacks affect both stateless and stateful SIP servers while coordinated attacks affect stateful SIP servers. We model the SIP operation as discrete event system (DES) and design a new state transition machine, which we name as probabilistic counting deterministic timed automata (PCDTA) to describe the behavior of SIP operations. We also identify different types of anomalies that can occur in a DES model, which appear in the form of illegal transitions, violating timing constraints, and appear in number which is otherwise not seen. Subsequently, we map various DoS attacks in SIP to a type of anomaly in DES. PCDTA can learn probabilities of various transitions and timings delay from a set of nonmalicious training sequences. A trained PCDTA can detect anomalies, and hence various DoS attacks in SIP. We perform a thorough experiment with computer simulated SIP traffic and report the detection performance of PCDTA on various attacks generated through custom scripts.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,51

In particular, the adopted security protection mechanisms often depend on the node state, location, and/or surrounding risk, which need the capability of context-aware security quantification. This paper views the security level as a user's inherent property that is only correlated with the user's behaviours and the situated context and independent of the suffered attack ways. We propose a formalized methodology to especially quantify the security level in real time from the perspective of state transition probability through estimating the stable probability of staying in the security state in inhomogeneous continuous time Markov chain. This paradigm enables users to customize the security protection mechanisms for adapting to the frequently varying context. We conduct the extensive numerical calculations and empirical analysis to comprehensively investigate the response of the proposed security quantification framework to the various combinations of the concerned parameters, e.g., SNR, velocity, and traffic flow. The results show that the proposed framework is capable of capturing the real-time security level adaptively to the vehicular context and provides a dependable decision basis to security protection, which can restrict the security to a target value.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Access,52

As the attacks become more variable and complex, there is an urgent need for dynamic defense methods. In this paper, we propose a security function virtualization (SFV) based moving target defense of SDSG which makes the attack surface constantly changing. First, we design a dynamic defense mechanism by migrating virtual security function (VSF) instances as the traffic state changes. The centralized SDN controller is re-designed for global status monitoring and migration management. Moreover, we formalize the VSF instances migration problem as an integer nonlinear programming problem with multiple constraints and design a pre-migration algorithm to prevent VSF instances' resources from being exhausted.

Then, strategies of cyber attacker and defender can be studied, which help to identify substations vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In this paper, a successful intrusion is regarded as a probabilistic event related to reconnaissance activities. Its probability can be approximated by the Poisson distribution of the number of vulnerabilities discovered by the attacker. Furthermore, models of intrusion and defense in competition for control of the substations are proposed using Markov decision process (MDP). Key characteristics of target substation, attacker and defender are considered for determining probabilistic state transitions related to intrusion and defense actions. Thus, by solving the MDP models, the optimal strategies (action policies) of both the attacker and defender can be obtained. With these optimal strategies, the cyber security status of a substation can be evaluated within varied time frames.

RESTful API has gained popularity in recent years due to its reusability, flexibility and natural adaptation to modern web application, mobile application, and cloud computing. However, ensuring secure API/data access and hence mitigating reputational and/or financial damage to the organization is still in its early stage.

Unfortunately, as of today, there are no good solutions available that can provide very fast and accurate extraction of FSMs from the flattened netlist to perform effective security assessment. The difficulty of developing such a solution lies in precisely identifying FSM state flip-flops present in a netlist that contains numerous circuit flip-flops.

FSMx utilizes graph theory to identify FSM state registers from other registers. FSMx automatically extracts gate-level state transition graphs (STGs) for each of the detected FSM state registers.

To mimic an attacker’s behavior, a Dolev-Yao adversary model was constructed in the 5G model by empowering it with NAS signalling security testing knowledge and reasonable security capabilities in the wireless channel. Then we used the TAMARIN prover to verify all the abstracted properties one by one and discovered some protocol vulnerabilities based on the counterexamples found. We further verified these vulnerabilities on the testbed and identified 10 new 5G protocol vulnerabilities. Moreover, we analyzed the root cause of these vulnerabilities and concluded that all of them were caused by the unconditional trust between UE and gNodeB. Therefore, we propose an improved PKI mechanism based on the existing asymmetric encryption of 5G. Besides the existing public-private key pair of the home network, we introduce a new pair of asymmetric keys in the gNodeB to encrypt and sign the signalling message sent to UE. The gNodeB can be connected only when the verification succeeds and then the RRC connection can be initiated.

P-Med makes use of the nondeterministic transition characteristic of NFA to flexibly represent medical model, which includes illness states, treatment methods and state transitions caused by exerting different treatment methods. A medical model is encrypted and outsourced to cloud to deliver telemedicine service. Using P-Med, patient-centric diagnosis and treatment can be made on-the-fly while protecting the confidentiality of patient’s illness states and treatment recommendation results. Moreover, a new privacy-preserving NFA evaluation method is given in P-Med to get a confidential match result for the evaluation of an encrypted NFA and an encrypted data set, which avoids the cumbersome inner state transition determination. We demonstrate that P-Med realizes treatment procedure recommendation without privacy leakage to unauthorized parties.

Yu,10.1109/TCAD.2017.2697960,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7911190,20180.0,IEEE Journals,"The emerging security threats in the integrated circuit supply chain do not only challenge the chip integrity, but also raise serious concerns on hardware intellectual property (IP) piracy. Hardware design obfuscation is a promising countermeasure to resist reverse engineering attacks and IP piracy. The majority of existing hardware obfuscation methods modify the original finite state machine (FSM) by adding additional state transitions and utilizing a key sequence to lock the transition from the nonfunctional states to the functional reset state. Those methods are effective to prevent attackers from entering the normal functional mode but they lack resilience if the FSM is already in the normal mode. This paper proposes to protect all the states with a low-cost state-deflection-based obfuscation method, which dynamically deflects state transitions from the original transition path to a black hole cluster if a wrong key is applied. Unlike other works that use static transitions between legal states to black hole states at the design time, this method utilizes a state rotation function (Rotatefunc) and selective register flipping function (Mapfunc) to dynamically control the state deflection paths. Hence, the difficulty of reverse engineering and thwarting register overwrite attacks is increased. Simulations performed on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits show that the proposed method significantly reduces the difference of the net toggle activities between the correct and wrong key scenarios, and achieves up to 56% higher code coverage than the most efficient obfuscation method. Thanks to the dynamic deflection feature, on average, this method generates about 100 more unique state register patterns than other methods with moderate power increase. Moreover, the proposed method achieves the Hamming distance of primary outputs and state registers close to 50%.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,97

By introducing the maximum entropy (MaxENT) models into the rule optimization for the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model, this paper proposes an improved BLP model with the self-learning function: MaxENT-BLP. This model first formalizes the security properties, system states, transformational rules, and a constraint model based on the states transition of the MaxENT. After handling the historical system access logs as the original data sets, this model extracts the user requests, current states, and decisions to act as the feature vectors. Second, we use k -fold cross validation to divide all vectors into a training set and a testing set. In this paper, the model training process is based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. And this model contains a strategy update algorithm to adjust the access control rules dynamically according to the access and decision records in a system. Third, we prove that MaxENT-BLP is secure through theoretical analysis. By estimating the precision, recall, and F1-score, the experiments show the availability and accuracy of this model. Finally, this paper provides the process of model training based on deep learning and discussions regarding adversarial samples from the malware classifiers.

Petri net as an important formal tool for modeling, analysis and analysis of distributed, parallel and real-time systems provides a solid foundation for CPS modeling. However, Petri nets lack the ability to describe spatial information, so it is impossible to fully model CPS. Incorrect system modeling can directly affect system reliability and even life-threatening and property safety, Therefore, when modeling and analyzing CPS characteristics, a more complete modeling method is needed. This paper extends the Defect extension time Petri net and constructs a spatiotemporal Petri net that can describe the positional changes of CPS physical entities.

The fact that model checking approaches are sometimes problematic motivates us to further examine the alternative approach of theorem proving. Theorem proving, in general, is a difficult task; however the regular structure of the proof obligations generated from SCR specifications suggests that relatively unsophisticated theorem provers can discharge many of these obligations. As a feasibility study, we use the B-Toolkit to detect safety violations in an example SCR specification. The B-Toolkit is a good choice because it is commercially available and Supports verified refinement to executables in a commercial programming language (C). We convert the mode transition table in the example SCR specification to an AMN (Abstract Machine Notation) specification and analyze the result with the B-Toolkit. The B-Toolkit generates 120 proof obligations of which 113 are automatically discharged by the theorem prover. The remaining 7 proof obligations are, in fact, not theorems and correspond to the 3 problems in the SCR specification detected by the model checking approaches. For the corrected SCR specification, the B-Toolkit automatically discharges all proof obligations.

Peers then simulate the execution and send back the endorsed data to the client i.e. API gateway. Collected endorsement from various peers are sent to orderer which then build a block containing an ordered transactions received from all clients and then broadcast that block to all peers.

However, due to the inherent mechanical energy consumption and the long-range signal propagation pathloss, the traditional cruising and hovering UAV relay modes are deficient in energy utilization and secrecy rate, respectively. Modeling of the secrecy energy efficiency with respect to UAV mode adaptation is limited in the literature and deserves further investigation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secrecy rate-energy efficient UAV relay mode adaptation scheme for secure wireless communications scenarios where the eavesdropping locations are known, i.e., the eavesdropper is a hijacked internal legitimate node. In this secure system, the UAV cooperatively assists the legitimate transmissions and injects artificial interference to the eavesdropper. We investigate optimum UAV placement and relay period planning for the hovering and the cruising relay modes, respectively. By modeling the UAV modes transfer and maximizing the secrecy energy efficiency, the optimum mode adaptation ratios are obtained under both the secrecy rate-prioritized and the energy-saving criteria. In addition, the proposed UAV relay mode adaptation mechanism is further studied for each UAV task division, to adapt to the dynamic channel variations and enhance the security. Our theoretical analysis shows that the mode adaptation ratio is determined by the secrecy rate-energy gain between the cruising and the hovering modes, and by the energy consumption threshold of the UAV relays.

Focusing on signal processing techniques, this article introduces an adaptive scheme on detection of injected bad data at the control center. This scheme takes the power measurements of two sequential data collection slots into account, and detects data injection attacks by monitoring the measurement variations and state changes between the two time slots. The proposed scheme has the capability of adaptively detecting attacks including both non-stealthy attacks and stealthy attacks. Stealthy attacks are proved impossible to detect using conventional residual- based methods, and can cause more dangerous effects on power systems than non-stealthy attacks.

Next, we show how to construct a model for vulnerability evaluations, which can represent the behavior of a cloud system in the occurrence of faults or during the execution of operations. The cloud system model consists of state transition models for components of a system with interdependency relationships. In this model, state transitions in a component invoked by the executions of configuration change operations or the occurrences of component faults can trigger state transitions in other components due to the dependency between these components. Using this model, we analyze the propagation of the fault's effect between components having interdependencies.

User position is also considered when various access points changed states. Moreover, the algorithm also verifies the legitimacy of a fire alarm by measuring the change in temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide levels, thus defending against manipulative attackers. The experiment conducted in this paper used a combination of sensors, microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi and ZigBee communication to identify user behavior at various access points and implement the logical sensing algorithm.

The evolutionary properties of viruses are taken into account in the model by the formal rule that previously immunized or cured nodes, at some interval (the size of which is the model parameter), can be re-infected, and exposure of antivirus protection has a lag time (also is a model parameter). In this model, it was accepted that any network node could be in one of three states: in a protected (immunized) state; in an infected state; in a neutral state. In a neutral state, the node may be infected or immunized. In an immunized state, the node can send out antiviruses, which cures infected and immunizes neutral nodes. In this state, copies of antiviruses (useful viruses) are sent out to the nodes of the network randomly chosen (random choice in the address space indicates of the stochastic behavior). In an infected state, the node can send out copies of viruses to nodes in the network, also by randomly selecting in the address space (this also shows the stochastic behavior). The stochastic dynamics model of the spread of evolving viruses in the computer network was described graphically using a diagram of possible transitions between nodes states which allow one to create a system of kinetic differential equations describing these processes. One of the advantages of the model being developed is the ability to modify and expand it by creating more complex state change graphs and transitions between them. This provides supplementing the system of kinetic equations with a member that considers the overall increasing in the number of users and devices in computer networks over time that can be described by a function of any kind.",IEEE Xplore,2019 XXI International Conference Complex Systems: Control and Modeling Problems (CSCMP),120

The physical layer usually consists of the power grid and protection devices whereas the cyber layer consists of communication, and computation and control components. Combining components of the cyber layer in one layer complicates the process of modeling intra-actions because each component has different failure modes. On the other hand, dividing the cyber layers into a large number of sub-layers may unnecessarily increase the number of system states and increase the computational burden. In this paper, we classify system layers based on their common, coupled, and shared functions. Also, interactions between the classified layers are identified, characterized, and clustered based on their impact on the system. Furthermore, based on the overall function of each layer and types of its components, intra-actions within layers are characterized.

In the prior-art grid resilience studies, the hurricanes or wildfires are mainly defended in terms of expected line damages, while they are prone to trigger short-circuit fault (SCF) evolved with dynamic influence in reality. In this paper, a fragile model is developed to evaluate the nodal SCF probability considering the insulation aging of equipment and extreme weather condition. Then, a response framework for extreme weather events is developed for a transmission system to defend the cascading impacts of expected SCFs. Specifically, switches are shifted to restrain the out-of-range short-circuit currents (SCCs) so that to ensure the SCFs can be removed by circuit breakers, generation rescheduling and load shedding are arranged to maintain the post-fault system transient stability. The above measures are optimized simultaneously by an integrated Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP). Considering the error or uncertainty of weather event forecasts, a multi-state model is established to provide the most cost-effective grid resilience enhancement scheme, in which the expected urgent adaptions of the initial scheme subject to weather state transition is included in the overall cost.

Since it stores the system states and controls system functionality, security vulnerabilities of FSM have been exploited extensively. Among the potential attacks, fault inject attack (FIA) is one of the most severe and most challenging to defend against. Unlike existing countermeasures, we propose a novel structure for FSM state flip flop design that can mitigate any kind of timing based FIAs. Our key idea is to sample the flip flop input signals multiple times during one clock cycle, and then compare these values to determine the correct one. This can effectively defeat all the FIAs based on violating FSM state setup time constraint. In addition, such design will make the design more robust against jitters. In order to reduce the design overhead, we use the low-cost transmission gates to implement the proposed latch and flip flop. We use Hspice to simulate the error conditions with delayed input data and jitter and the results confirm that our design is error resilient. We also implement the FSM in AES with our proposed flip flops and compare the area overhead with existing FIA countermeasures.

The result is a new paradigm known as distributed trust; this article attempts to survey that landscape. ""Divide and conquer"" can be a powerful tool for disentangling complexity when designing a computing system. However, some aspects of system design are inseparable. Treating these as though they were independent leads to one interfering with the other, and ""divide and be conquered"" perhaps better characterizes the consequences. For some years, we have been investigating how to construct systems that continue functioning despite component failures and attacks. A question we have pondered is to what extent does divide and conquer apply? Somewhat less than you might hope is, unfortunately, the answer. One could argue that attacks can be seen as just another cause for component failure. The Byzantine fault model asserts that a faulty component can exhibit arbitrarily malicious (so-called ""Byzantine"") behavior; a system that tolerates Byzantine faults should then be able to handle anything. Moreover, because any component can be viewed abstractly in terms of its state and a set of possible next-state transitions - in short, a state machine - fault-tolerant services can be built by assembling enough state-machine copies so that outputs from the ones exhibiting Byzantine behavior are outvoted by the correctly functioning ones. The fault-tolerance of the ensemble thus exceeds the fault-tolerance of any individual state machine, and a distributed fault-tolerance is the result. A closer look at such replicated state machines, however, reveals problems ""when attacks are possible. Specific difficulties with the approach and how we can overcome these are described later in this article, but the overall vision remains compelling: place more trust in an ensemble than in any of its individual components. In analogy with distributed fault-tolerance, then, we are seeking ways to implement distributed trust.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Security & Privacy,129

This paper presents a backup allocation model in which a function can be protected by two backup servers and a backup server can protect multiple functions under a shared protection strategy to minimize the maximum unavailability among functions. We use Markov chains to analyze the state transitions and make equilibrium-state equations. By solving them, we obtain the probability of each state of the allocation and compute an unavailability of function. We introduce two algorithms to examine the proposed model; one of them uses the performance bound of the maximum unavailability which is analyzed in this paper.

However, the state transition table (STT) of a large-scale DBSM AC-DFA can span hundreds of megabytes of system memory, whose limited bandwidth and long latency could become the performance bottleneck We propose a novel partitioning algorithm which converts an AC-DFA into a ¿head¿ and a ¿body¿ parts.

A large number of applications relate to cellular and mobile telephony, pagers, local area networks, cordless phones, global positioning systems (GPS), and security systems. Pseudo-SAW (PSAW) and high velocity PSAW (HVPSAW) have received great attention because of their high phase velocities and, therefore, the high frequencies of operation that these modes provide. In addition to high phase velocities, the pseudomodes must also present low propagation losses and considerably high electromechanical coupling coefficients to be considered for surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. This paper verifies that the metallic layer thickness is a relevant SAW device parameter, which must be considered to achieve lower losses for high frequency, low loss SAW devices. Popular PSAW and HVPSAW material orientations, such as 64/spl deg/ YX LiNbO/sub 3/ (0/spl deg/-26/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), 36/spl deg/ YX LiTaO/sub 3/ (0/spl deg/ -54/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), LiNbO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 36/spl deg/), LiTaO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 31/spl deg/), and Li/sub 2/B/sub 4/O/sub 7/ (0/spl deg/ 47.3/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/), are considered as examples. In addition to the reduced loss analysis and the dispersion analysis for the pseudo modes, the present work discusses the transitions with respect to the layer thickness from the PSAWs and HVPSAWs to the generalized SAWs (GSAWs) and Rayleigh (sagittal particle motion) modes. In addition to contributing to the knowledge of the pseudomodes behavior with layer thickness, this mode transition analysis enlightens the situation in which the losses in the pseudo modes go to zero because of the merging of the pseudo modes into the SAWs (GSAWs and Rayleigh).

Given the mounting cyber-attack threats, these critical ICT systems create great security issues for smart grids. Additionally, the clever attackers have the ability to not only access and monitor the smart grid, but also hack it by launching well-established cyber-attacks. Thus, this article is devoted to understanding the potential stealthy cyber-attack and its countermeasure. First, this article proposes a stealthy sparse cyber-attack model in an ac smart grid by considering both the residual test-based detector and the interval-state-estimation-based detector, which is not considered in previous studies. The design model is formulated as a constrained optimization problem by minimizing the number of contaminated meters, where the characteristics of two types of detector are considered simultaneously as the constraints for the first time. A constrained differential evolution (CDE) is proposed as the solver because the optimization problem is NP-hard. Then, a generalized-cumulative-sum-based detector is developed to detect the proposed cyber-attacks, where a fractional-order state transition matrix is originally introduced into the estimator to describe the dynamics of the power system. Numerical studies illustrate the feasibility of CDE-based stealthy sparse cyber-attacks and the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasure.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,136

In any hybrid security system, the human portion needs to trust the machine portion. To do so, both must understand the expected behavior for every state‐how the system can fail and what those failures look like. The machine must be able to communicate its state and have the capacity to alert the humans when an expected state transition doesn't happen as expected. Things will go wrong, either by accident or as the result of an attack, and the humans are going to need to troubleshoot the system in real time‐that requires understanding on both parts. Each time things go wrong, and the machine portion doesn't communicate well, the human portion trusts it a little less. Humans and machines have different strengths. Humans are flexible and can do creative thinking in ways that machines cannot. But they're easily fooled. Machines are more rigid and can handle state changes and process flows much better than humans can.

Prior works have shown that traffic attributes such as packet size combined with machine learning techniques enable the inference of private information from Internet of Things users. One of the commonly used techniques to mitigate those privacy threats is traffic obfuscation, such as packet padding. Most padding mechanisms that were previously proposed statically select the number of bytes inserted in the packets, which incurs high overhead and ineffective privacy improvement. These static mechanisms are particularly unsuitable for networks whose traffic patterns are significantly dynamic, such as smart homes. This article proposes an adaptive packet padding approach based on software-defined networking (SDN) that adjusts the number of bytes inserted into packets in response to variations in the home network utilization. The proposed technique monitors the network to instruct a padding mechanism through a representational state transfer (REST) interface proposed in this article. This mechanism ensures that the length of packets generated by connected devices is modified. The evaluation includes four supervised learning mechanisms, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and k-nearest neighbors (KNNs), to measure privacy improvement through the metrics accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Goodput, jitter, and packet loss induced by the proposal are also evaluated. Our proposal is shown to overcome the state-of-the-art solutions in privacy preservation with a significantly lower overhead. For instance, the accuracy of RF on identifying devices decreases from 96% to 4.96%.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,141

With this increase in unknown cyber risks, the demand for cyber insurance is increasing. One of the most serious emerging risks is the silent cyber risk, and it is likely to increase in the future. However, at present, security measures against silent cyber risks are insufficient. In this study, we conducted a risk management of silent cyber risk for organizations with the objective of contributing to the development of risk management methods for new cyber risks that are expected to increase in the future. Specifically, we modeled silent cyber risk by focusing on state transitions to different risks. We newly defined two types of silent cyber risk, namely, Alteration risk and Combination risk, and conducted risk assessment. Our assessment identified 23 risk factors, and after analyzing them, we found that all of them were classified as Risk Transference. We clarified that the most effective risk countermeasure for Alteration risk was insurance and for Combination risk was measures to reduce the impact of the risk factors themselves. Our evaluation showed that the silent cyber risk could be reduced by about 50%, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasures.",IEEE Xplore,2021 10th International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics (IIAI-AAI),142

A large number of applications relate to cellular and mobile telephony, pagers, local area networks, cordless phones, global positioning systems, and security systems. Pseudo-SAW (PSAW) and more recently the High Velocity Pseudo-SAW (HVPSAW) have received a great deal of attention due to their high phase velocities, and therefore the high frequencies of operation these modes may provide. In addition to high phase velocities, the pseudo-modes must also present low propagation losses and considerably high electromechanical coupling coefficients to be considered for practical devices. This paper verifies that the metallic layer thickness is a relevant SAW device parameter in order to achieve lower losses, for high frequency, high electromechanical coupling, low loss SAW devices. Popular PSAW and HVPSAW material orientations such as 64/spl deg/ YX LiNbO/sub 3/(0/spl deg/ 26/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), 36/spl deg/ YX LiTaO/sub 3/ (0/spl deg/-54/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), LiNbO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 36/spl deg/), LiTaO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 31/spl deg/), quartz ST-X (0/spl deg/ 132.75/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), Li/sub 2/B/sub 4/O/sub 7/ (0/spl deg/ 45/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/), among others, are considered. In addition to the lower losses and the dispersion analysis for the pseudo modes, the present work discusses the transitions with layer thickness from HVPSAWs to higher order PSAWs modes, and the transitions from PSAWs to the generalized SAWs (GSAWs) modes. Besides contributing to the knowledge of the pseudo-modes behavior with layer thickness, this mode transition analysis enlightens the situation where the losses in the pseudo modes go to zero, due to the merging of the pseudo modes into the GSAWs. The fact that as a function of thickness the GSAWs are a natural continuation for the pseudo modes may be conveniently used in the fabrication of low loss devices. For completeness the effects of heavy layer metals, such as gold, in reducing the layer thickness where the pseudo modes merge to the GSAWs are discussed. Numerical results are compared to some experimental data available in the literature, and the present analysis elucidates experimentally observed higher order pseudo modes, and values of layer thickness where lower losses are achieved.",IEEE Xplore,1997 IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings.

The motivating factors are device and user mobility, i.e., to let the user determine where application components should execute at all times. In order to organize and locate roaming devices, a decentralized peer-to-peer overlay is developed. To provide location transparency for application developers and enable efficient data sharing among application components, an API is provided that hides whether shared memory or latency optimized network distribution is used to share data. The problem of open TCP connections to third-party applications is solved with a proxy-based approach. Multimedia applications are especially sensitive to service interruptions that can be caused by migration, and a new approach for check-pointing, state transfer, and resuming an application with minimal freeze time is therefore introduced. The evaluation of TRAMP shows that this optimization for low freeze time has significant effect. For example, migrating the Skype video-conferencing application with TRAMP reduces the average freeze time from 41.1 seconds with legacy approaches to 213 milliseconds.

To ensure vehicle ABS security, we propose an attack detection method to accurately detect both sensor attack and CAN bus attack in a vehicle ABS, and an attack mitigation strategy to mitigate their negative effects on the vehicle ABS. In our attack detection method, we build a vehicle state space equation which considers real-time road friction coefficient to predict vehicle states (i.e., wheel speed and longitudinal brake force) with their previous values. Based on sets of historical measured vehicle states, we develop a search algorithm to find out attack changes (vehicle state changes because of the attack) by minimizing errors between predicted vehicle states and measured vehicle states. In our attack mitigation strategy, attack changes are subtracted from measured vehicle states to generate correct vehicle states for the vehicle ABS. We conducted first real sensor attack experiments to show how a magnet affects sensor readings. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack detection method can detect sensor attack and CAN bus attack more accurately compared with existing methods, and also our attack mitigation strategy almost eliminates attack's effects on the vehicle ABS.",IEEE Xplore,2020 29th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN),146

The only proper way to protect a smart contract is to fix potential risks in its code before it is deployed to the blockchain. However, existing tools for smart contract security analysis focus on the detection of bugs but seldom consider the code fix issues. Meanwhile, it is often time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to understand and fix flawed code manually. In this paper we propose SMARTSHIELD, a bytecode rectification system, to fix three typical security-related bugs (i.e., state changes after external calls, missing checks for out-of-bound arithmetic operations, and missing checks for failing external calls) in smart contracts automatically and help developers release secure contracts. Moreover, SMARTSHIELD guarantees that the rectified contract is not only immune to certain attacks but also gas-friendly (i.e., a slightly increase of gas cost). To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of SMARTSHIELD, we applied it to 28,621 real-world buggy contracts on Ethereum blockchain (as of January 2nd2019). Experiment results demonstrated that among 95,502 insecure cases in those contracts, 87,346 (91.5%) of them were automatically fixed by SMARTSHIELD. A following test with both program analysis and real-world exploits further testified that the rectified contracts were secure against common attacks.

The state transitions are managed by added signals that may come from various triggers depending on the target application. We devise an algorithm for implementing the N-variant IC design. We discuss the necessary manipulations of the added signals that would facilitate the various tasks. The key advantage to integrating the heterogeneity in the functional specification of the design is that we can configure the variants during or post-manufacturing, but removal, extraction or deletion of the variants is not viable. Experimental results on benchmark circuits demonstrate that the method can be automatically and efficiently implemented. Because of its lightweight, N-variant design is particularly well-suited for securing embedded systems.

However, their complex signaling procedures and limited soft capacity made them vulnerable to new denial-of-service (DoS) attacks involving the control plane. More importantly, this type of frauds can also affect the successors of the 3G and their related paradigms such as smart cities. In this paper, we deeply examine the considerable signaling load of the IDLE-DCH state transitions that can be exploited by malicious entities to launch signaling DoS attacks. Besides, we investigate some state-of-art techniques proposed to combat the signaling attacks. A comparative analysis between these solutions has been conducted with regard to three pertinent criteria: cost, efficiency and overhead. The summary of results indicates that even though the randomization experiences some flaws related to the radio channel consumption, it presents the most optimal cost and overhead compared to the remaining solutions. This study opens up a new horizon for more secure 3G systems based on the randomization defense mechanisms.",IEEE Xplore,2016 4th IEEE International Colloquium on Information Science and Technology (CiSt),156

We focus on the high-level design of sequential circuits by targeting Finite State Machines (FSMs) and their vulnerability to non-invasive, side channel based, attacks. The unconventional paradigm shift needed is justified by showing that conventional, minimalism-based, FSM synthesis and encodings allow direct correlation between state/transitions and Hamming Models. A two-fold method, involving structural modifications and specific encoding strategies, is proposed for side-channel secure FSM (S*FSMs).

While many intrusion detection systems (IDSes) have been adapted to monitor ICS, they cannot detect malicious network packets from a compromised PLC that con-form to the network protocol. A domain expert needs to manually construct IDS rules to model a PLC’s behavior. That approach is time-consuming and error-prone. Alternatively, machine learning can infer a PLC’s behavior model from network traces, but that model may be inaccurate due to a lack of high-quality training data. This paper presents CoToRu - a toolchain that takes in the PLC’s code to automatically generate a comprehensive set of IDS rules. CoToRu comprises (1) an analyzer that parses PLC code to build a state transition table for modeling the PLC’s behavior, and (2) a generator that instantiates IDS rules for detecting deviations in PLC behavior. The generated rules can be imported into Zeek IDS to detect various attacks. We apply CoToRu to a power grid testbed and show that our generated rules provide superior performance compared to existing IDSes, including those based on statistical analysis, invariant-checking, and machine learning. Our prototype with CoToRu’s generated rules provide sub-millisecond detection latency, even for complex PLC logic.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE INFOCOM 2022 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications,158

With the growth in the number of Cloud Service Providers, many enterprises and organizations can use and associate services from multiple providers. There may be many Internet protocols for service access standards that are used to ensure interoperability between users browser and Web server, such as Representational State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Each service has its specific characteristics such as authentication and security requirements. Hence, Cloud providers attempt to lock customers into proprietary interfaces so consumers can find themselves at not expects inevitable vendor lock-in. Therefore, the focus of our paper is to propose a solution to this problem by using Cloud intermediate between Cloud providers and consumer in heterogeneous Cloud environments interfaces. This is to achieve benefits such as standardization and interoperability, minimizing lock-in of Cloud providers. To reach such benefits, we propose a Cloud SaaS based on two interfaces and an internet component. These interfaces are used in Cloud Consumer and Provider sides and therefore guarantee communication between Cloud Consumer and Provider using different Internet protocols for Web service access such as REST and SOAP.

But operating conditions within this domain strongly favour malicious actors over legitimate operators seeking to provide security and protect systems and information. Technical capabilities to establish dominance and cause damage in this domain are widely distributed, but legal and ethical constraints prevent legitimate actors from using them to their full potential. Within this context, net neutrality presents a limiting factor on the capability of legitimate actors to respond to harmful activity in cyberspace whose common aim is to install and uphold a technical imbalance. Under the principle of net neutrality, each data packet must be transmitted with equal priority, irrespective of its source, destination, content or purpose. This is disadvantageous to cyber defence. Comparisons to jungle or arctic warfare, where operating conditions are neutral and degrade the performance of each combatant side equally, are invalid, as malicious operators are capable of technically manipulating data traffic to their favour. While both malicious and legitimate actors may have comparable capabilities, legitimate actors are bound to legal and political restrictions, making them immobile in several cyber warfare scenarios. Transferring the principles of net neutrality to real life scenarios corresponds to depriving military, police and emergency operators from any privilege that allows them to respond to an incident - in effect, depriving them of their blue lights and emergency powers even in severe incidents targeting critical infrastructure that may threaten civilian lives. This paper investigates the potential opportunities and challenges of an adjustment to the principle of net neutrality to facilitate defensive action by legitimate actors; how this adjustment could contribute to regaining control in congested cyber domains in the case of national or international cyber incidents; and the risks associated. The different ways of dealing with net neutrality in cyber defence situations in the EU, UK and Russia are compared.

Privacy is a huge concern for IoT devices as personal information is constantly being shared through them. Though the best industrial standards like end-to-end encryption are being followed to ensure content-based privacy, contextual privacy concerns still exist. This study focuses on user activity inference attacks, where a passive network observer can infer the private in-home activity of a user by analyzing encrypted IoT traffic metadata. Most of the previous solutions addressing these attacks have either reduced the usability of the devices, increased data overhead, or failed against packet-level signature-based attack scenarios. This study introduces a new defense mechanism that combines dummy packet generation with dynamic link padding. This process makes it difficult for the adversary to avail contextual information about the state of the device (ON or OFF), along with the temporal information (time of state change) from encrypted IoT traffic metadata. We reverse the packet-level signature-based attacks to get device-specific signatures, which helps us generate dummy traffic for the duration of device-specific signatures. Consequently, this results in increased false positives for device state identifications and low traffic overhead. We simulate a state-of-the-art attack scenario to test and vindicate our solution over existing data sets.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,161

However, the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant strategies for CGRAs apply either temporal or spatial scheme, including redundancy, periodic detection, workload balancing, and reconfiguration, failing to exploit the feature of dynamic and partial reconfiguration of CGRAs. Also, vulnerable judging circuits and inflexible mode shifting bottleneck the reliability design of fault-tolerant CGRAs. This article proposes a novel multimode fault-tolerant framework for CGRAs, which combines spatial-redundant data paths with temporal-redundant voters and thus reduces the vulnerable judging circuits while balancing the performance and reliability. This framework can also enable a changing reliability level at runtime via an online configuration transformation method based on precompiled patterns. Within the proposed framework, we systematically searched the design space spanning various combinations of the mainstream schemes with a Markov process model to compare the effectiveness and accordingly selected five points as available modes in our design after comprehensive consideration of fault tolerance and time overhead on CGRA. The framework is comprehensively evaluated on a cycle-accurate CGRA simulator, considering both permanent and transient faults. The experimental results show that the fault coverage rate of single transient faults or permanent faults has increased from 71.74% to 93.84%, which means the fault tolerance of the system has been increased by 31.03% compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

The use of trusted platform modules (TPMs) offers new methods for improving the security of these well established technologies. How secure channel technologies can be adapted to use trusted computing concepts is subject to current research. A major part of this research addresses the integration of the TCG's specified remote attestation. Remote attestation enables a platform to provide a trustworthy proof of its current configuration (i.e. software that has been loaded on the platform). Hence, based on this proof, a remote platform can decide whether to open a channel to another platform or not. In current approaches, the proof of the platform configuration is processed before a secure channel is established, which is not opened if the reported configuration is not accepted by the hosts. However, one important problem has not been solved yet. Currently, no satisfying solution how the change of a platform's configuration can be securely and reliably reported to the remote platform whilst a channel is open, exists. A reliable method to provide a proof for a configuration change can be implemented with only minor modifications of the TPM specification and the TLS protocol.

It is now normal for performance and availability of such systems to be carefully measured and evaluated. Contracts that include financial penalties in case of breach are now common. However security is lagging behind this trend; it is as important to stakeholders as performance and availability, but is generally not included in the scope of service-level agreements between stakeholders, and handled instead on a best-effort basis, without any transparency nor SLA with their clients. One reason for this is the difficulty of objectively measuring security. Indeed, the actual security level of a system is dependent on a wide range of factors, some intrinsic to the system - such as a design or implementation mistake resulting in a vulnerability - and some extrinsic to it. For instance, an external event such as the publication of a vulnerability in an open-source software dependency or a change of political context in a country can widely impact the risks faced by an information system even if no actual change were made to the system. These factors are even more numerous in multi-tenant cloud infrastructures because of the sheer number of actors involved - and their sometimes conflicting incentives - and opportunities for both attack and defense at scale.

In real time environment, data-base may be created by keeping the record of operating states by state estimation. The severity of contingency for each case with respect to different contingencies (single line outages) is assessed by number of secure and insecure operating states, which is predicted by CBR. Security classes are defined by threshold value of maximum loadability margins, calculated using the continuation power flow analysis.

Decomposition of problems and systems into smaller, more manageable units has been at the heart of software engineering practice for decades. ""Separation of concerns"" gives software engineers the conceptual and practical tools to focus their attention, and their tools, on the parts of the problem or solution to which they are best suited. Perhaps one of the earliest boundaries used to separate concerns is that which exists between hardware and software - once that boundary is drawn, software engineers were able to focus their attention on the development of software within the hardware boundaries chosen. There has however, been a steady erosion of such boundaries: digital and physical connectivity have become the norm, and increasingly such connectivity can be ad hoc, spontaneous, and often unplanned (perhaps best exemplified by the Internet of Things paradigm). Moreover, the fluid and disappearing boundaries between technology and people have radically affected social behaviours (again, perhaps well exemplified by the proliferation of mobile and ubiquitous computing such as wearable and 'smart' technologies used in variety of personal and community settings). Such convergence between digital, physical, and social spaces has provided exciting opportunities for software engineers to, literally, 'cross boundaries', and, as a result, to have an impact on the physical and social worlds in which the software they build will operate. But in this brave new world with porous boundaries, security engineering and privacy management challenges abound. Effective security depends on the ability to control access to assets protected by boundaries. Effective privacy management depends on informed, consensual sharing of information across boundaries. Our thesis is that, although increasingly invisible, and rightly so, explicit awareness and sometimes representation of boundaries in cyber-physical-social systems facilitate good old fashioned separation of concerns, which in turn enables more effective software engineering of secure, privacy-aware software.

The system security constraints are in fact boundaries that surround all possible operating modes (scenarios) of the power system. In other words, these boundaries form the feasible operating domain - in the parameter space spanned by various operating variables - within which the system can safely be operated. For a given operating scenario, the associated security level is measured by the “distance” (for example, the Euclidean norm) of the operating point from the security region boundary. This paper reports on the results of a recently completed research and development paper, which included the development of innovative computerized schemes, which are capable of identifying dynamic operating security modes during the on-line operation of electric power systems. The methodology adopted in this paper includes the development of advanced, highly efficient computerized algorithms for fast identification of dynamic operating security modes of power systems.

Another challenge arises when assets vary dynamically at runtime. To accommodate these variabilities, it is necessary to monitor changes in assets, and apply the most appropriate countermeasures at runtime. The paper provides three main contributions for engineering adaptive security. First, it proposes a modeling notation to represent primary and secondary assets, along with their variability. Second, it describes how to use the extended models in engineering security requirements and designing required monitoring functions.

A typical ICS includes an extensive range of comput-erized devices, control systems, and networking appliances used to manage efficiently an industrial process across large geographical areas. ICS underpin sensitive and critical national infrastructures such as water treatment and energy production and transportation. The consequences of a successful attack against them can lead to shutting the infrastructure down which has major impacts such as production stoppages or safety implications for people, the environment, and assets. At the same time, running a process while the infrastructure is under attack or compromised also has safety im-plications, potentially catastrophic. This work-in-progress focuses on an adaptive approach, able to alter the defensive posture while providing assurances about operational capacity (or downgrading it) and safety. Our approach involves transforming policies from simply a means to enforce security requirements defined a priori, to adaptive objects that are capable to evolve in response to unfolding attacks. We use a case study of reconnaissance attacks and moving target defense as a means to realize such adaptive security policies.",IEEE Xplore,2022 ACM/IEEE 13th International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS),205

Chen,10.1109/DRPT.2011.5993863,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5993863,20110.0,IEEE Conferences,The contingency analysis (CA) has been an important tool in power system planning and security analysis for decades. CA studies the impact of equipment outage on the system. This paper presents the dynamic contingency redefinition in power system security analysis. Contingency definition is usually accomplished in an off-line development environment. The pre-defined contingency cases are studied in the off-line or on-line contingency analysis program. Usually the contingency definition defines hypothetical equipment outage or fault. It does not explicitly specify the isolating breakers of the fault. The dynamic contingency re-definition takes into account the actual response of protection subsystem to the equipment outage. It identifies the breakers required for isolating the contingency equipment. This provides additional accuracy of post contingency results to ensure the analysis accuracy and the remedial action schemes emulated correctly. Each re-defined contingency is simulated in CA by opening these breakers to evaluate their impact on the system. The ability to respect the status of manually operated switches is important to ensure the simulation mimics protection schemes. Any non-contingency equipment forced out as a result of these breaker openings will be added to the contingency equipment list. All outage equipment and breakers will be listed on the contingency definition display for each contingency case. The contingency re-definition function has been integrated into power system security analysis.,IEEE Xplore,2011 4th International Conference on Electric Utility Deregulation and Restructuring and Power Technologies (DRPT),208

The close dependency of major transmission paths requires an approach that takes that interaction into account while establishing operational transfer capability, and evaluates grid reliability and security on a system-wide basis. Thus, the concept of wide-area security region, which considers all essential constraints, including thermal, voltage stability, transient stability, and small signal stability, is proposed. This approach expands the idea of traditional transmission system nomograms to a multidimensional case, involving multiple system limits and parameters such as transmission path constraints, zonal generation or load, etc., considered concurrently. In this paper, the security region boundary is represented using piecewise approximation with the help of linear inequalities (so called hyperplanes) in a multidimensional space, consisting of system parameters that are critical for security analysis. The goal of this approximation is to find a minimum set of hyperplanes that describe the boundary with a given accuracy. Offline computer simulations are conducted to build the security region and the hyperplanes can be applied in real time with phasor information for on-line security assessment. Numerical simulations have been performed for the full size Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system model, which comprises 15 126 buses and 3034 generators.

Identifying and evaluating assets are therefore key activities in any security engineering process - from modeling threats and attacks, discovering existing vulnerabilities, to selecting appropriate countermeasures. However, despite their crucial role, assets are often neglected during the development of secure software systems. Indeed, many systems are designed with fixed security boundaries and assumptions, without the possibility to adapt when assets change unexpectedly, new threats arise, or undiscovered vulnerabilities are revealed. To handle such changes, systems must be capable of dynamically enabling different security countermeasures. This paper promotes assets as first-class entities in engineering secure software systems. An asset model is related to requirements, expressed through a goal model, and the objectives of an attacker, expressed through a threat model. These models are then used as input to build a causal network to analyze system security in different situations, and to enable, when necessary, a set of countermeasures to mitigate security threats. The causal network is conceived as a runtime entity that tracks relevant changes that may arise at runtime, and enables a new set of countermeasures.

Traditional protection systems are non-adaptive and have been usually applied with bias towards dependability, one of the two considerations on designing electric grid protection systems (the other one is security). The art and science of protection and control of tomorrow drives the power system professionals to design and implement schemes that are adaptive and aim towards security. It is important to minimize system exposures when the power system is in a stressed state or in early stages of a sequence of events to halt or mitigate disturbance propagation. One of the leading contributions to the future of grid protection would be to avoid incorrect tripping of unaffected equipment therefore maintaining the power system integrity. In addition, with the ever-increasing load demand and the advent of the deregulated power market recently, power systems are pushed more often to operate close to design limits and with more uncertainty of the system operating mode.

Therefore, different kinds of software may not be exposed to the same zero-day security loophole, preventing the attacker from taking charge of multiple substations at the same time. In this paper, the optimal scheme of software deployment considering long-term risk mitigation is studied. Firstly, the framework of diversity-based cyber defense against malicious attacks is formulated. Secondly, the risk index based on representative attack patterns is constructed, which is the objective to be minimized. Thirdly, considering that the deployment scheme is long-term stable while the operating mode varies with time, we construct a multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming to mitigate the average risk of operating modes.

The proposed system's first reaction after detecting malicious packets is to generate an alert and log them; if the number of packets goes beyond threshold limit in one second, the second counteraction takes place to block the attackers IP address through firewall.

ASPAD is carried out in three phases: dynamic data partitioning, response time estimation, and adaptive security quality control. Hence, ASPAD is conducive to adaptively and expeditiously determining security schemes for disk requests in a way to improve security of networked parallel disk systems while making an effort to guarantee desired response times of the requests.

In this paper, we analyze the security guarantees that used to defend against physical attacks, and make the observation that heterogeneous GPU memory system may not always need all the security mechanisms to achieve the security guarantees. Based on the memory types as well as memory access patterns either explicitly specified in the GPU programming model or implicitly detected at run time, we propose adaptive security memory support for heterogeneous memory on GPUs. Specifically, we first identify the read-only data and propose to only use MAC (Message Authentication Code) to protect their integrity. By eliminating the freshness checks on read-only data, we can use an on-chip shared counter for such data regions and remove the corresponding parts in the Bonsai Merkel Tree (BMT), thereby reducing the traffic due to encryption counters and the BMT. Second, we detect the common streaming data access pattern and propose coarse- grain MACs for such stream data to reduce the MAC access bandwidth. With the hardware-based detection of memory type (read-only or not) and memory access patterns (streaming or not), our proposed approach adapts the security support to significantly reduce the performance overhead without sacrificing the security guarantees. Our evaluation shows that our scheme can achieve secure memory on GPUs with low overheads for memory-intensive workloads. Among the fifteen memory-intensive workloads in our evaluation, our design reduces the performance overheads of secure GPU memory from 53.9% to 8.09% on average. Compared to the state-of- the-art secure memory designs for GPU [17], [33], our scheme outperforms PSSM by up to 41.63% and 9.5% on average and outperforms Common counters by 84.04% on average for memory-intensive workloads.

Nguyen; X. Zong,10.1109/TASE.2022.3173368,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773283,20230.0,IEEE Journals,"The online small-signal stability assessment of electrical power grids is typically a challenging problem due to uncertainties and parameter variations of power system dynamics as well as the incurred high computational complexity. This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for dynamic small-signal stability assessment of power grids by estimating the region of attraction (ROA) for operating states in real time. By analyzing the latest sampling data of power grids in a fixed time window, an up-to-date training set is constructed with the aid of converse Lyapunov function, which enables us to develop an online learning approach based on Gaussian Process (GP) to assess the stability level of power grids. As a result, an iteration algorithm is designed to update the assessment parameters by learning the input-output pairs in the training set. Theoretical analysis is conducted to ensure the existence of converse Lyapunov function for differential-algebraic system that serves to describe power system dynamics, as well as to estimate the region of attraction for operating states with a given confidence level. In particular, a practical method is proposed to leverage time series of phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements including voltage/current magnitude, phase and frequency (i.e., PMU data) of real power grids for validating the online GP approach. Moreover, validations are taken to substantiate the proposed approach by using PMU data of real smart-grid infrastructure and IEEE test cases. The proposed assessment approach contributes to situational awareness of human operators in the control station, thereby taking proactive remedial actions prior to emergencies. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the problem of online assessment of power systems security but it also applies to other industrial control systems that have stable state trajectories. Existing approaches to security assessment of power systems generally focus on the adoption of various machine-learning algorithms by treating power grid as a “black box,” which ignores the intrinsic characteristics of power systems and thus restricts the inference performance. This paper proposes a new approach using limited sampling data and system dynamics to construct a domain of stability for power grids, which can reflect the evolution of security zones and provide more accurate predictions. In this work, we mathematically characterize the domain of stability for a practical power grid by analyzing and learning its state trajectories. Then we show how the proposed approach can be efficiently implemented online, which can timely alert human operators to abnormalities. Preliminary validations suggest that this approach is feasible and effective. In future research, we will incorporate it into an energy management system and test it in other industrial processes.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,253

Security- and safety-critical applications require access control policies that define how these resources interact to ensure that malicious and unsafe behaviors do not occur. Aker is a design and verification framework for on-chip access control. The core of Aker is the access control wrapper (ACW)–a high-performance yet efficient hardware module that dynamically arbitrates on-chip communications. Aker distributes ACWs across the SoC and programs them to perform local access control. Aker provides a firmware generation tool and a property-driven security verification methodology to ensure that the ACWs are properly integrated and configured. Aker security verification confirms that the ACW behaves properly at IP level. It verifies the hardware root of trust firmware configures the ACW correctly. And it evaluates system-level security threats due to interactions between shared resources. Aker is experimentally validated on a Xilinx UltraScale+ programmable SoC.

We have argued that incorporating an explicit representation of the environment's topology enables reasoning on the location of assets being protected and the proximity of potentially harmful agents. This paper proposes to engineer topology aware adaptive security systems by identifying violations of security requirements that may be caused by topological changes, and selecting a set of security controls that prevent such violations. Our approach focuses on physical topologies; it maintains at runtime a live representation of the topology which is updated when assets or agents move, or when the structure of the physical space is altered. When the topology changes, we look ahead at a subset of the future system states. These states are reachable when the agents move within the physical space. If security requirements can be violated in future system states, a configuration of security controls is proactively applied to prevent the system from reaching those states. Thus, the system continuously adapts to topological stimuli, while maintaining requirements satisfaction. Security requirements are formally expressed using a propositional temporal logic, encoding spatial properties in Computation Tree Logic (CTL). The Ambient Calculus is used to represent the topology of the operational environment - including location of assets and agents - as well as to identify future system states that are reachable from the current one.

In the previous physically-isolated world, robust static security for selected matched problems was often sufficient. Today, we need a new approach to providing security, because even adaptive security is insufficient. This new approach is termed here a cognitive security system.

First, the talk starts from a review of the existing security systems, with their problems and required solutions, as well as their vulnerabilities, attacks, and defences.

Although in recent years significant progress has been achieved in biometric identification technology, the progress of single technologies does not dramatically improve the overall performance or solve the system-level problems of social security. Currently in addition to improvements of single technology, the following system-level technical bottlenecks must be solved to improve the overall performance of social security: 1. Blind spots of perception exist in surveillance area of due to the non-overlap of surveillance sensors, 2. The performance of single identification technology decreases sharply in complex surveillance scenarios such as poor lighting conditions or disguise, 3. Traditional warning technologies become invalid due to the multi-stage non-stationary evolution feature of complex events. Three challenges listed above closely relate to three scientific problems in the analysis technology of big visual data on three levels: sensing data, identification technology and pattern recognition. Our study aims at (1) exploiting the complete mapping mechanism between physical space and multivariate sensing spaces to fill-in the blind spots of sensing data, (2) exploring the correlative mechanism of multi-modal objects in multivariate sensing spaces to improve the analytical performance from single identification technology, (3) studying the spatial-temporal evolution mechanism in the entire lifecycle of complex events to extend pattern recognition from local space and time. The security space is the physical space with comprehensive protective ability, which includes ubiquitous sensing, reliable identification, penetrating trend analysis and approaching danger warning at any time, at any location, for any object and for any behavior. Aiming to build the theory of security space, this study is divided into three levels: information acquisition and perceptional computation, scene analysis and evolution prediction, resource scheduling and system applications. Then it is further divided into five tasks: (1) task 1: visual object recognition and big data based identification, (2) task 2: situational awareness of groups and multi-scale revolution, (3) task 3: semantic analysis of scenes and correlative computation in multivariate spaces, (4) task 4: big scale visual retrieval and security risk analysis, (5) task 5: Warning system of the security space and its applications. Task 1 corresponds to the first level because sensing and identification of objects is the basis for analysis. Task 2 and 3 correspond to the second level since group behavior, events, scene and their evolution are crucial for the prediction and warning of security events. Task 4 and 5 correspond to the third level of this study in order to develop the high performance computing platform, to conduct system evaluation and application demonstration. Big visual data contains massive high-dimensional sensing data, implying the complicated relationship among social objects. In fact, in the world of data, the spatial-temporal relationship between the big data objects is more essential than the causal relationship, and these private and implicit relationships compose the core values of the big data social analysis. Only the analysis of individuals, groups and scenes in big visual data are based on the core element of social security analysis, that is"" social structure and social activities"", can it supports the strategic transference of urban security system from investigation afterwards to warning in advance. The overall purpose of this study is to build the big data analysis system in security space, realizing the intelligent big visual data system which supports data analysis of hundred billions of feature data, billions of image data, millions of visual sensing terminals. The expected achievements on the warning and protection system for large spaces can reach the international leading level. Based on the achievements above, the project plans to develop 10 intelligent big data analysis products of 3 categories, and the expected benefits of industrialization promotion can reach 100 billion, which promotes the upstream and downstream industry to realize economic benefits 3 billion.

Data centers hosting sensitive data and mission-critical systems, especially centers that belong to governmental agencies, have been under tremendous pressure to secure their databases in compliance with several security guidelines. Such requirements mandate that each system passes a strict security scan before it is deemed suitable to go into operational mode and that it be subjected to regular audits thereafter. This in turn has been putting tremendous pressure on database administrators who, in many cases, are already overwhelmed by the tasks of installing, properly maintaining, and configuring their systems in a way that provides optimal performance. However, it is becoming extremely challenging, time consuming, and resource intensive to address security demands under tight budgets and timelines. Therefore, it would be advantageous to implement autonomic features into database systems to address some aspects of this challenge. This paper presents a framework that embeds autonomic capabilities into database systems to provide self- protection features in case of unauthorized, inadvertent, or intentional change in security parameters. This is achieved by embedding into the database the capability to compare each security configuration parameter change attempt (or request) with an embedded predefined security policy before allowing or rejecting the change.

The proposed optimization approach strives to adapt the security measures to the trust level on the nodes on the path and factors in the security-related overhead in the link cost. In addition, a novel path rotation scheme is proposed to enable the use of resource-efficient security measures without risking an increase in vulnerability. The applicability of the proposed optimization is validated using the ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector (AOMDV) routing protocol and its performance advantage is confirmed via ns2 simulation experiments.",IEEE Xplore,2009 IEEE 34th Conference on Local Computer Networks,273

These architectural configuration changes have affect on the overall system quality attributes (i.e. performance, security and reliability). Therefore, modelling SoS architecture is a challenging task as CSs and the possible architectural configurations are not entirely known at design time.

The proposed system combines real-time scheduling with security service enhancement. The scheduling unit uses the differentiated-earliest-deadline-first (Diff-EDF) scheduler and the security enhancement scheme adopts a congestion control mechanism. The required QoS is guaranteed for different types (audio and video) of real-time data flows, while the packet security levels are adaptively enhanced according to the feedbacks from the congestion control module. Compared with the IPsec protocol, the proposed scheme reduces the number of pending packets at the destinations.

Remote access to IEDs or user interfaces in a substation for maintenance purposes is a common practice. However, there are potential cyber-physical system vulnerabilities in a substation, e.g., unsecured standard protocols, remote controllable IEDs, and unauthorized remote access to substation IEDs. In addition, some substation IEDs and user interfaces have a web server and hence it may provide a remote configuration change and control with default passwords. Even if firewalls and cryptography schemes are used for cyber security, weak security key management cryptography and mis-configured firewalls are still exposed to intruders. From IT point of view, cyber security issues are well known and new security technologies are available. However, security research on the integration of IT and physical power systems for critical infrastructures is still an emerging area. Intruders behaviors will generate logs across all substation-level networks, e.g., IEDs, firewalls and user interfaces. For instance, the steps of Stuxnet attack are based on: (1) intrusion attempts, (2) change of the file system, (3) change of target systems setting, and (4) change of target systems status. Therefore, anomaly detection is performed based on logs of intruders foot prints. Temporal anomaly can be determined from discrepancies between event logs from two different time periods. In the proposed anomaly index, a value of 0 implies no difference, whereas 1 indicates the maximal discrepancy [1]. In order to identify the impact of substation cyber intrusion to the power grid, cyber intrusion scenarios have been conducted on the substation IT network using a SCADA testbed at University College Dublin (UCD). The first intrusion scenario involves compromised substation gateway. A false signal is generated and an open circuit breaker (CB) command is sent to substation CBs. The second scenario is to generate forged CB status at the gateway. As a result of this attack, control center operators will observe fake data about the CB status. However, the actual substation CBs status has not changed. The third scenario is to generate fabricated analogue values to a control center using a man-in-the-middle attack. Once an intruder successfully compromises the substation LAN, (s)he is able to monitor and capture all measured data which comes from power grids. If attackers send fabricated data to the control center and the data travel through the state estimation filter, control center operators will observe an operational emergency. As a result, the operators may take emergency control actions such as reducing the generation voltage or reactive power while the power system is actually in a normal condition. There is a possibility these (logical) actions based on fabricated data will drive the system into a sequence of cascading events, leading to a power outage. Mitigation actions are conducted on substation IT and power grid. For IT mitigation, intrusion detection system (IDS) which uses anomaly detection algorithm based on temporal event construction has been used in a substation network. An Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm with an objective function that minimizes load shedding in the grid is used for power system mitigation. The proposed collaboration scheme between IDS and the firewall is able to disconnect intruders in the substation network. Emergency control actions are taken to mitigate the effects of cyber intrusions as an attempt to restore a system back to a normal condition.",IEEE Xplore,2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,283

The proposed model considers the level of situation awareness and the state of the information infrastructure.

Then the critical contingencies and operating states, and which external threats and causes that may result in such severe consequences, are identified. This is opposed to the traditional risk and vulnerability analysis which starts by analyzing threats and what can happen as a chain of events.

With the development of the Internet, it is essential to effectively extract the relation between financial entities from internet financial intelligence and build a financial security knowledge graph, which lays the foundation for monitoring of internet security of finance. For relation extraction of Chinese internet financial intelligence, the existing models are all based on single-modal text semantics ignoring the role of Chinese pictographic semantics, while the shape and structure of Chinese characters contains useful semantics. In addition, the pictographic semantic fusion method of Chinese text also needs to be improved for better performance. To solve these shortcomings, we propose a Chinese Multimodal Relation Extraction model (CMRE), which improves the relation extraction ability on the Chinese internet financial intelligence. In CMRE, we extract pictographic semantics based on Chinese character shape and structure. Furthermore, we design a novel multi-modal semantic fusion module based on improved Transformer to effectively fuse the text and pictographic semantics.

This growth has made the present day systems very big and complex. The complexity is arising especially due to many Interconnections, different types of loads and larger generating units. Also there is uncertainty in load forecasting. With EHV interconnections the disturbances are felt even in geographically distant parts of the system, increasing the severity of the disturbances. These factors make the satisfactory operating of the system a more difficult task. Added to this, Society is becoming more dependent on electric power; and it is essential to make the power available to customers without any interruption and within certain limits of voltage and frequency variations. This means that there is a great need to ensure that a system is as economical, reliable and secure as possible [1]. High reliability of the system is usually obtained by following the principles of bulk power supply planning. However, due to delay in commissioning of new plants and equipment, equipment outages, unexpected load demands and disturbances, the system may be forced to operate in or close to critical and emergency conditions. Hence, in addition to sophisticated planning and designing of the system, an effective operation and control of power systems is essential. The maintenance of a system in a reliable and secure mode is becoming an Important part of the Job of the operators. In the past, more emphasis was given to economic operation; but in view of the consequences of power failures, reliable and secure operation of the system is being given more importance. Security assessment deals with the tracking of the system and deciding whether the present state is secure or not. If the system's state is found to be insecure, it forewarns the operator to take possible remedial action or to be ready for the disturbance if it takes place. This is done before any disturbance (which may lead to failure or deterioration in the quality of supply) occurS. Thus security evaluation is essentially an on-line procedure. The paper will discuss the different operating states of a power system, system security and different approaches for transient security assessment.

Recently, legal regulations have also become effective that require automobile manufacturers to set up a monitoring system for fleet-wide security analysis. The growing amount of software, networking, and the automation of driving create new challenges for security. Context-awareness, situational understanding, adaptive security, and threat intelligence are necessary to cope with these ever-increasing risks. In-vehicle security should be adaptive to secure the car in an infinite number of (driving) situations.

Secure remote management allows more outsourcing to third parties but leads to continuously changing factory networks. Mobile or even autonomous devices again add complexity. However, current factory owners are conservative for good reasons: changing a well-designed system is costly and may cause failures and outages of the production lines. The virtual tenant network (VTN) concept addresses this conflict by means of combining network virtualization, hardware virtualization, cloud technologies and IT automation. Thus, tenants are isolated and configuration changes or security breaches in one tenant will not affect others.

A probabilistic approach is chosen, and an appropriate power system model is developed for analyzing the dynamic behavior of the different operational modes of the system. The model includes the transients induced by primary and secondary disturbance events. They are modeled by switches in the model whose states depend on the instantaneous values of certain system variables. The model characterizes the interaction between the dynamic state of the system and the network topology as defined by the status of the various protective relays in the system. A dynamic security region is defined as a subset of the state-structure space of the power system such that at any moment in time an operating point within the region satisfies all the constraints required for secure power system operation. The probabilistic evolution of the state and structure is computed as the solution of a system of linear partial differential equations with matching conditions at the switching boundaries. A dynamic security measure is defined as the integral of the joint probability density of the state and structure of the system over the dynamic security region for all possible structural variations. This computation yields the probability that the power system remains secure for the range of primary events considered.

As a basis for cost-effective security support in real-time embedded systems, we define a quantitative notion of Strength of Defense (SoD). Based on the SoD concept, we propose a novel adaptive security policy in which the SoD can be degraded by decreasing the cryptographic key length for certain tasks, if necessary, to improve the success ratio under overload conditions. Our approach is lightweight. The time complexity of our approach is linear and its amortized version has the constant overhead per SoD adaptation period. Moreover, our approach supports desirable security features requiring an attacker to do extra work to find the cryptographic key.

Specifically, in the proposed architecture, all generators in the MG operate as either voltage regulators (active agents), or current sources (passive agents), with their operating mode being determined by software-defined MG control supported by the control plane communication performed over the power bus. For the purpose of control plane communication, we adopt power talk, a modem-less, low-rate, and power-line communication solution designed for direct current MGs.

Threat detection operates at layers 3 and 4 to determine a baseline for network traffic, analysing packet drop statistics and generating threat reports based on traffic patterns. Despite producing a large volume of statistical information relating to several security events, further effort is required to mine and visually report more significant information and conclude the security status of the network.

Our schemes allow the intermediary to selectively remove portions of the stream and, thus, permit common media transcoding techniques such as scalable compression and multiple file switching.

This leads to open and outsourcing all or part of their information system (IS) to create collaborative processes by composing business services picked in each partner IS and to take advantage of Cloud computing. Business services outsourcing and their dynamic collaboration context can bring lost of control on IS and new security risks can occur. This leads to inconsistent protection allowing competitors to access to unauthorized information. To address this issue, systematic security service invocations may be added, without paying attention to the business context leading to costly over protection. To address this issue, an adaptive security service model deployment is required to provide a business service consistent protection by taking into account the collaboration context (business service data criticity, partners involved in the collaboration, etc.), and the cloud deployment and execution environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security model based on MDS@run.time, the marriage of Model Driven Security (MDS) and Models@run.time approaches, allowing to select at runtime the appropriate security components to apply. The MDS approach is used to generate security policies, which are interpreted at runtime and load appropriate security mechanisms depending on the context (which takes advantage of the Models@run.time approach) ensuring business process end to end protection. A proof of concept prototype is built on top of the OW2 FraSCAti middleware, validating our proposition efficiency.

Security agents, such as cops, use public camera footage to track down the accused's movements. People are assigned to this responsibility of watching the public camera recordings. These individuals must constantly watch the detected faces and compare them to the accused faces. However, because this is a continual process, there is a high risk of manual errors when utilizing this method. The accused person's face can also be discovered using this method, but by the time the assigned person tells the nearest police station, the accused person may have left/escaped. With all of these considerations in mind, it is necessary to avoid these blunders. Manual mistake in determining the perpetrator's face and relaying the information to officials swiftly are the main problems. Installing a camera with an already supplied data collection of suspected people can help cross-check the detected faces with the uploaded data set, which is the first issue. This improves the precision of the accused's detection. The second issue is telling officials about the suspected criminal or accused in a timely manner. If the installed camera has a transmitting unit, with the receiver on the official side and the transmitter on the camera end, this will work. The information is swiftly transmitted to the authorities, and there is a good possibility that the perpetrator will be apprehended.

This has been demonstrated by a growing number of new encryption algorithms, more intelligent firewall and intrusion detection techniques, new developments in multifactor authentication, advances in malware protection and many more. During a similar period of time the industry has seen the need for network infrastructure which provides a greater degree of trust which has resulted in the development of forensic analysis tools which meet the requirements of law enforcement agencies. Such tools must provide for commercial intelligence and national security. This paper proposes that application of the common ground between security and forensics has great potential to provide for improvements in the effort to achieve real-time adaptive security. This implies an architecture which can detect security breaches and in real-time record and analyse traffic logs in a forensically sound manner, provide corrective feedback to security devices and attempt to trace back to the source of the attack. In addressing computer security and forensic analysis from a real-time perspective, this paper recognises that some of these processes already exist, but proposes methods whereby the ongoing damage and potential risk to critical infrastructure can be reduced. This requires the implementation of a highly integrated approach to security and forensics such that they can inter-work in real-time in order to address the significant security issues which currently face the industry.",IEEE Xplore,2010 Fourth International Conference on Network and System Security,342

A biometric system works by collecting important biological or behavioural traits of the prospective user. Extracted traits are stored as a feature template in the database of the biometric system. The reliability and accuracy of the biometric systems are improved by using multiple modalities, sensors or algorithms during recognition process. These systems are called as Multibiomtric systems which results into greater accuracy but with increased cost and complexity. In comparison to unibiometric system, a multi-modal system provides better recognition performance and protection from spoof attacks. Biometric systems are generally used in modern day computing to provide security during authentication in many applications but these systems themselves are vulnerable to various types of attacks. In this paper, an analysis of various security issues and template security schemes for Biometric Systems is presented. One of the challenges is to protect user's raw image data from imposters as well as to secure template data.

Storing data and performing computations using for example cloud services is commonplace nowadays. However, the information security in network-based computation rarely is satisfactory. One technique to improve information security for networked computations is based on secure multiparty computations. The idea of multiparty computation originates from Yao, who considered the secure computation with two parties by introducing the technique called garbled circuits. The technique was then generalized, but still the exact definitions for different security measures were not established until Bellare, Hoang and Rogaway proposed a definition of a garbling scheme and several security notions for garbling schemes. This gave inspiration to study the security properties of garbling schemes from different perspectives, including adaptivity and reusability. In this paper, we study the adaptive security for a certain type of reusable garbling schemes. First, we consider general constraints to achieve security for this specific type of garbling schemes.

This paper aims at establishing an step-by-step algorithm to study impacts of error in measurements on system security indices. Two different security indices representing under voltage severity and over load severity are studied in this paper. The proposed algorithm has three major steps. In the first step, typical measurements are sampled according to the system operating state and randomly generated errors. This is done using Monte Carlo sampling approach. The second step is to extract an approximate model of the system true state which is done via state estimators.

We posit that this requires addressing two interdependent technical areas: (a) a Moving Target Defense (MTD) framework both at networking and software levels, and (b) an Adaptive Security-enabled Traffic Engineering (ASeTE) approach to select optimal countermeasures by considering the effectiveness of countermeasures and network bandwidth allocations while minimizing the intrusiveness to the applications and the cost of deploying the countermeasures.

This method thus provides operators with information on the near-future reliability of the power system and has the ability to warn them when preventive actions might be required. To achieve a sufficient accuracy, this assessment must take into account multi-state components such as generating units with derated states, multiple transmission lines with common-mode outages and the uncertainty on the load forecast. To achieve the speed required for online use, the method relies on the State Space Partitioning (SSP) technique, which divides the system state space into two subspaces. The system states with a large probability of occurrence comprise the first subspace and are identified using the Fast Sorting Technique (FST). System states that have a low probability of occurrence but which could have severe consequences are sampled using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) over the residual subspace. This computational acceleration is particularly important when multi-state components are taken into account. Tests carried out using the IEEE-RTS demonstrate the speed and accuracy of this enhanced SSP method.",IEEE Xplore,2010 IEEE 11th International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems,367

Both sensor and actuator are destroyed by attackers, which makes the feedback control design unable to access the traditional error surface. Firstly, a state observer is constructed to mitigate the impact of sensor attacks. And then neural networks are used to approximate the nonlinear term and compensate for state-dependent actuator attacks. Finally, in order to reduce the impact of FDI attacks, we design a special time-varying symmetry barrier function in backstepping control design, which can achieve specific output signal constraints under FDI attacks. Through the above control strategy, the output constraint control problem of CPSs under FDI attacks is solved.

However, it mainly pays off in software construction approaches that rely on planned architectures, in which sources of threats can be anticipated beforehand. These axiomatic assumptions are, however, increasingly untrue in contemporary software development practices in which software systems evolve drastically in later stages. In addition, software-intensive systems are increasingly faced with uncertainty in their operational contexts, and these are nearly impossible to enumerate in early development stages.

The energy processing capability of power systems depends heavily on the reliability of information systems. The reliability model of cyber space includes not only the binary-state operation-failure representation of physical devices, but also the multi-state representation of information flow in corresponding networks. This paper proposes a reliability modeling and assessment method for the power information system (i.e., cyber space in power system). The proposed composite Markov model would couple physical characteristics and information flow performances in a two-layer model. The proposed reliability methods combine the sequential Monte-Carlo simulation with the linear programming model to acquire maximum flows that would supply power demands. The proposed methodology is applied to the reliability analyses of the power information system in the IEEE 14-bus system in which the performances of the proposed indices are evaluated.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,387

Temporal diversity can be achieved by making periodic configuration changes; however in an infrastructure of multiple similarly purposed computers diversity must also be spatial, ensuring multiple computers do not simultaneously share the same configuration and potential vulnerabilities. Given the number of possible changes and their potential interdependencies discovering computer configurations that are secure, functional, and diverse is challenging. This paper describes how a Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be employed to find temporally and spatially diverse secure computer configurations. In the proposed approach a computer configuration is modeled as a chromosome, where an individual configuration setting is a trait or allele. The GA operates by combining multiple chromosomes (configurations) which are tested for feasibility and ranked based on performance which will be measured as resistance to attack. Successive iterations of the GA yield configurations that are often more secure and diverse due to the crossover and mutation processes. Simulations results will demonstrate this approach can provide at MT environment for a large infrastructure of similarly purposed computers by discovering temporally and spatially diverse secure configurations.",IEEE Xplore,2011 4th Symposium on Configuration Analytics and Automation (SAFECONFIG),388

On the other hand, it also makes the power system more vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. One attack that has serious consequences is the False Data Injection (FDI) attack against the state estimation process. Although some techniques have been proposed to select meters to protect, none of them considers the cost of protecting meters, and thus will not perform well when only a limited number of meters can be protected due to budget limitation. In this paper, we consider a new problem: Given a limited budget, how to select the most critical meters to protect so that the probability of attackers launching successful stealthy FDI attack is minimized? We first formalize this problem which is NP-complete, and then propose heuristic based solutions. The idea is to rank and select meters based on a metric called vulnerability index, which considers two factors: how likely the meter will be targeted by the attacker to launch FDI attacks and how much damage will be caused by compromising the meter in case of a successful stealthy FDI attack. Evaluation results show that our algorithm can significantly reduce the probability of successful attacks, as well as the potential damage caused by FDI attacks.",IEEE Xplore,2018 IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security (CNS),389

Moreover, transmit power control is employed to enhance the rate of packet reception of the legitimate receiver.

TreeKEM is the currently considered candidate by the IETF MLS working group, but dynamic group operations (i.e. adding and removing users) can cause efficiency issues. In this paper we formalize and analyze a variant of TreeKEM which we term Tainted TreeKEM (TTKEM for short).

This version is more efficient than TreeKEM for some natural distributions of group operations, we quantify this through simulations.Our second contribution is two security proofs for TTKEM which establish post compromise and forward secrecy even against adaptive attackers. The security loss (to the underlying PKE) in the Random Oracle Model is a polynomial factor, and a quasipolynomial one in the Standard Model. Our proofs can be adapted to TreeKEM as well. Before our work no security proof for any TreeKEM-like protocol establishing tight security against an adversary who can adaptively choose the sequence of operations was known.

Accordingly, a high throughput, low latency Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure should be opted in this regard. Due to the low cost, low power profile, dynamic nature, improved accuracy and scalability, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be a good choice. Yet, the efficiency of a WSN depends a lot on the network design and the routing technique. In this paper a new design of the ICT network for smart grid using WSN is proposed. In order to understand the interactions between different entities, detect their operational levels, design the routing scheme and identify false data injection by particular ICT entities, a new model of interdependency called the Multi State Implicative Interdependency Model (MSIIM) is proposed in this paper, which is an updated version of the Modified Implicative Interdependency Model (MIIM) [1].

For fast operation, the outlined approach uses an adaptive trip logic that shifts between the 2-of-of-2 operating mode and the differential principle alone depending on a detection of CT saturation.

Recently, In-band Network Telemetry (INT) has presented its unique capabilities in acquiring the insights of a network and thus has been adopted in many production networks. However, less attention was put on the potential threats on INT (e.g., the man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojan horse injection) that may falsify network measurements resulting in catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose a secure INT architecture called SINT that can effectively mitigate INT vulnerabilities and can be implemented using ‘chiplet’ based multi-modal network processors (MNP). SINT adopts blockchain technology into INT, in which a network status snapshot acquired via INT is viewed as a block and added into a network telemetry blockchain to prevent arbitrary access and malicious modification. To minimize the intrusiveness of the INT and blockchain operations, SINT is designed to be a lightweight protocol and uses improved RAFT consensus mechanisms to reduce its network and computing overhead. The design of the chiplet MNP system makes SINT highly flexible and adaptive to facilitate INT convergence and related blockchain updates. In the SINT architecture, INT tasks and blockchain operations are dispatched to different chips to achieve an optimal trade-off among measurement accuracy, security requirements, and computing resource on the data plane. Experiments and simulations show that SINT can alleviate most cyberattacks on INT and retain 97% of bandwidth utilization for other users’ normal traffic in a complex scenario with 500 nodes.

Such impact is measured by the change of the setpoint (change-driven CR) or the distance between the operating state and the critical state (criticality-driven CR).

However, the multi-modal probability distributions of both measurements and state variables in SE due to ever-changing operating points and structural/topological changes pose great challenges in detecting and localizing FDIA.

Third, to avoid model collapse caused by multi-modal measurement distribution, an AE-based generative adversarial network (GAN) is derived to generate a diverse candidate set of normal measurement vectors with various operational topologies.

OT networks have traditionally been isolated from IT networks, and therefore, security has been of minor concern. Given the trend toward interconnecting OT and IT networks for business reasons, and given the disclosure of highly sophisticated attacks against OT environments, OT network operators increasingly recognize the need to deploy security solutions that are widely known in IT also to OT. OT networks are running critical control processes. Configuration changes are avoided to reduce the risk of misconfiguration or unforeseeable side effects detrimental to the network's operation. Therefore, passive non-intrusive security technologies are favored. Consequently, security intelligence applied to passively collected network data is the most acceptable technology to be deployed in OT networks. In this paper, we show how IT-specific security intelligence techniques can be applied to passively collected OT network data. The techniques have been developed for protecting SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems and have been validated in an industrial cyber security testing laboratory.",IEEE Xplore,IBM Journal of Research and Development,431

Modern industrial processes leverage advanced IT technologies to increase productivity and often combine multiple system concepts such as Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and Cloud Computing. Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS) are key enablers of this revolution. In CPPS, raw materials, machines, and operations are interconnected to form a sophisticated network. Protecting them against advanced cyber-threats is a priority concern for the future implementation of Industry 4.0 applications. Any impairment of such systems can lead, in fact, to catastrophic damages resulting in a substantial financial loss for governments, companies, as well as endanger the safety of the society. The need for high availability and reliability of these systems is therefore the pillar guiding our research. This paper proposes the adoption of anomaly detection as a method to support self-adaptation in CPPS and to ensure flexibility, reliability, and protection of industrial environments against modern cyber threats. An anomaly detection mechanism can be employed to monitor, and learn the normal behavior of an industrial system, and to generate alerts when the observed events indicate abnormal activities. On this concept we base our work, and we demonstrate how timely identifying critical security events can enable, through the self-adaptation (e.g., triggering automatic configuration changes), an efficient protection of the CPPS against advanced threats, and an effective containment of their effects.",IEEE Xplore,2018 IEEE Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS),432

Notably, ICT systems may suffer from cyber attacks and communication latency, which could result in the malfunctions of DSRs and consequently bring adverse impacts on the reliability of power systems. In this paper, a novel operating reliability evaluation framework for multi-state power systems with DSRs and wind power considering malfunctions of cyber systems is proposed. For avoiding increasing complexity caused by multiple system states, an analytic method based on Lz transform technique is proposed to achieve dynamic system reliability. The reliability model for a typical hierarchical decentralized control infrastructure in demand side considering cyber attacks and communication latency is first proposed. Then, reserve capacity from DSRs considering stochastic behavior under the cyber infrastructure is modelled. Moreover, multi-state models for power generation systems with stochastic wind power and conventional generation are developed considering cyber malfunctions.

The key solution to achieve this goal is to integrate multiple avionic systems, apply new signal processing and RF capabilities. A generalized and reconfigurable architecture of Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) with integrated and modularised structure based on Direct RF Sampling (DRFS) and Software Defined Radio (SDR) is presented in this paper for avionic applications. The proposed architecture is composed of a DRFS digital receiver integrated within a SDR software modules. DRFS technology is adopted in the digital receiver, which consists of Pre-selection Filters and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to provide flexible compatibility for diverse modulation modes and various RF/IF frequency bands. By employing the concept of DRFS/SDR, distinct procedures for different avionic purposes, such as Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) and Instrument Landing System (ILS), can be achieved in the same hardware platform. Notably, this proposed architecture has the potential to be reconfigured and improved in several ways without any hardware change to accommodate new features and signal capabilities.

To cater security issues, variety of security frameworks for secure software development life cycle (SDLC) were introduced. Secure SDLC is created by integrating security-related activities to an each phase of in used development methodologies such as waterfall model or agile model. However, the application security problem continues to grow. Strict, complicated and heavyweight frameworks are underutilized due to several factors. The factors that influence the implementation of secure SDLC identified in public sector (the scope is State Secretary Offices in Malaysia) are inadequate development timeline, improper development team size and less awareness of team members' workload. It is agreed that integrating security at earlier (requirement and design) phase is the most effective and cheapest way to develop secure web application.

As the number of incidents on IOV has been on the rise in the past few years, IOV security is becoming increasingly important in the IOV architecture. One of the most notable risks of IOV faces is intelligent terminal security. The vehicle's intelligent terminal can be used to launch for further attacks on the on-board operating system to penetrate into the internal network of connected vehicle, and consequently threaten the safety of the vehicle.

The proposed protocols use the password and the vehicle owner's behavior features as the authentication factors to protect the security of the intelligent terminal. Since the vehicle owner's behavior features are sensitive and the privacy information of the user must be protected, we also consider the privacy protection of the behavior features. Our protocols do not reveal any information about the vehicle owner's behavior features to the authentication server and the adversary except the ciphertext size of the feature vector.

Due to the high degree of integration of cyber-physical systems, cyber attacks against various types of measurement data in smart grids are becoming more popular. As a result, the state estimation results for smart grid will be inaccurate, affecting the precise analysis and control of the smart grid’s current operating state. This paper proposes an ADMM-based distributed state estimate approach and a Markov attack detection mechanism to address the constraints of traditional state estimate and location of cyber-attacks. First, through separating power grid into many regions, we propose a distributed alternate direction state estimation approach based on multipliers that reduces the power system’s communication and computational expense. Second, by adopting presented combination attack model of false data injection attack and DoS attack, a Markov attack detecting mechanism based on distributed state estimate is developed. Finally, experimental results on the IEEE Bus-118 system demonstrate that our model has better efficiency and accuracy of suggested distributed state estimation and attack detection methods.",IEEE Xplore,2022 China Automation Congress (CAC),453

In turn, machine learning can be used to construct surrogate models approximating the system's security boundary in the region of operation. To this end, past system history can be useful for generating anticipated system states suitable for training. However, inferring the underlying data model, to allow high-density sampling, is problematic due to the large number of variables, their complex marginal probability distributions and the nonlinear dependence structure they exhibit. In this paper, we adopt the C-Vine pair-copula decomposition scheme; clustering and principal component transformation stages are introduced, followed by a truncation to the pairwise dependency modeling, enabling efficient fitting and sampling of large datasets.

The representation of protection functions greatly enhances the accuracy of the transient stability study and leads to a better understanding of power system states during emergency conditions. Although modeling all of the protective relays within transient stability studies may result in a better estimation of system behavior, representing, updating, and maintaining the protection system data becomes an insurmountable task. Inappropriate or outdated representation of the relays may result in incorrect assessment of the system behavior. This paper presents a systematic method to determine essential relays to be modeled in transient stability studies. The desired approach should identify protective relays that are critical for various operating conditions and contingencies. The proposed strategy is verified as a viable technique based on results obtained from the WECC 179-bus and the IEEE 145-bus test cases, while considering various operating states and contingencies.

Owing to its adaptive nature in delivering a dynamic rule base, it is particularly useful for those systems which experience frequent changes. Network security is one such area where frequent changes are quite likely due to changing network conditions and traffic. Thus, D-FRI has the potential to offer an optimised and adaptive approach for improving network security. The popular Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Firewall is capable of monitoring and alerting a range of common threats, by baselining the traffic of a network and analysing the statistics of dropped packets. An ASA process yields a large volume of statistical information relating to certain security events. Yet, threat detection is a rudimentary function since additional intelligence is required to automate the extraction of meaningful information for alerting the users. This could be achieved using expensive automated tools offered by a third party, but doing so may unnecessarily expose an organisation to other security threats. This paper takes a different approach, presenting a DFRI-CiscoFirewall in support of automated threat detection for Cisco ASA Firewall. Through utilising threat detection statistics, the approach can customise the detection process according to organisational requirements. It performs the relative analysis of prioritised security events and is able to predict comprehensive security situations while no matching rules are available. In particular, the approach supports the creation of a dynamic rule base, derived from changing network conditions and traffic density. Its efficacy is demonstrated by experimental evaluations.",IEEE Xplore,2019 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE),458

Nowak,10.1109/CTS.2010.5478463,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5478463,20100.0,IEEE Conferences,"The technological advances of the information age have created both an opportunity and a challenge for military decision makers. At first glance, the variety of data gathered by a multitude of traditional and non-traditional Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors should allow decision makers to better understand their environment and the threat. However, a number of factors tend to erode this advantage. Incompatible data formats, bandwidth limitations, sensor persistence and revisit rates, and multi-level security issues are but a few of the technical challenges that preclude end users from being able to take full advantage of the sensor information. Further, as the amount of sensor data increases, real challenges emerge in identifying the most salient pieces of information, fusing that with other relevant sensor modalities, and rapidly moving this information in a presentation format that does not overwhelm the decision maker. It was this problem space of improving information understanding to increase the situational awareness of decision makers that spawned the Layered Sensing vision. Layered Sensing has grown from an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate initiative into an AFRL effort that seeks to bring fused, multi-source, multi-spectral, multi-dimensional (e.g. cultural, environmental, etc.) information to decision makers consistent with their needs, regardless of their location. The end goal of Layered Sensing is to improve the situational awareness of decision makers by providing them with tailored sensor information. In essence, Layered Sensing is a Sensing Oriented Architecture where the customer can provide or request information tailored to their needs in order to facilitate situational awareness. The benefits of Layered Sensing extend beyond military application. For example, the Department of Homeland Security is one federal agency that could potentially face many of the same information challenge in operations as diverse as providing a common operating picture during a post-Katrina type reconstitution scenario or in fusing multi-source and multi-mode data (e.g. HUMINT, electronic intercepts, etc) in order to track or capture a suspected terrorist. Regardless of who implements a Layered Sensing architecture, the critical attribute of “trust” will have to be addressed - trusted information, trusted communication and trusted sensors. Trust is the sine qua non for any Layered Sensing implementation as it is difficult, if not impossible, to build situational awareness upon inaccurate, misleading, or maliciously modified information. The challenge of instilling and measuring trust in a system has many components. At the sensor node the issue of trust is one of ensuring the sensor works as intended and has not been compromised or co-opted. Between sensors, communications paths must be reliable, secure, and robust enough to recover from equipment degradation or malfunctions. Ideally, the local and global architecture should be autonomic with the ability to optimize sensor and communication performance. Finally, there needs to be a means to measure and portray the overall architecture trust picture status to those who are using it. The use of commercial off-the-shelf equipment, while cost effective, introduces its own trust issues due to uncontrollable supply chains. Relying solely on components from trusted sources is not feasible either economically or practically. As Layered Sensing moves from local architectures supporting an urban scenario to a global scenario the issue of complexity will arise. Seamlessly integrating a large number of spatially and temporally distributed heterogeneous sensors will require effective means to authenticate the new arrivals. Dynamic bandwidth allocation to account for optimal data transmission will also be important. Encompassing all of these trust issues is a way to measure and portray a “trust picture” to users. Instinctively, decision makers weigh the accuracy of data they receive based on their experiences with those data sources. For example, live-feed imagery will likely carry more weight in forming the user's situational awareness of a battle space rather than dated intelligence reports or HUMINT. For sensor derived information, the measure of trust of data is a function of the sensor, the environment it's operating in, the networks transmitting that data, and the fusion engine used to correlate the information. It's important these metrics of trust be available to the decision maker particularly if he/she is predisposed to rely on certain sensors/information sources over others. This conference represents the third time papers and studies have been presented that address the challenges associated with Layered Sensing. The purpose of this presentation is to provide a lead-in that introduces the concepts of Layered Sensing and lays the groundwork for subsequent session papers focused on the various aspects of trust.",IEEE Xplore,2010 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems,466

Our approach consists of an optimal extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based observer, which is a linearization with time. We consider the observer with messages and the input with keys to be the transmitting agents. The optimal linearization technique is utilized to obtain the exact linear models of a chaotic system for operating states of interest. An EKF algorithm is used to estimate the parameters and states in which the message is already embedded. By combining the EKF with our optimal linear model, the message can be recovered on the receiver end.

While the abundance of data could improve system efficiency, it poses major reliability challenges. In particular, state estimation aims to find the operating state of a network from the telemetered data, but an undetected attack on the data could lead to making wrong operational decisions for the system and trigger a large-scale blackout. Nevertheless, understanding the vulnerability of state estimation with regards to cyberattacks, which is a special instance of graph-structured quadratic sensing problem, has been hindered by the lack of tools for studying the topological and data-analytic aspects of networks. Algorithmic robustness is critical in extracting reliable information from abundant but untrusted grid data. For a large-scale power grid, we quantify, analyze, and visualize the regions of the network that are not robust to cyberattacks in the sense that there exists a data manipulation strategy for each of those local regions that misleads the operator at the global scale and yields a wrong estimation of the state of the network at almost all buses. We also propose an optimization-based graphical boundary defense mechanism to identify the border of the geographical area in which data have been manipulated. The proposed method does not allow a local attack to have a global effect on the data analysis of the entire network, which enhances the situational awareness of the grid, especially in the face of adversity. The developed mathematical framework reveals key geometric and algebraic factors that can affect algorithmic robustness and is used to study the vulnerability of the U.S. power grid in this paper.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,475

However, it suffers from various attacks as the cloud service provider and data owners are not in the same trusted domain. To support data confidentiality, existing cloud-based systems apply cryptographic tools to issue the decryption key to data users to share data in a controlled way. However, fine-grained cloud data sharing still faces many challenges, especially when dealing with dynamic user groups. In this paper, we introduce a secure and efficient cloud-based data-sharing system with fine-grained access control and dynamic user groups. Our system enjoys 1) adaptive security in prime-order groups, 2) forward secrecy against revoked user fetches data generated before being revoked, and 3) decryption key exposure resistance against the compromise of the frequently used decryption key, where the previous solutions only concentrate on one or two above-mentioned properties. More specifically, we introduce two timestamp management mechanisms that manage the timestamp in each ciphertext to support dynamic user groups with forward secrecy. By applying the proposed timestamp management mechanisms, we introduce two novel designs of attribute-based encryption schemes with formal definition and security analyses.

An outbreak in one region often triggers the spread of others, and regions with relatively close association would show a strong correlation in the spread of the epidemic. In the real world, many factors affect the spread of the outbreak between regions. These factors exist in the form of multimodal data, such as the time-series data of the epidemic, the geographic relationship, and the strength of social contacts between regions. However, most of the current work only uses historical epidemic data or single-modal geographic location data to forecast the spread of the epidemic, ignoring the correlation and complementarity in multi-modal data and its impact on the disease spread between regions.

In a normal operation mode, where the grid-connection is available, the energy and reserve of local resources and energy trading with the main grid is scheduled to maximize the operator's profit considering feasible islanding. In a resilient operating mode, which is triggered by a disturbance in the main grid, the local resources should be scheduled to supply loads with the lowest emergency load shedding. To balance the economy and security requirements under uncertainties, the optimal scheduling is done properly through a security-constrained power flow method by considering system's objectives and constraints.

The visual differences presented to the face have a significant effect on the recognition capabilities of the kinship systems. We argue that aggregating multiple visual knowledge can better describe the characteristics of the subject for precise kinship identification. Typically, the age-invariant features can represent more natural facial details. Such age-related transformations are essential for face recognition due to the biological effects of aging. However, the existing methods mainly focus on employing the single-view image features for kinship identification, while more meaningful visual properties such as race and age are directly ignored in the feature learning step. To this end, we propose a novel deep collaborative multi-modal learning (DCML) to integrate the underlying information presented in facial properties in an adaptive manner to strengthen the facial details for effective unsupervised kinship verification. Specifically, we construct a well-designed adaptive feature fusion mechanism, which can jointly leverage the complementary properties from different visual perspectives to produce composite features and draw greater attention to the most informative components of spatial feature maps. Particularly, an adaptive weighting strategy is developed based on a novel attention mechanism, which can enhance the dependencies between different properties by decreasing the information redundancy in channels in a self-adaptive manner. Moreover, we propose to use self-supervised learning to further explore the intrinsic semantics embedded in raw data and enrich the diversity of samples. As such, we could further improve the representation capabilities of kinship feature learning and mitigate the multiple variations from original visual images. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experimental evaluations conducted on four widely-used datasets show that our DCML method is always superior to some state-of-the-art kinship verification methods.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security,493

Risk-aware, real-time security constrained economic dispatch (RT-SCED) provides an efficient solution towards promptly, economically and robustly responding to the changes in the power system operating state. Despite different model-based methods have been developed to handle uncertainties, significant computation burden arise to incorporate $N$-1 contingency constraints with a higher temporal resolution in RT-SCED. Driven by similar computational challenges, risk evaluation is often overlooked in the current application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based data-driven methods in RT-SCED. This paper proposes a DRL-based risk-aware RT-SCED methodological framework by incorporating a novel data-driven risk evaluation model to foster efficient agent-environment interactions. The real-time dispatch policies are constructed with an improved twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient method. The policy network features a residual network architecture and incorporates an active power allocation mechanism to integrate empirical dispatch knowledge, preventing early termination and fostering more efficient learning behavior. Case studies validate the superior performance of the proposed method in risk-aware RT-SCED on cost efficiency, uncertainty adaptability and computational efficiency, through benchmarking against model-based and data-driven baseline methods.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,496

The templates crystallize general usability principles commonly addressed in user-centred safety requirements, such as the ability to undo user actions, the visibility of operational modes, and the predictability of user interface behavior. These requirements have standard forms across different application domains, and can be instantiated as properties of specific devices. The modeling and analysis process is carried out using the Prototype Verification System (PVS), and is further facilitated by structuring the specification of the device using a format that is designed to be generic across interactive systems. A concrete case study based on a commercial infusion pump is used to illustrate the approach.

Many counterfeits can be identified once installed, however even a tech-savvy user may struggle to detect them before installation as app icons and descriptions can be quite similar to the original app. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage the recent advances in deep learning methods to create image and text embeddings so that counterfeit apps can be efficiently identified when they are submitted to be published in app markets. We show that for the problem of counterfeit detection, a novel approach of combining content embeddings and style embeddings (given by the Gram matrix of CNN feature maps) outperforms the baseline methods for image similarity such as SIFT, SURF, LATCH, and various image hashing methods. We first evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two well-known datasets for evaluating image similarity methods and show that, content, style, and combined embeddings increase precision@k and recall@k by 10-15 percent and 12-25 percent, respectively when retrieving five nearest neighbours. Second specifically for the app counterfeit detection problem, combined content and style embeddings achieve 12 and 14 percent increase in precision@k and recall@k, respectively compared to the baseline methods. We also show that adding text embeddings further increases the performance by 5 and 6 percent in terms of precision@k and recall@k, respectively when $k$k is five. Third, we present an analysis of approximately 1.2 million apps from Google Play Store and identify a set of potential counterfeits for top-10,000 popular apps.

To build a robust model, we need to consider configuration-level specifications in addition to protocol specification.

Existing network monitoring technologies perform traffic analysis using specialized acceleration on network switches, or full inspection of packets in software, which can be complex, expensive, inflexible, and unscalable. In this paper, we use SDN paradigm combined with machine learning to leverage the benefits of programmable flow-based telemetry with flexible data-driven models to manage IoT devices based on their network activity. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We analyze traffic traces of 17 real consumer IoT devices collected in our lab over a six-month period and identify a set of traffic flows (per-device) whose time-series attributes computed at multiple timescales (from a minute to an hour) characterize the network behavior of various IoT device types, and their operating states (i.e., booting, actively interacted with user, or being idle); (2) We develop a multi-stage architecture of inference models that use flow-level attributes to automatically distinguish IoT devices from non-IoTs, classify individual types of IoT devices, and identify their states during normal operations. We train our models and validate their efficacy using real traffic traces; and (3) We quantify the trade-off between performance and cost of our solution, and demonstrate how our monitoring scheme can be used in operation for detecting behavioral changes (firmware upgrade or cyber attacks).",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,502

The increase of Internet-connected devices has caused attackers to focus their attention more on these devices. Therefore, new and more sophisticated attacks on IoT systems are discovered every day. Currently, to ensure reliability and operability, most IoT systems are designed to operate in a relatively static configuration in a highly heterogeneous environment. However, a system that does not continuously change its configurations, i.e., a static system, gives an advantage to attackers; with enough time and resources, an attacker will eventually find and exploit the vulnerabilities of any static target. This work proposes a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy that randomly shuffles the communication protocols through which a node communicates to a gateway in an IoT network. The system’s configuration changes have an associated cost. The objective of the proposed MTD strategy in this work is to balance the increase in system performance overhead, the increase in business impact (system unavailability), and, at the same time, the decrease in the probability of success of a given attack. A framework is proposed to design this strategy; this framework can guide any MTD strategy for IoT systems.

The authors present the first general treatment of the coercion problem in secure computation. They first present a general definition of protocols that provide resilience to coercion. Their definition constitutes a natural extension of the general paradigm used for defining secure multiparty protocols. They next show that if trapdoor permutations exist then any function can be incoercibly computed (i.e., computed by a protocol that provides resilience to coercion) in the presence of computationally bounded adversaries and only public communication channels. This holds as long as less than half the parties are coerced (or corrupted). In particular, theirs are the first incoercible protocols without physical security assumptions. Also, the protocols constitute an alternative solution to the recently solved adaptive security problem.

The existing formal-based approaches for enforcing security policies are mainly expressed using first-order logic. A major drawback of using first-order logic in implementing dynamic policies is that new observations cannot override previously inferred consequences. In fact, a security system whose enterprise policies are implemented using first-order logic is required to have complete access to data in advance in order to be able to perform an informed reasoning and enforce restricting policies. As a major problem, the systems designed based on these first order logic-based approaches are often static, inflexible, and hard to manage and scale. This paper introduces an approach for expressing and enforcing adaptive access control policies dynamically. The paper presents a non-monotonic formal approach based on Answer Set Programming where default policies are explicitly separated from context-dependent and exception policies that often occur in dynamic systems and in particular when the required context data are unavailable ahead of time.

Aside of obligatory clinical trials we need an extensive system of post-market surveillance, because: a medical device is a part of a complex cyber-physical system, with humans in the loop / the environment cannot be sufficiently defined / humans react differently to the therapy, they also behave differently / after every software upgrade the device is not the same as before In their operation such devices generate huge amounts of data that can be reused for such analysis.

Before deploying traditional CP-ABE in real mHealth applications, there are three concerns worth considering. First, the scale of pre-defined attribute universe is lack of scalability. Second, the plaintext access policy sent along with the ciphertext would leak the PHR owner’s privacy. Third, it is difficult to identify the malicious user who intentionally disclosed his (partial or modified) private key. In this paper, we present HTAC, a fine-grained policy-hiding and traceable access control scheme for mHealth. In HTAC, the attribute universe is exponentially large and unbounded. Each attribute is expressed by an attribute name and an attribute value. In the encryption phase, the value is hidden in the ciphertext and only the generic attribute name is exposed. The malicious user will be precisely identified by searching the identity linked with the suspicious private key in an identity table. We further extend HTAC by removing the identity table and assigning more explicitly responsibility for the authority and the trace center. Then the storage overhead of tracing the malicious users is constant. The security analysis and performance comparison indicate that HTAC and the extended scheme are secure and practicable for real mHealth.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Access,527

This is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation (GA). Robust and resilient detection, identification, localization, and tracking of sUAS sharing UAM airspace is complicated by urban factors such as non-transmitting, non-cooperative drones. Exacerbating these challenges, current technological limitations and vulnerabilities in Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can pose safety and security threats. To streamline a vision of safe and secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace, we propose Drone Net, a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) network of multi-modal ground and flight instruments. Drone Net is an architecture fusing a network of passive visual and acoustic sensor nodes with active Radio Detection and Ranging (radar) and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensing methods for UTM, designed for integration with existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and future UAM systems. The purpose of the Drone Net system is to evaluate use of Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic arrays networked within an urban UAS operating region such as uncontrolled Class-G and waiver-granted Class-D airspace. The Drone Net approach combines detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADS-B, and EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe, fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network. Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS that are both compliant and non-compliant alongside GA and UAM more safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more advanced scenarios between multiple UAS. The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time for analysis and security applications. More concrete applications for Drone Net include UTM integration with ATC and UAM, but also airspace safety and security for campus and public venues in general. Herein, we will present our experimental design and current test data from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in collaboration with University of Colorado Boulder toward completing the open specification for ground and flight instruments.

To address this problem, we proposed a fast and secure unbounded cross-domain proxy re-encryption scheme, named FABRIC, which enables the delegator to authorize the semi-trusted cloud server to convert one ciphertext of an identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme to another ciphertext of an attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme. As the first scheme to achieve the feature mentioned above, FABRIC not only enjoys constant computation overhead in the encryption, decryption, and re-encryption phases when the quantity of attributes increases, but is also unbounded such that the new attributes or roles could be adopted into the system anytime. Furthermore, FABRIC achieves adaptive security under the decisional linear assumption (DLIN). Eventually, detailed theoretical and experimental analysis proved that FABRIC enjoys excellent performance in efficiency and practicality in the cloud computing scenario.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,537

In particular, system operating states, critical attributes that act as input to the data-driven stability assessment, can be manipulated by malicious actors to mislead the system operator into making disastrous decisions and thus cause major blackouts and cascading events. In this article, we explore the vulnerability of the data-driven power system stability assessment, with a special emphasis on decision tree-based stability assessment (DTSA) approaches, and investigate the feasibility of constructing a physics-constrained adversarial attack (PCAA) to undermine the DTSA. The PCAA is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem considering the misclassification constraint, power limits, and bad data detection, computing potential adversarial perturbations that reverse the “stable/unstable” prediction of the real-time input while remaining invisible/stealthy.

However, security aspects are a major concern for IoT devices due to their applications and the amount of sensitive data they provide. Simultaneously, the energy constraint in IoT networks remains a significant issue due to their limited resources. To reduce their energy consumption, several IoT protocols have integrated the energy-saving mode which offers four operating modes. On the basis of these four states, we derive an analysis framework, named HARPAGON, allowing an attacker to maximize his attack efficiency and minimize his impact in terms of energy consumption. Indeed, the effectiveness of many attacks depends principally on the state of the attacker and the victim at the same time. HARPAGON with the help of Markov chain theory allows modeling the interaction between the attacker and its victims. In this article, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework coupled with a jamming attack by comparing it to other types of jamming attacks. Experimental results reveal HARPAGON combined with a jamming attack drastically reduces the performance of the network, with an impact on the packet error rate (PER), which is around 13% higher than the reactive attack and with a reduced energy budget in respect of the other two well-known “green” jamming attacks.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,540

The key observations that enable us to discover this sidechannel are: 1) in an effort to manage and minimize power consumption, modern microprocessors have a number of possible operating modes (power states) in which various sub-systems of the processor are powered down, 2) for some of the transitions between power states, the processor also changes the operating mode of the voltage regulator module (VRM) that supplies power to the affected sub-system, and 3) the electromagnetic (EM) emanations from the VRM are heavily dependent on its operating mode. As a result, these state-dependent EM emanations create a side-channel which can potentially reveal sensitive information about the current state of the processor and, more importantly, the programs currently being executed. To demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting this vulnerability, we create a covert channel by utilizing the changes in the processor's power states. We show how such a covert channel can be leveraged to exfiltrate sensitive information from a secured and completely isolated (air-gapped) laptop system by placing a compact, inexpensive receiver in proximity to that system. To further show the severity of this attack, we also demonstrate how such a covert channel can be established when the target and the receiver are several meters away from each other, including scenarios where the receiver and the target are separated by a wall. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed covert channel has >3x higher bit-rate. Finally, to demonstrate that this new vulnerability is not limited to being used as a covert channel, we demonstrate how it can be used for attacks such as keystroke logging.",IEEE Xplore,2020 IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA),542

Determining factors that significantly influence yield prediction and identify the most appropriate predictive methods are important in yield management. It is critical to consider and study the combination of different crop factors and their impact on the yield. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to use advanced data analytic techniques to precisely predict the soybean crop yields, (2) to identify the most influential features that impact soybean predictions, (3) to illustrate the ability of Fuzzy Rule-Based (FRB) sub-systems, which are self-organizing, self-learning, and data-driven, by using the recently developed Autonomous Learning Multiple-Model First-order (ALMMo-1) system, and (4) to compare the performance with other well-known methods. The ALMMo-1 system is a transparent model, which stakeholders can easily read and interpret. The model is a data-driven and composed of prototypes selected from the actual data. Many factors affect the yield, and data clouds can be formed in the feature/data space based on the data density. The data cloud is the key to the IF part of FRB sub-systems, while the THEN part (the consequences of the IF condition) illustrates the yield prediction in the form of a linear regression model, which consists of the yield features or factors. In addition, the model can determine the most influential features of the yield prediction online.

Existing published work on robustness either does not scale to large-scale dataset, or does not deal with multiple modalities. This work aims to study several key questions related to multi-modal learning through the lens of robustness: 1) Are multi-modal models necessarily more robust than uni-modal models? 2) How to efficiently measure the robustness of multi-modal learning? 3) How to fuse different modalities to achieve a more robust multi-modal model? To understand the robustness of the multi-modal model in a large-scale setting, we propose a density-based metric, and a convexity metric to efficiently measure the distribution of each modality in high-dimensional latent space. Our work provides a theoretical intuition together with empirical evidence showing how multi-modal fusion affects adversarial robustness through these metrics. We further devise a mix-up strategy based on our metrics to improve the robustness of the trained model. Our experiments on AudioSet [1] and Kinetics-Sounds [2] verify our hypothesis that multi-modal models are not necessarily more robust than their uni-modal counterparts in the face of adversarial examples.

The resulting violence or crime leads to terrible consequences. How to utilize reasonable means to predict the dangerous intentions of massive crowds and prevent the potential hazard to the public is significant for social security. A crowd monitoring and management system is an effective way to detect abnormal behavior. In this article, we release unmanned aerial vehicles as well as fixed ground devices to achieve multi-level and multi-modal behavioral sensing on a massive crowd, deploy a hybrid model in edge cloud to extract global features from behavioral data of a massive crowd, and then utilize these global features to construct decent classification algorithms for action recognition and behavioral semantic cognition. With the cooperation of behavioral data and cognitive algorithms, we can understand the instantaneous emotions of the crowd. On the basis of behavioral data and the emotional state of the crowd, the correlation between daily behavior and any dangerous intention of a massive crowd has been revealed by utilizing behavioral big data analysis, which is a key foundation for predicting people's dangerous intentions. Finally, we conduct a case study of abnormal behavior detection based on pix2pix and continuous video frames. The experimental results show that the performance of our method is better than other algorithms in both public datasets and the customized Hajj dataset.

However, the issue of attack strength did not get enough attention so that most existing resilient WADCs may fail to defend strong attacks. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multiple-controller switching approach based resilient wide-area damping controller (MCS-RWADC) to suppress inter-area oscillations and mitigate strong attacks. It is inclusive of multiple secure networked prediction control based modules (SNPMs) and a switch-monitor module (MSM). The SNPM can detect attacks, differentiate attack strength and compensate for weak attacks. In terms of strong attacks, multiple SNPMs are implemented to work as backup and three operating states as well as the corresponding switching rules are designed to realize automatic switching among them. MSM is responsible for monitoring the states and directing the switching. Case studies are conducted on a 4-area 5-terminal voltage source converter-based multi-terminal high voltage direct current based offshore wind farm integration system. Simulation results verify MCS-RWADC cannot only suppress the inter-area oscillation but also handle the strong attacks under a wide range of operating conditions with various wind power output.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,555

To address this, federated learning (FL) architecture can be applied to satellite MEC where only parameters and model updates can be transmitted, which avoids the interaction of raw data from diverse sources.

However, EFSM-based test case generation is susceptible to the infeasible (inexecutable) path problem, which stems from the conflict of predicates (guards) between transitions in the path. Therefore, in order to derive feasible test cases, a test generation algorithm needs to dynamically acquire information about the model and verify the feasibility of the generated test path through the simulation execution of the model. The traditional method of constructing executable models using hard-coding for different EFSM models under test has limitations such as inflexibility, time-consuming and error-prone. To address this issue, this paper proposes a parsing-based approach, PBACE, for building the executable EFSM for testing EFSM-specified systems, which can support the automatic generation of executable test cases. It decouples the EFSM model description, parsing and simulation execution functions from the test generation algorithm, which can effectively improve the efficiency and quality of test generation. In particular, PBACE first uses a well-designed JSON syntax to describe the specific EFSM under test. Then, based on the model description file, it uses lexical and syntactic parsers to dynamically extract model information to construct various model objects in memory such as state configurations, transitions, etc. Finally, the proposed method provides a series of service interfaces to support model information acquisition, transition feasibility evaluation, and model simulation execution.

These have a compounded effect on the quality of fault-tolerance exhibited by a DIS.

The special feature of these is the designing for operation in two modes: normal and emergency. Digital components can accumulate hidden failures over a long-term normal mode. This reduces their fault tolerance and functional safety of the system in the most responsible emergency mode. Two conditions for occurrence of the hidden fault problem as a growth one are considered in view of a resource approach, which in the development of models, methods and means highlights levels of replication and diversification. Safety-related systems are analyzed as computer systems that have increased to the level of diversification to address the security challenge. Their components are still stamped at a level of resource replication using matrix structures to process data in parallel codes. Fault-tolerant solutions become fault-safe with a sufficient level of circuit checkability, which is commonly known as testability, i.e. structural checkability, depending only on the structure of the circuit. In the operating mode, the checkability becomes structurally-functional, and in critical applications it is converted into a dual-mode, the shortage of which causes the hidden fault problem. A method of analyzing circuits for the possibility of hidden faults is suggested. The method is illustrated on example of an iterative array multiplier implemented in an FPGA project with a LUT-oriented architecture. A program model for the resulting scheme has been developed and potentially dangerous points have been found in it in which the hidden fault problem of may manifest itself.",IEEE Xplore,"2020 IEEE 15th International Conference on Advanced Trends in Radioelectronics, Telecommunications and Computer Engineering (TCSET)",565

Contracted cloud computing is unlike other operational modes and also unlike other managed IT service arrangements.

Perhaps most intriguing of all, the data owner does not actually have physical access to the places and devices where that information is. The customer has all the responsibility and liability for protecting the information according to legal standards and regulation but often cannot mandate the actual protections and security measures in order to accomplish this. This leads to a very complex situation with a number of unique considerations. Some element of adversarial relationship exists between the cloud customer and cloud vendor because they have somewhat different goals. The cloud customer wants to maximize their computing capabilities and security of information while minimizing their costs. The cloud vendor wants to maximize its profits while minimizing what it has to provide (which is expressed in terms of computing capabilities and security of information). The primary intent for the cloud customer should be to meet business requirements.

IoT devices collect or produce huge multi-modal data that is either processed on the edge or sent to a central cloud for processing. The collected data sets are pre-processed by methods known as “feature selection”, to remove redundant, irrelevant, or noisy features. Feature selection will help with improving the results achieved by the learning method as well as reducing the computational complexity of the model. The goal is to select the most informative features of data and only transmit the selected features to the edge/cloud servers for further processing. This leads to smaller costs for data transmission to the servers. In this paper, a novel wrapper-based federated feature selection (FFS) algorithm is proposed, where IoT devices collaborate to select the most informative features without sharing their local data sets. The proposed FFS algorithm uses binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA) in a federated and collaborative manner to select a small enough subset of informative attributes and provide an improved trade-off between communication cost and learning accuracy. Our experimental results on three data sets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and MAV demonstrate that the proposed BGSAFFS method can in average remove more than 50% of features without losing information.

In a lockable obfuscation scheme there exists an obfuscation algorithm Obf that takes as input a security parameter, a program P, a message msg and lock value lck and outputs an obfuscated program oP. One can evaluate the obfuscated program oP on any input x where the output of evaluation is the message msg if P(x) = lck and otherwise receives a rejecting symbol. We proceed to provide a construction of lockable obfuscation and prove it secure under the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption. Notably, our proof only requires LWE with polynomial hardness and does not require complexity leveraging. We follow this by describing multiple applications of lockable obfuscation. First, we show how to transform any attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme into one in which the attributes used to encrypt the message are hidden from any user that is not authorized to decrypt the message. (Such a system is also know as predicate encryption with one-sided security.) The only previous construction due to Gorbunov, Vaikuntanathan and Wee is based off of a specific ABE scheme of Boneh. By enabling the transformation of any ABE scheme we can inherent different forms and features of the underlying scheme such as: multi-authority, adaptive security from polynomial hardness, regular language policies, etc. We also show applications of lockable obfuscation to separation and uninstantiability results. We first show how to create new separation results in circular encryption that were previously based on indistinguishability obfuscation. This results in new separation results from learning with error including a public key bit encryption scheme that it IND-CPA secure and not circular secure. The tool of lockable obfuscation allows these constructions to be almost immediately realized by translation from previous indistinguishability obfuscation based constructions. In a similar vein we provide random oracle uninstantiability results of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation (and related transformations) from the lockable obfuscation combined with fully homomorphic encryption. Again, we take advantage that previous work used indistinguishability obfuscation that obfuscated programs in a form that could easily be translated to lockable obfuscation.",IEEE Xplore,2017 IEEE 58th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS),575

Inside AIRBUS Defence & Space, the focus on X-band antennas today is on airborne and fighter nose radars, in satellite based SAR antennas (synthetic aperture radar) for earth observation, and ground surveillance and security radars. Active airborne antennas are assembled with hundreds or even thousands of transmit/receive modules. This paper will describe the evolution of the so-called standardized module solution based on LTCC package technology with special regard to airborne applications and the correlated needs. This evolution especially contains significant optimization steps concerning area, weight and cost. By realization of an SMTR® Module suitable to a folded plank concept a significant reduction of installation depth could be achieved. As the module weight is dominated by its package, technology evaluation and implementation of advantageous concepts and materials was performed, here. Cost reduction is always a key focus of T/R module evolution as the modules still allocate a big part of antenna's production cost. Some steps have been realised here both on technology and component level. The next generation of AESA antennas will result in a combination of different operating modes within the same antenna front end, including radar, communication (data links), and jamming (electronic warfare, EW). This leads to enhanced demands especially towards the MMICs. The RF section of today's T/R modules for AESA applications is typically based on GaAs technology. During the last 10 years there was much progress in the development of disruptive semiconductor materials, especially GaN and SiGe BiCMOS, which have the potential to challenge or even replace the GaAs technology, here. This paper will describe and show this evolution through the last years and shall give an outlook towards future developments with regard to airborne applications.",IEEE Xplore,2014 International Radar Conference,577

Motivated by the ubiquity of commercial cloud platforms, data owners are willing to store their graph databases remotely. However, data privacy has emerged as a widespread concern since the cloud platforms are not fully trusted. One viable solution is to encrypt sensitive data before outsourcing, which inevitably hinders data retrieval. To enable queries over encrypted data, searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) has been introduced. Yet, the most well-studied class of SSE schemes focuses on retrieving textual files given keywords, which cannot be applied to graph databases directly. This paper extends our preliminary work (FC’17) and proposes GraphShield, a structured encryption scheme for graphs. Beyond shortest distance queries, GraphShield can support other classic graph-based queries (e.g., maximum flow) and more complicated analytics (e.g., PageRank). Technically, we incorporate a suite of (efficient) cryptographic primitives and tailor some extra secure protocols for facilitating graph analytics. Our scheme also allows updates on the encrypted graph with forward privacy guaranteed. We formalize the security model and prove the adaptive security with reasonable leakage. Finally, we implement our scheme on various real-world datasets, and the experiment results demonstrate its practicality and scalability.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,578

In this paper, we explore a novel and practical multi-modal side-channel keystroke recognition system, named ClickLeak, which can infer the PIN code/password entered on numeric keypad by using the commodity Wi-Fi devices. Such numeric keypads are commonly available in many public social environments. ClickLeak is built on the observation that each key input makes unique pattern of hand and finger movements, and this generates unique distortions to multi-path Wi-Fi signals. Acceleration and microphone sensors of smart phones determine the starting and ending time of keystrokes, while the time series of channel state information are analyzed to determine the keystrokes.

Urban airspace will include many more Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and related accidents and mishaps will also increase. Applications of UAVs in urban environments include photography and film-making, security monitoring, real estate, construction, property and infrastructure inspections, leisure, public safety (fires, natural disasters, investigations), traffic, and much more. Emerging UAV applications include last-mile drone delivery services. This paper discusses urban scenarios where drones are more ubiquitous. Monitoring and related safety of these UAVs will be increasingly important. Though multi-modal purpose-built drone tracking and monitoring systems will be the most effective solution for detection and tracking of these RPAS, during the transition to more regular drone use in urban areas and in everyday urban applications, a more rapid-deployment and agile detection system is needed that does not require installation of hardware.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The development and deployment of a fully connected transportation system that makes the most of multi-modal, transformational applications requires a robust, underlying technological platform. The platform is a combination of well-defined technologies, interfaces, and processes that, combined, ensure safe, stable, interoperable, reliable system operations that minimize risk and maximize opportunities. The primary application area of connected vehicles is the vehicle safety. These applications are designed to increase situational awareness and reduce or eliminate crashes through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) data transmission that supports: driver advisories, driver warnings, and vehicle and/or infrastructure controls. These technologies may potentially address a great majority of crash scenarios with unimpaired drivers, preventing tens of thousands of automobile crashes every year. Since V2V and V2I communications and a significant data processing are involved, the connected vehicles concept also requires resiliency and immunity for cyber security issues.

They do so by monitoring and analysing this environment, and deploying security functions that satisfy some protection (security, privacy, or forensic) requirements. In this paper, we suggest that a key characteristic for engineering adaptive security is the topology of the operational environment, which represents a physical and/or a digital space - including its structural relationships, such as containment, proximity, and reachability. For adaptive security, topology expresses a rich representation of context that can provide a system with both structural and semantic awareness of important contextual characteristics. These include the location of assets being protected or the proximity of potentially threatening agents that might harm them. Security-related actions, such as the physical movement of an actor from a room to another in a building, may be viewed as topological changes. The detection of a possible undesired topological change (such as an actor possessing a safe’s key entering the room where the safe is located) may lead to the decision to deploy a particular security control to protect the relevant asset. This position paper advocates topology awareness for more effective engineering of adaptive security. By monitoring changes in topology at runtime one can identify new or changing threats and attacks, and deploy adequate security controls accordingly. The paper elaborates on the notion of topology and provides a vision and research agenda on its role for systematically engineering adaptive security systems.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 9th International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems,583

Our interdisciplinary study reported in this article (1) draws on the psychology literature to provide conceptual underpinnings for three categories of impediments to achieving security goals, (2) reports on an in-depth meta-analysis of existing software security literature that identified a catalogue of factors that influence developers' security decisions, and (3) characterises the landscape of existing security interventions that are available to the developer during coding and identifies gaps. Collectively, these show that different forms of impediments to achieving security goals arise from different contributing factors. Interventions will be more effective where they reflect psychological factors more sensitively and marry technical sophistication, psychological frameworks, and usability.

Current CA proposals, however, have largely neglected adversaries present in a real-world deployment, namely the ubiquity of mal ware and software attacks. This has particular importance when a device cannot be trusted by a third-party, such as a corporation, that controls access to assets based on that decision. A software compromise, either on the scheme implementation or platform, may enable an adversary to modify authentication scores to alter the status of the device in reality, give insights into user behaviour, or gain unauthorised access to restricted assets. Hence, for the first time, we examine two standardised constructs that offer isolated and trusted execution - Secure Elements (SEs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) - even when an adversary has root-level privileges, and propose measures for providing trusted CA while retaining deployability. Based on these, we implement the first system for evaluating TEE-based CA on a consumer mobile device using Intel SGX, thus providing confidentiality, integrity and trust while removing the main platform from the TCB. We present an empirical evaluation of TEE-and non-TEE performance using methods proposed in related CA schemes.

Therefore, it is necessary to perform trade-off analysis among non-functional requirements to establish balance among them. In this paper, we target the timing requirements of real-time embedded systems, and introduce an approach for choosing appropriate encryption algorithms at runtime, to achieve satisfaction of timing requirements in an adaptive way, by monitoring and keeping a log of their behaviors.

This vision has since expanded to include a more diverse range of devices, services and networks to become an Internet of anything, anywhere, connected, anyhow. Security and privacy management for the IoT remains a core challenge.Many IoT devices maybe may have zero or minimal security by design because they are low resource, low power devices, designed to work as closed vertical services. Security threats and risks may be higher because devices are unattended, use local wireless communication that have no or weak encryption making them more susceptible to eavesdropping and because users find security too unusable to setup and operate and hence leave devices relatively unsecure. It may also be less problematic to reproduce and fake data sources, access nodes and data sinks that interact with IoT devices in order to attack devices or the services they access. Devices can be moved between or removed from private, communal, public and hostile physical spaces. There is a higher risk of a loss of privacy for human users and organisations because of an increased ability to eavesdrop, because of wireless networks with soft boundaries, and because embedded environment devices can sense smaller amounts of physical trails with a greater degree of sensitivity and accuracy. A specific focus is on the need for IoT security to adapt. The adaptation has multiple dimensions. We can adapt existing conventional security models to more effectively secure an IoT. We can adapt security pre-planned and unplanned context changes such as different moving around in different physical spaces. IoT systems can be designed to self-adapt. IoT systems need to adapt to the active (re) configuration and maintenance of IoT devices and systems of devices by users and by artificial agents.The proposed workshop intends to bring together researchers and practitioners from relevant fields to present and disseminate the latest on-going research focussing on adapting security, privacy & management for the Internet of Things.

Consider, for example, systems controlling electric power plants and e-banking servers. Nevertheless, security patches and a constant stream of new operating system versions need to be deployed without stopping running programs. These factors naturally lead to a pressing demand for live update---upgrading all or parts of the operating system without rebooting. Unfortunately, existing solutions require significant manual intervention and thus work reliably only for small operating system patches.In this paper, we describe an automated system for live update that can safely and automatically handle major upgrades without rebooting. We have implemented our ideas in Proteos, a new research OS designed with live update in mind. Proteos relies on system support and nonintrusive instrumentation to handle even very complex updates with minimal manual effort. The key novelty is the idea of state quiescence, which allows updates to happen only in safe and predictable system states. A second novelty is the ability to automatically perform transactional live updates at the process level, ensuring a safe and stable update process. Unlike prior solutions, Proteos supports automated state transfer, state checking, and hot rollback. We have evaluated Proteos on 50 real updates and on novel live update scenarios. The results show that our techniques can effectively support both simple and complex updates, while outperforming prior solutions in terms of flexibility, security, reliability, and stability of the update process.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the Eighteenth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems,601

In particular, we propose decoupling the operating system kernel from user processes by running each on completely separate processor cores instead of at different privilege levels within shared cores. Without using the hardware's privilege modes, virtualization and virtual memory contexts enforce the security policies necessary to maintain process isolation and protection. Our new kernel design paradigm offers the opportunity to simultaneously increase both performance and security; utilizing the hardware facilities for inter-core communication in place of those for privilege mode switching offers the opportunity for increased system call performance, while the hard separation between user processes and the kernel provides several strong security properties.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 2016 New Security Paradigms Workshop,607

It does it by dividing private keys into n shares handed out to distinct servers. In threshold signature schemes, a set of at least t+1 ≤ n servers is needed to produce a valid digital signature. Availability is assured by the fact that any subset of t+1 servers can produce a signature when authorized. At the same time, the scheme should remain robust (in the fault tolerance sense) and unforgeable (cryptographically) against up to t corrupted servers; i.e., it adds quorum control to traditional cryptographic services and introduces redundancy. Originally, most practical threshold signatures have a number of demerits: They have been analyzed in a static corruption model (where the set of corrupted servers is fixed at the very beginning of the attack), they require interaction, they assume a trusted dealer in the key generation phase (so that the system is not fully distributed), or they suffer from certain overheads in terms of storage (large share sizes). In this paper, we construct practical fully distributed (the private key is born distributed), non-interactive schemes --- where the servers can compute their partial signatures without communication with other servers--- with adaptive security (i.e., the adversary corrupts servers dynamically based on its full view of the history of the system). Our schemes are very efficient in terms of computation, communication, and scalable storage (with private key shares of size O(1), where certain solutions incur O(n) storage costs at each server). Unlike other adaptively secure schemes, our schemes are erasure-free (reliable erasure is a hard to assure and hard to administer property in actual systems).To the best of our knowledge, such a fully distributed highly constrained scheme has been an open problem in the area. In particular, and of special interest, is the fact that Pedersen's traditional distributed key generation (DKG) protocol can be safely employed in the initial key generation phase when the system is born -- although it is well-known not to ensure uniformly distributed public keys. An advantage of this is that this protocol only takes one round optimistically (in the absence of faulty player).",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 2014 ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing,608

Secure systems provide capabilities that enable such protection to satisfy some security requirements. In a world increasingly populated with mobile and ubiquitous computing technology, the scope and boundary of security systems can be uncertain and can change. A single functional component, or even multiple components individually, are often insufficient to satisfy complex security requirements on their own. Adaptive security aims to enable systems to vary their protection in the face of changes in their operational environment. Collaborative security, which we propose in this paper, aims to exploit the selection and deployment of multiple, potentially heterogeneous, software-intensive components to collaborate in order to meet security requirements in the face of changes in the environment, changes in assets under protection and their values, and the discovery of new threats and vulnerabilities. However, the components that need to collaborate may not have been designed and implemented to interact with one another collaboratively. To address this, we propose a novel framework for collaborative security that combines adaptive security, collaborative adaptation and an explicit representation of the capabilities of the software components that may be needed in order to achieve collaborative security. We elaborate on each of these framework elements, focusing in particular on the challenges and opportunities afforded by (1) the ability to capture, represent, and reason about the capabilities of different software components and their operational context, and (2) the ability of components to be selected and mediated at runtime in order to satisfy the security requirements.

Two new technologies make this scaling possible without any virtualization software: (1) self-transition management and (2) unified virtual address mapping. Evaluations show that this domain control provides highly scalable performance and incurs almost no performance overhead in security-domains. The increase in OSs in binary code size is less than 1.5%, and the time required for individual state transitions is on the order of a single millisecond.

The goal is to protect the system against insider threats by adapting at run-time the access control policies associated with system resources, and access rights assigned to users.

In this paper, we propose a formal technique to perform security analysis on the Generalized Temporal RBAC (GTRBAC) model which can be used to express a wide range of temporal constraints on different RBAC components like role, user and permission. In the proposed approach, at first the GTRBAC system is mapped to a state transition system built using timed automata. Characteristics of each role, user and permission are captured with the help of timed automata. A single global clock is used to express the various temporal constraints supported in a GTRBAC model. Next, a set of safety and liveness properties is specified using computation tree logic (CTL). Model checking based formal verification is then done to verify the properties against the model to determine if the system is secure with respect to a given set of access control policies.

This event was designed to provide student led teams a simulated operational business environment in which they could test their skills at information security and system operation. This three day event included external hackers attacking the student networks, as well as business users placing operational and administrative demands on the teams. Teams were scored based on their ability to maintain mandated business services, keeping hackers out and answering business scenario injects. The objective was to provide an environment where the teams could exercise their information technology abilities and do so in an operational mode where most information was not freely provided, but must be uncovered and discovered by the students in real time. Issues such as prioritization, resource allocation and technical skill application were tested using real world examples on a known instrumented network. The objective of providing feedback to each team as to its skill level and abilities was achieved and then some over the course of this successful event. Lessons were learned which are being used to move this local event to a national level event.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 2nd Annual Conference on Information Security Curriculum Development,614

Virtualization introduces additional overhead that often relates to memory management, interrupt handling and hypervisor mode switching. Among those, memory management and translation lookaside buffer (TLB) management have been shown to have a significant impact on the performance of systems. Two principal mechanisms for TLB management exist in today's systems, namely software and hardware managed TLBs. In this paper, we analyze and quantify the overhead of a pure software virtualization that is implemented over a software managed TLB. We then describe our design of hardware extensions to support virtualization in systems with software managed TLBs to remove the most dominant overheads. These extensions were implemented in the Power embedded A2 core, which is used in the PowerEN and in the Blue Gene/Q processors. They were used to implement a KVM port. We evaluate each of these hardware extensions to determine their overall contributions to performance and efficiency. Collectively these extensions demonstrate an average improvement of 232% over a pure software implementation.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 40th Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture,615

Besides these approaches, two other techniques, REpresentational State Transfer, and web services are applied for the realization of Service-Oriented Architecture. Web services provide a platform independent communication scheme between applications. The security preservation among the composition of services is an important task for Service-Oriented Architecture. In this study, an attempt is made to incorporate security features in Service- Oriented Architecture with the help of software security patterns. This scheme is described by developing an architectural model integrated with security goals and security patterns. The structural and behavioral aspects of composition of web services incorporated with security features are presented using a Unified Modeling Language class diagram and a sequence diagram respectively.

A fundamental aspect of a security model is a proof that validates that every state reachable from a secure initial state is secure. A sequential security model assumes that every command that acts as a state transition executes sequentially, while a concurrent security model assumes that multiple commands execute concurrently. This paper presents a security model called the Centralized-Parallel-Distributed model (CPD model) that defines security for logically, or physically centralized, parallel, and distributed systems. The purpose of the CPD model is to define concurrency conditions that guarentee that a concurrent system cannot reach a state in which privileges are configured in a nonsecure manner.

It has been one of the hottest research domains for decades to validate security models' correctness by formal methods during the development of security operating systems. However, current studies on the formal verification of security models are sometimes too sophisticated for the developers of operating systems, who are usually not experts in mathematical reasoning and proving. So representing a security model in UML becomes a compromise choice for the developers' verification work during system developing. In this paper, we propose a new method to verify the security policy model against the security goals using model checker SPIN and UML modeling language. Given a security policy model and the security property to be validated, our approach leverages UML class diagrams and statechart diagrams to specify its state model and its state transitions respectively. Then we translate these UML diagrams into the input language of SPIN automatically, as well as the security property. The conformance between the security goal and security model can finally be analyzed by SPIN. We proved the effectiveness of our approach by checking the violation of confidentiality of the DBLP model.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks,618

The approach considers internal event data related to the target system (e.g., users, physical, and logical resources, IP addresses, port numbers, etc.), and external event data related to the attacker (e.g., knowledge, motivation, skills, etc.) that can be obtained a priori and a posteriori. Internal data is used to model the base of the pyramid, whereas external data is used to model its height. In addition, the approach considers state transitions taken by the attacker to model the steps of a multi-stage attack to reach to its final goal. As a result, for each modeled state, new countermeasures are evaluated and the attacker's knowledge a posteriori changes accordingly, making it possible to evaluate the impact of the attack at time Ti, where i denotes the stage at which the attack is executed. A graphical representation of the impact of each evaluated event is depicted for visualization purposes.

The definition of privacy can take many forms, starting from the right to be forgotten beside being away from public attention. Although the pseudonymity of the user within the network can enhance the user's privacy, several pieces of research have studied the techniques to take advantage of the network structure to identify the users of pseudonyms. Moreover, two models have been used to record the updated exchange of values within the blockchain system, which are the unspent transaction output (UTXO) and the balance model. The UTXO suffers from duplication of information and the balance model suffers from having a single point of entry.

The solution has introduced a novel approach of initiating the transaction from the receiver side by taking advantage of mobile agents empowering a topology hiding to the network.

Specifically, we sought to determine if an SIS-mediated architecture could provide better protection against unauthorized and malicious safety instrument configuration changes than could a MUX-mediated architecture. An assessment question-driven approach was layered on top of standard penetration assessment methods. Test cases were planned around the questions and a sample set of vendor products typically used in the oil and gas sector. Four systems were composed from different product subsets and were assessed using the test cases. We analyzed results from the four assessments to illuminate issues that existed regardless of system composition. Analysis revealed recurring vulnerabilities that exist in all safety systems due to issues in the design of safety instruments and the HART protocol. We found that device-native hardware write-protections provide the best defense, followed by SIS write protections. We concluded that, when using SIS security controls, an SIS-mediated system can protect against unauthorized device reconfigurations better than can a MUX-based system. When SIS security controls are not used, there is no added security benefit.

Programmers and security professionals need a framework to reason about the effects of speculation and other microarchitectural performance optimizations. We propose judiciously extending the ISA to include the extra-architectural state so that an ISA implementation either completely squashes all system state changes caused by mis-speculated instructions or the potential changes are rigorously documented.

Due to natural or human-made (malicious and non-malicious) faults this property can be violated. Therefore, many methodologies and patterns that check or verify the integrity of systems or data have been introduced. However, integrity as a property cannot be identified directly. Existing methodologies tackle this problem by identifying other, computable, properties of the system and use a policy that describes how these properties reflect the integrity of the overall system. It is thus a critical task to select the right properties that reflect the integrity of a system in such a way that given integrity requirements are met. To ease this process, we introduce two new patterns, Static Integrity Properties and Dynamic Integrity Properties to classify the properties. Static Integrity Properties are used to ensure the integrity of a component prior it's use (e.g., the integrity of an executable binary), while Dynamic Integrity Properties are used to ensure the integrity of a component during run-time (e.g., properties that reflect the component's behavior or state transitions). Based on an exemplary embedded control system, we show typical use cases to help the system or software architect to choose the right class of integrity properties for the targeted system.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 21st European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs,630

Enclaves comprise code and data that is executed under special protection of the CPU and can only be accessed via an enclave defined interface. To facilitate the usability of this new system abstraction, Intel offers a software development kit (SGX SDK). While the SDK eases the use of SGX, it misses appropriate programming support for inter-enclave interaction, and demands to hardcode the exact use of trusted execution into applications, which restricts flexibility.This paper proposes EActors, an actor framework that is tailored to SGX and offers a more seamless, flexible and efficient use of trusted execution -- especially for applications demanding multiple enclaves. EActors disentangles the interaction with enclaves and, among them, from costly execution mode transitions. It features lightweight fine-grained parallelism based on the concept of actors, thereby avoiding costly SGX SDK provided synchronisation constructs. Finally, EActors offers a high degree of freedom to execute actors, either untrusted or trusted, depending on security requirements and performance demands. We implemented two use cases on top of EActors: (i) a secure instant messaging service, and (ii) a secure multi-party computation service.

Security- and safety-critical applications require access control policies that define how these resources interact to ensure that malicious and unsafe behaviors do not occur.

Takens' theorem in nonlinear dynamics allows reconstruction of topologically invariant, time-delay-embedding states from the computer dynamics in a sufficiently high-dimensional space.

One approach to this defense strategy is to intermittently change a system's configuration. These changes must maintain functionality and security, while also being diverse. Finding suitable configuration changes that form a MT defense is challenging. There are potentially a large number of individual configurations' settings to consider, without a full understanding of the settings' interdependencies.Evolution-based algorithms, which formulate better solutions from good solutions, can be used to create a MT defense. New configurations are created based on the security of previous configurations and can be periodically implemented to change the system's attack surface. This approach not only has the ability to discover new, more secure configurations, but is also proactive and resilient since it can continually adapt to the current environment in a fashion similar to systems found in nature.This article presents and compares two genetic algorithms to create a MT defense. The primary difference between the two is based on their approaches to mutation.

However, SoAs make use of verbose networking technologies and require reliable and relatively high bandwidth communications. Tactical scenarios normally cannot rely on such infrastructure and events like natural disasters can severely damage the network infrastructure in rural and urban environments. Thus, there is a need to develop solutions that provide SoA-based application and services running on heterogeneous and often constrained devices that compose tactical and mobile ad-hoc networks with Quality of Service (QoS) levels that meet their requirements. This paper presents the QoS-enabling features and the gateway operational mode (GM) of ACM NetProxy, the network proxy component of a communications middleware specifically developed to support applications in challenged networks.

Providing a holistic security assessment for networks consisting of several hundreds hosts is hardly feasible though without some sort of mechanization. Mitigation, prioritizing counter-measures subject to a given budget, currently lacks a solid theoretical understanding and is hence more art than science. In this work, we propose the first approach for conducting comprehensive what-if analyses in order to reason about mitigation in a conceptually well-founded manner. To evaluate and compare mitigation strategies, we use simulated penetration testing, i.e., automated attack-finding, based on a network model to which a subset of a given set of mitigation actions, e.g., changes to the network topology, system updates, configuration changes etc. is applied. Using Stackelberg planning, we determine optimal combinations that minimize the maximal attacker success (similar to a Stackelberg game), and thus provide a well-founded basis for a holistic mitigation strategy. We show that these Stackelberg planning models can largely be derived from network scan, public vulnerability databases and manual inspection with various degrees of automation and detail, and we simulate mitigation analysis on networks of different size and vulnerability.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 34th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing,636

Two refinement relations used in these patterns are formally defined. For each pattern, proof obligations are proposed to ensure preservation of behaviour through refinement. The proposed refinement relations essentially consist in preserving scenarios by replacing abstract events with concrete events, or by introducing new events. Deadlocks cannot be introduced; divergence over new events is allowed in one of the refinement relation. We prove congruence-like properties for these three patterns, in order to show that they can be applied to a subpart of a specification while preserving global properties.

Existing software and hardware approaches for finding and identifying memory bugs have a number of drawbacks including considerable performance overheads, target only a specific type of bug, implementation cost, and inefficient use of computational resources.This article describes MemTracker, a new hardware support mechanism that can be configured to perform different kinds of memory access monitoring tasks. MemTracker associates each word of data in memory with a few bits of state, and uses a programmable state transition table to react to different events that can affect this state. The number of state bits per word, the events to which MemTracker reacts, and the transition table are all fully programmable. MemTracker's rich set of states, events, and transitions can be used to implement different monitoring and debugging checkers with minimal performance overheads, even when frequent state updates are needed. To evaluate MemTracker, we map three different checkers onto it, as well as a checker that combines all three. For the most demanding (combined) checker with 8 bits state per memory word, we observe performance overheads of only around 3%, on average, and 14.5% worst-case across different benchmark suites. Such low overheads allow continuous (always-on) use of MemTracker-enabled checkers, even in production runs.",ACM Digital Library,ACM Trans. Archit. Code Optim.,640

However, significant issues w.r.t. system throughput, transaction confidentiality, and the security guarantee of the DApp transaction execution and order correctness hinder the border adoption of blockchain DApps.To address these issues, we propose L2chain, a novel blockchain framework aiming to scale the system through a layer-2 network where DApps process transactions in the layer-2 network and only the system state digest, acting as the state integrity proof, is maintained on-chain. To achieve high performance, we introduce the split-execute-merge (SEM) transaction processing workflow with the help of the RSA accumulator, allowing DApps to lock and update a part of the state digest in parallel. We also design a witness cache mechanism for DApp executors to reduce the transaction processing latency. To fulfill confidentiality, we leverage the trusted execution environment (TEE) for DApps to execute encrypted transactions off-chain. To ensure transaction execution and order correctness, we propose a two-step execution process for DApps to prevent attacks (i.e., rollback attacks) from subverting the state transition.

To balance the security, performance, and costs, a DApp typically consists of two layers: an on-chain layer to execute transactions and store crucial data on the blockchain and an off-chain layer to interact with users. A DApp needs to synchronize its off-chain layer with the on-chain layer proactively. Otherwise, the inconsistent data in the off-chain layer could mislead users and cause undesirable consequences, e.g., loss of transaction fees. However, transactions sent to the blockchain are not guaranteed to be executed and could even be reversed after execution due to chain reorganization. Such non-determinism in the transaction execution is unique to blockchain. DApp developers may fail to perform the on-chain-off-chain synchronization accurately due to their lack of familiarity with the complex transaction lifecycle. In this work, we investigate the challenges of synchronizing on-chain and off-chain data in Ethereum-based DApps. We present two types of bugs that could result in inconsistencies between the on-chain and off-chain layers. To help detect such on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs, we introduce a state transition model to guide the testing of DApps and propose two effective oracles to facilitate the automatic identification of bugs. We build the first testing framework, ÐArcher, to detect on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs in DApps. We have evaluated ÐArcher on 11 popular real-world DApps. ÐArcher achieves high precision (99.3%), recall (87.6%), and accuracy (89.4%) in bug detection and significantly outperforms the baseline methods. It has found 15 real bugs in the 11 DApps.

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional per character state processing and state transition detection paradigm. The main focus of existing schemes is in optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of reduced number of operations and states using out-of-sequence detection methods have not been explored. In this paper, we propose Looka-head Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection using very small amount of memory. LaFA's memory requirement is very small due to the following three areas of effort described in this paper: (1) Different parts of a RegEx, namely RegEx components, are detected using different detectors, each of which is specialized and optimized for the detection of a certain RegEx component. (2) We systematically reorder the RegEx component detection sequence, which provides us with new possibilities for memory optimization. (3) Many redundant states in classical finite automata are identified and eliminated in LaFA. Our simulations show that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. A single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes.

All these attacks are centered around a common set of behaviors: During speculative execution, the architectural state of the system is kept unmodified, until the speculation can be verified. In the event that a misspeculation occurs, then anything that can affect the architectural state is reverted (squashed) and re-executed correctly. However, the same is not true for the microarchitectural state. Normally invisible to the user, changes to the microarchitectural state can be observed through various side-channels, with timing differences caused by the memory hierarchy being one of the most common and easy to exploit. The speculative side-channels can then be exploited to perform attacks that can bypass software and hardware checks in order to leak information. These attacks, out of which the most infamous are perhaps Spectre and Meltdown, have led to a frantic search for solutions.In this work, we present our own solution for reducing the microarchitectural state-changes caused by speculative execution in the memory hierarchy. It is based on the observation that if we only allow accesses that hit in the L1 data cache to proceed, then we can easily hide any microarchitectural changes until after the speculation has been verified. At the same time, we propose to prevent stalls by value predicting the loads that miss in the L1. Value prediction, though speculative, constitutes an invisible form of speculation, not seen outside the core. We evaluate our solution and show that we can prevent observable microarchitectural changes in the memory hierarchy while keeping the performance and energy costs at 11% and 7%, respectively. In comparison, the current state of the art solution, InvisiSpec, incurs a 46% performance loss and a 51% energy increase.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 46th International Symposium on Computer Architecture,645

Using Kubernetes, Cruise has built a multi-tenant platform with thousands of cores and tens of terabytes of memory. Such a scale is possible in part thanks to the declarative abstraction of Kubernetes, where desired states are described in YAML manifests [5].However, YAML as a data serialization format is unfit for workload specification. Structured data in YAML are untyped and prone to wrong indents and missing fields. Due to poor meta-programming support, composing YAML with control logic---loops and branches---suffers from YAML fragmentation and indentation tracking (example at bit.ly/yml-hell). Moreover, YAML manifests are often generated by filling a shared template with cluster-specific parameters---the image tag and the replica count might differ in development and production environments. Existing templating tools---Helm [11], Kustomize [9], Kapitan [7] and the likes---assume these parameters are statically known and use CLIs to query dynamic ones, such as secrets stored in HashiCorp Vault [10]. Such scheme is hard to test, since side effects escape through CLIs, and highly depends on the execution environment, since CLI versions vary across machines or might not exist. Not least, YAML manifests describe the eventual state but not how existing workloads will be affected. Blindly applying the manifest---for example, from a stale version of code---can be disastrous and cause unexpected outages.Isopod presents an alternative configuration paradigm by treating Kubernetes objects as first-class citizens. Without intermediate YAML artifacts, Isopod renders Kubernetes objects directly in Protocol Buffers [8], so they are strongly typed and consumed directly by the Kubernetes API. With Isopod, configurations are scripted in Starlark [3], a Python dialect by Google also used by Bazel [1] and Buck [4] build systems. To replace CLI dependencies, Isopod extends Starlark with runtime built-ins to access services and utilities such as Vault, Kubernetes apiserver, Base64 encoder, and UUID generator, etc. Isopod uses a separate runtime for unit tests to mock all built-ins, providing test coverage that was not possible before.Isopod is also hermetic and secure. The common reliance on the kubeconfig file for cluster authentication leaks secrets to disk, a security risk if working from a shared host, such as a cluster node or CICD worker. Instead, Isopod builds Oauth2 tokens [6] to the target cluster using the Identity & Access Management (IAM) service of the cloud vendor. Application secrets are stored in Vault and queried at runtime. Hence, no secrets escape to the disk. In fact, Isopod prohibits disk IO except for loading Starlark modules from other scripts. No external libraries can be loaded unless explicitly implemented as an Isopod built-in. Distributed as a single binary, Isopod is self-contained with all dependencies.Finally, Isopod is extensible. Protobuf packages of Kubernetes API groups added in the future can be loaded in the same way. Because built-ins are modular and pluggable, users can easily implement and register new built-ins with the Isopod runtime to support any Kubernetes vendors. Isopod offers many other features, such as object life cycle management and parallel rollout to multiple clusters, which is impossible if using kubeconfig. In dry-run mode, Isopod displays intended actions from the current code change as a YAML diff against live objects in the cluster to avoid unexpected configuration change.Since the adoption of Isopod, the PaaS team at Cruise has migrated 14 applications and added another 16 without outage or regression, totaling around 10,000 lines of Starlark. The migration results in up to 60% reduction in code size and 80% faster rollout due to code reuse, cluster parallelism, and the removal of YAML intermediaries. All unit tests take less than 10 secs to finish. Isopod is open source at github.com/cruise-automation/isopod.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing,646

Those pursuing concurrent programming believe that activities in the real world are inherently concurrent and therefore objects are themselves active. Objects engage in shared events by sending and receiving messages. Communicating Sequential Processes [Hoar85a] and Actors [Agha86a] embrace this view. On the other hand, those pursuing models of concurrency control believe that objects are data and that concurrent access to data needs to be controlled by the system according to some correctness notion. Database transactions, atomic objects [Weih84a, Schw84a] and nested objects [Mart88a] embrace this view.Concurrent programming, in our view, places a significant burden on programming. Correct concurrent behavior is specified as combinations of interactions within a potentially large set of concurrent objects. A programmer must verify that the implementations of all the objects never produce undesirable interactions. Correctness of concurrent behavior is left to the programmer.We are pursuing models embracing concurrency control primarily because a programmer is not required to consider concurrency. The operations on an object can be specified in terms of preconditions and postconditions and traditional program verification techniques can be used to verify an operation's implementation. A programmer only considers the serial behavior of an object in isolation; he need not concern himself with how other concurrent activities might affect the object. Correctness of interleavings is left to the system.Serializability is the usual correctness notion for concurrency control algorithms. In transaction terminology, each competing transaction executes a sequence of basic actions. Any interleaving of the actions is correct if it is equivalent to some serial execution of the transaction. Serializability allows a transaction to be programmed in isolation, that is without considering possible interleavings with other transactions. The system may indeed interleave the actions of several transactions but it is up to the system to make the interleaving appear serial.Concurrent programming is apparently more general. A programmer can implement anything, including undesirable interactions like deadlock. The price for this generality is that the programmer must reason about global orderings of events and thus correctness is difficult to show.The traditional transaction model is not general enough for programming shared object systems. For example, several researchers, [Bern87a, Garc87a, Pu88a], have recognized that transactions are too restrictive for long-lived activities. The problem is that the transaction model is too conservative. Only reading and writing a data item at a single layer of abstraction is modeled. Once a read-write, write-read or write-write dependency is established between two transactions, it remains for the life of the transaction and limits further interleavings.Our approach is to discover and explore less restrictive correctness notions that still allow programmers to implement operations on objects in isolation. In [Mart88a] we present two such correctness notions: externally serializable computations and semantically verifiable nonserializable computations. Both correctness notions assume the nested object model. In [Mart87a] we give a nested object solution to the Dining Philosophers' Problem [Dijk71a]. Nested objects incorporate both the semantics of an object and the data abstraction hierarchy of an object.Nested objects form a nested object system. A nested object system is hierarchical; objects exist at different levels of the system. The execution of an operation on an object at level i results in the execution of operations on objects at level i-1. However, only top level objects are viewed externally.A computation at level i is a description of the state change made to level i objects and the return values produced by executing a partially ordered set of operations on level i objects. The computations at each level together form an n-level system computation.Externally serializable computations are n-level system computations in which the top level objects are left in states that could be produced by serial computations. However, lower level objects may be left in states that no serial computation could produce. Because both data abstraction hierarchies and operations semantics are considered in the nested object model, dependencies established between concurrent computations can be systematically ignored. Long-lived computations can execute efficiently if dependencies can later be ignored.Nested objects are more general than other models of concurrency control. Transactions are two-level nested objects that read and write basic data items. Atomic objects are two-level nested objects that perform abstract operations.The 1988 Object Based Concurrent Programming Workshop did not directly address the differences between concurrent programming and concurrency control. Perhaps future workshops can contrast the generality, the applicability, the programmability, the security and the performance implications of models from both concurrent programming and concurrency control.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 1988 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Object-Based Concurrent Programming,647

Transmission system operators need some measure of visibility into distribution system renewable generation. Distribution system generation needs to support transmission system voltage. The grid is experiencing an expansion in measurement systems. How to take full advantage of this expansion and defend against attacks, both cyber and physical, poses additional challenges. This paper introduces software designed to meet these challenges. At the center of the software is an Integrated System Model (ISM) that spans from transmission to secondary distribution. The ISM is employed in real-time abnormality detection, voltage stability forecasting, and multi-mode control. The software architecture along with selected analysis modules is presented. Testing results are presented for: 1—attacks on utility infrastructure; 2—energy savings from optimal control; 3—distribution system control response during a low voltage transmission system event; 4—cyber-attacks on PV inverters, where physical inverters are used in hardware-in-the-simulation-loop studies. Contributions of this work include real-time analysis that spans from three-phase transmission through secondary distribution; an approach for detecting abnormalities that employs measurements from three independent measurement systems; and a multi-mode distribution system control that responds to cyber-attacks, physical attacks, equipment failures, and transmission system needs. © 2023 by the authors.",Scopus,Energies,648

CPS services enable information to be exchanged between physical devices and virtual systems. The increasing malicious activities causing confidential data leakage and incorrect performance of devices are posing challenges for protection against cyber threats. Therefore, development of effective solutions that can protect both CPS data and data exchange networks are extremely urgent. This study makes some improvements on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and provides a critical analysis of the feasibility of using blockchain technology to protect constrained CPS data. It also justifies the choice of the improved PBFT for implementation on such devices and simulates the main distributed ledger scenarios. The improved PBFT works as follows: first, the client broadcasts the signed transaction data to the entire network, rather than just the master node, followed by a hash value comparison verification process; second, select the master node based on the longest chain principle, and punish the malicious node via the “blacklist” mechanism; third, add the data synchronization and verification process, as well as dynamically entering and leaving nodes via state transitions. Ultimately, the PBFT commit phase is eliminated, resulting in a two-stage process. In comparison to the original PBFT protocol, the Reinforced Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (RPBFT) protocol may substantially enhance system throughput and minimize consensus communication time, thereby improving overall system efficiency while guaranteeing security. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,Computer Communications,649

Kowalczyk and Wee proposed an adaptively secure attribute-based encryption scheme that supports NC1 circuits. However, the ciphertext length increases rapidly with the depth of the circuit, resulting in an increase of the computational complexity of the encryption and decryption algorithms. In this paper, to overcome this challenge, a ciphertext-policy ABE scheme that supports circuits with fan-in n is proposed. First, we design new pebble rules for secret sharing in circuits with fan-in n, improving the compactness of the security reduction. Then, the new secret sharing scheme is embedded in the encryption algorithm, which is the key to improving efficiency. Moreover, we prove the adaptive security of the scheme by using a piecewise guessing framework and dual-system encryption. Finally, by comparison analysis, this scheme exhibits a better performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,Journal of Supercomputing,650

When a software vulnerability becomes known, affected systems are at risk until appropriate updates become available and eventually deployed. This period can last from a few days to several months, during which attackers can develop exploits and take advantage of the vulnerability. It is tedious and time-consuming to keep track of vulnerabilities manually and perform necessary actions to shut down, update, or modify systems. Vulnerabilities affect system components, such as a web server, but sometimes only target specific versions or component combinations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automated mode switching of software systems to support system administrators in dealing with vulnerabilities and reducing the risk of exposure. We rely on model-driven techniques and use a multi-modal architecture to react to discovered vulnerabilities and provide automated contingency support. We have developed a dedicated domain-specific language to describe potential mitigation as mode switches. We have evaluated our approach with a web server case study, analyzing historical vulnerability data. Based on the vulnerabilities scores sum, we demonstrated that switching to less vulnerable modes reduced the attack surface in 98.9% of the analyzed time.

The novelty of the APS concept influenced the cyber risk paradigm and led to different considerations regarding attack objectives, techniques as well as risk management approaches. The main factor that has led to this is the autoremote operational mode, which refers to autonomous operations and remote supervision and control in case of emergency. The autoremote operational mode influences the risk of cyber attacks due to the increased connectivity and reliance on technology for automating navigational functions. On the other hand, the presence of passengers without crew members imposes a safety risk factor in cyber attacks. In this paper, we propose a new cyber risk management approach for managing the cyber risks against cyber physical systems in general and Autonomous Passenger Ships in particular. Our proposed approach aims to improve the Defense-in-Depth risk management strategy with additional components from the Threat-Informed Defense strategy allowing for more evolved cyber risk management capabilities. Moreover, we have utilized the proposed cyber risk management approach for the proposition of a cybersecurity architecture for managing the cyber risks against an APS use case named milliAmpere2. Additionally, we present our results after conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in cybersecurity evaluation in the maritime domain. Then, the findings of the SLR were utilized for a suitable evaluation of the proposed risk management approach. Our findings suggest that our proposed risk management approach named Threat-Informed Defense-in-Depth is capable of enriching several risk management activities across different stages in the system development life cycle. Additionally, a comprehensive evaluation of the cybersecurity posture of milliAmpere2 has been conducted using several approaches including risk evaluation, simulation, checklist, and adversary emulation.

Though efficient solutions now exist both for the two party, and the full threshold scenario, there is still much room for improvement, be it in terms of protocol functionality, strengthening security or further optimizing efficiency. In the past few months, a range of protocols have been published, allowing for a non interactive – and hence extremely efficient – signing protocol; providing new features, such as identifiable aborts (parties can be held accountable if they cause the protocol to fail), fairness in the honest majority setting (all parties receive output or nobody does) and other properties. In some cases, security is proven in the strong simulation based model. We combine ideas from the aforementioned articles with the suggestion of Castagnos et al. (2020) [5] to use the class group based CL framework so as to drastically reduce bandwidth consumption. Building upon this latter protocol we present a new, maliciously secure, full threshold ECDSA protocol that achieves additional features without sacrificing efficiency. Our most basic protocol boasts a non interactive signature algorithm and identifiable aborts. We also propose a more advanced variant that achieves adaptive security (for the n-out-of-n case) and proactive security.

As with cloud computing, it also faces the challenge of how to securely distribute sensitive data. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based Broadcast Encryption (CP-ABBE) can protect sensitive data and provide fine-grained access control with user revocation. However, existing CP-ABBE schemes suffer many limitations when implemented in a fog computing environment: a single authority performs poorly in handling requests or data from many IoT devices, leading to system delays or limited functionality; expensive decryption costs make the computation and storage overheads unfriendly to devices with limited resources; these schemes are only proven selectively secure, meaning that security was proven in a weaker model. In this paper, using threshold secret sharing and decryption delegation, we propose an adaptively secure attribute-based multi-authority broadcast encryption (MA-ABBE) scheme that breaks through these limitations. The comparison and analysis results show that our scheme is practical and achieves adaptive security, enables user-side fast decryption and low storage overhead, and provides a secure and efficient option for protecting sensitive data in fog computing environments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,Computer Networks,655

Next-generation computer scientists are flocking to the cutting-edge field of cloud computing for their research and exploration of uncharted territory. There are still several barriers that cloud service providers must overcome in order to provide cloud services in accordance with service level agreements. Each cloud service provider aspires to achieve maximum performance as per Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and this is especially true when it comes to the delivery of services. A cloud service level agreement (SLA) guarantees that cloud service providers will satisfy the needs of large businesses and offer their clients with a specified list of services. The authors offer a web service level agreement–inspired approach for cloud service agreements. We adopt patterns and antipatterns to symbolize the best and worst practices of OCCI (Open Cloud Computing Interface Standard), REST (Representational State Transfer), and TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) with DevOps solutions, all of which API developers should bear in mind when designing APIs. When using this method, everything pertaining to the cloud service, from creation to deployment to measurement to evaluation to management to termination, may be handled mechanically. When distributing resources to cloud apps, our system takes into account the likelihood of SLA breaches and responds by providing more resources if necessary. We say that for optimal performance, our suggested solution should be used in a private cloud computing setting. As more and more people rely on cloud computing for their day-to-day workloads, there has been a corresponding rise in the need for efficient orchestration and management strategies that foster interoperability. © 2023 International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication.

Then, radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) is used to reconstruct such abnormal actuator signal. Second, modelling issues on security path following control of AGVs with Sigmoid-like ETC scheme are shown when the AGV is suffering from abnormal actuator signal. In what follows, an ET-ASC scheme is developed to mitigate the adverse effects of abnormal actuator signal with the reconstructed abnormal signal based on a novel Sigmoid-like event-triggered communication scheme. By using the proposed RBF-NN-based ET-ASC scheme, (Figure presented.) control performance can be guaranteed under arbitrary malicious actuator signal rather than such attacks following a specific probability distribution. Final, some simulation experiments are provided to verify the effectiveness of proposed ET-ASC scheme. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Scopus,International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control,659

Even though real-world datasets usually have large intra-variations or multiple modes, most adversarial defense methods, such as adversarial training, which is currently one of the most effective defense methods, mainly focus on the single-mode setting and thus fail to capture the full data representation to defend against adversarial attacks. To confront this challenge, we propose a novel multi-prototype metric learning regularization for adversarial training which can effectively enhance the defense capability of adversarial training by preventing the latent representation of the adversarial example changing a lot from its clean one. With extensive experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, MNIST, and Tiny ImageNet, the evaluation results show the proposed method improves the performance of different state-of-the-art adversarial training methods without additional computational cost. Furthermore, besides Tiny ImageNet, in the multi-prototype CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 where we reorganize the whole datasets of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 into two and ten classes, respectively, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach by 2.22% and 1.65%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed multi-prototype method also outperforms its single-prototype version and other commonly used deep metric learning approaches as regularization for adversarial training and thus further demonstrates its effectiveness. © 2023 by the authors.",Scopus,Sensors,660

DNS over TLS, which employs TLS encryption to safeguard communication between clients and DNS recursive resolvers, suffers from performance issues that pose significant challenges. In response to these issues, the ad-TLSM has been designed to boost DNS performance by integrating a monitoring mechanism for real-time observation of the DNS recursive resolver. During the TLS handshake, crucial data, including throughput, CPU load, and the active cryptographic algorithm, are meticulously monitored and documented. This data forms the foundation for an adaptive strategy, which facilitates intelligent security adaptation during runtime, based on the prevailing conditions between the client and the server at the time of secure connection establishment. The performance evaluation of the ad-TLSM demonstrated that the DNS recursive resolver experiences excessive load while employing AES-GCM 256. However, it was found capable of managing an additional 15%-25% requests per second when ChaCha20 was implemented. These findings led to the formation of an adaptive strategy that effectively alleviates CPU load by adjusting the security level, thereby ameliorating the overall performance. In summary, the ad-TLSM surpasses existing models in latency performance and can be employed to improve performance, while satisfying quality of service constraints.

Prior to deploying these IoT applications on a large scale, a reliable service provision scheme is imperative. In recent years, network function virtualization (NFV) technologies enable fast and convenient service provision by instantiating service function chain (SFC) in the distributed cloud network. However, ensuring resilient service provision is a challenge in NFV environment due to the vulnerability of software-defined network functions. Furthermore, the sequential arrangement of virtual network functions (VNFs) in SFC exacerbates the situation, as the malfunction of any VNFs within the SFC could result in the collapse of the associated service. In this paper, we firstly built a mathematical model for SFC online reliability protection and resource consumption optimization. We then propose a multi-mode VNF backup scheme to guarantee the different reliability requirements for various services. Furthermore, a novel SFC Online Reliability Protection (SORP) scheme is introduced to handle the dynamic SFC requests in distributed cloud network.

With the rapid utilization of information and communication technologies (ICTs), smart power networks include both cyber and physical components. Considering the effects of the cyber elements is unavoidable for the accurate evaluation of system reliability. This paper aims to assess the reliability indices of the composite power systems at the substation level using the most probable configurations of the network. To cover the interdependency between the cyber and physical component's state, all possible events due to the failure of cyber elements are evaluated and a multi-state model instead of a two-state model is computed for each physical component. An algorithm is applied to select the most probable configurations of the system. In addition, the effect of utilizing the dynamic thermal rating (DTR) system, in which the rating of the system components can be improved safely, is considered in the proposed model. Finally, loss of load probability (LOLP), and expected energy not supply (EENS) as the reliability indices are calculated after evaluating the saved failure configurations applying an optimal DC load flow. The proposed approach is applied to the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) and the IEEE-24 buses as the small and large test networks respectively. The results show the efficiency of the proposed approach in determining the most probable system configurations and computing the reliability indices with high accuracy. The achieved results reveal that the most probable failure configuration of the system is the state in which the failure occurred in physical components and the cyber elements operate successfully. However, the most severe configuration occurred due to the unsuccessful operation of process buses (PBs) in substations. Furthermore, the reliability indices are improved significantly considering the DTR system instead of the static thermal rating (STR) system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,Electric Power Systems Research,663

The security establishment process depends on sharing security keys between connected devices. The level of security provided by such security protocols is static and irrelevant to the status of the network. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security-aware lottery-EDF scheduler for limited resources Ethernet packet switched networks using GAIA multi-agent approach. The proposed system adopts a periodic nonshared cryptographic key-generation process of different sizes (i.e., 64 bits, 128 bits, 160 bits, and 512 bits) using the textural features of digital images stored on a central imageserver. The proposed system deploys a security enhancement unit that adaptively enhances the confidentiality security-service level for the real-time packets according to feedback from a congestion control scheme that is based on network resource estimation technique, hence making the network robust against the spoofing security threat while preserving the overall network performance metrics (NPMs).

Probability theory and mathematical statistics are used to process and normalize the data in order to determine whether or not the system is in the correct operating mode and control process state. To describe the mode-specific control processes of a CPS, the paradigm of using cyber-physical parameters is taken as a basis, as it is the feature that most clearly reflects the system’s interaction with physical processes. In this study, two metrics were taken as a sign of an anomaly: the probability of falling into the sensor values’ confidence interval and parameter change monitoring. These two metrics, as well as the current mode evaluation, produce a final probability function for our trust in the CPS’s currently executing control process, which is, in turn, determined by the operating mode of the system. Based on the results of this trust assessment, it is possible to draw a conclusion about the processing state in which the system is operating. If the score is higher than 0.6, it means the system is in a trusted state. If the score is equal to 0.6, it means the system is in an uncertain state. If the trust score tends towards zero, then the system can be interpreted as unstable or under stress due to a system failure or deliberate attack. Through a case study using cyber-attack data for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), it was found that the method works well. When we were evaluating the normal flight mode, there were no false positive anomaly estimates. When we were evaluating the UAV’s state during an attack, a deviation and an untrusted state were detected. This method can be used to implement software solutions aimed at detecting system faults and cyber-attacks, and thus make decisions about the presence of malfunctions in the operation of a CPS, thereby minimizing the amount of knowledge and initial data about the system. © 2023 by the authors.",Scopus,Sensors,665

In this context, machine learning (ML) is increasingly employed in smart grids to solve tasks that require deep data analytics. However, it is well recognized that ML models are vulnerable to adversarial examples that might be contained in open shared data, which creates opportunities for potential attackers to launch cyberattacks. In particular, system operating states acting as critical inputs to ML-based smart grid applications (MLsgAPPs) can be manipulated by malicious actors to mislead the system operator into making wrong decisions that in turn may cause major blackouts and other damaging cascading events. It is thus imperative to advance vulnerability assessment for MLsgAPPs. In this paper, we propose a physics-constrained robustness evaluation framework for MLsgAPPs, which is a first attempt of using tree ensemble (TE) models. Unlike adversarial attacks against prior studied image-classification tasks, adversarial examples against TE-based smart grid applications (TEsgAPPs) must not only cheat human intuition but also follow laws of physics and bypass error-checking mechanisms for power systems. Thus, formulation of the traditional robustness evaluation problem must be reconsidered to account for domain-specific misclassification, physical limit, power balance, and error-bypass constraints, in order to obtain tight lower bounds of the magnitudes of tolerated adversarial perturbations. We adopt a formal modeling approach to construct a discrete tree structure and to specify the model evasion conditions. We propose an efficient robustness evaluation method by transforming variables considering ℓ1 and ℓ∞ norms, followed by a generalization that expands the variable space to admit other types of norms. Using TE-based power system security assessment as an example, comprehensive simulations are conducted for evaluating the physics-constrained robustness under different TE models and model parameters. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,Applied Energy,666

Maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) are used in combination with two filtering techniques to automatically detect regions of interest (ROI) that contain text. Proposed technique combines optical character recognition (OCR) and natural language processing (NLP) in text recognition thus taking advantage of different modalities of data. Multi-modal recognized text is then encrypted using advanced encryption standard in cipher-block chaining mode (AES-CBC) and hybrid chaotic map.

Despite these substantial advancements in recent years, cloud-based healthcare applications continue to be underutilized due to their inability to meet demanding security, privacy, and service quality standards. Amidst these advancements and their potential to collect behavioral patterns, the devices like smart fitness watches are still neglected in the healthcare system. Edge computing and federated learning (FL) have gained traction as a possible option in such situations. In this chapter, we analyze the services of edge computing and FL in medicine to evaluate the potential of intelligent processing of clinical visual data. The duo allows remote healthcare centers with limited diagnostic skills to securely benefit from multi-modal data. This study explains the motivation behind integrating FL with edge computing for IoMT and also the areas where the duo is applied for the betterment of IoMT services.

This chapter proposes a novel theoretical framework for dynamic small-signal stability assessment of power systems by estimating the region of attraction for operating states in real time. By analyzing the latest sampling data of power grids in a fixed time window, an up-to-date training set is constructed with the aid of converse Lyapunov function, which enables us to develop an online learning approach based on Gaussian Process (GP) to assess the stability level of power grids. As a result, an iteration algorithm is designed to update the assessment parameters by learning the input-output pairs in the training set. Theoretical analysis is conducted to ensure the existence of converse Lyapunov function for differential-algebraic system that serves to describe power system dynamics, as well as to estimate the region of attraction for operating states with a given confidence level. In particular, a practical method is proposed to leverage phasor measurement unit (PMU) data of real power grids for validating the online GP approach. Moreover, experimental validations are taken to substantiate the proposed online assessment approach by using PMU data of smart-grid infrastructure on EPFL campus. The proposed assessment approach contributes to situational awareness of human operators in the control station, thereby taking proactive remedial actions prior to emergencies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Scopus,"Studies in Systems, Decision and Control",673

In such a scheme, an encryptor can specify a list L⊆ N of revoked users so that (i) users in L can no longer decrypt ciphertexts, (ii) ciphertext size is independent of L, (iii) a pirate decryption box supports tracing of compromised users. The “holy grail” of this line of work is a construction which resists unbounded collusions, achieves all parameters (including public and secret key) sizes independent of |L| and |N|, and is based on polynomial hardness assumptions. In this work we make the following contributions: 1.Public Trace Setting: We provide a construction which (i) achieves optimal parameters, (ii) supports embedding identities (from an exponential space) in user secret keys, (iii) relies on polynomial hardness assumptions, namely compact functional encryption (FE ) and a key-policy attribute based encryption (ABE ) with special efficiency properties, and (iv) enjoys adaptive security with respect to the revocation list. The previous best known construction by Nishimaki, Wichs and Zhandry (Eurocrypt 2016) which achieved optimal parameters and embedded identities, relied on indistinguishability obfuscation, which is considered an inherently subexponential assumption and achieved only selective security with respect to the revocation list.2.Secret Trace Setting: We provide the first construction with optimal ciphertext, public and secret key sizes and embedded identities from any assumption outside Obfustopia. In detail, our construction relies on Lockable Obfuscation which can be constructed using LWE (Goyal, Koppula, Waters and Wichs, Zirdelis, Focs 2017) and two ABE schemes: (i) the key-policy scheme with special efficiency properties by Boneh et al. (Eurocrypt 2014) and (ii) a ciphertext-policy ABE for P which was recently constructed by Wee (Eurocrypt 2022) using a new assumption called evasive and tensor LWE. This assumption, introduced to build an ABE, is believed to be much weaker than lattice based assumptions underlying FE or iO – in particular it is required even for lattice based broadcast, without trace. Moreover, by relying on subexponential security of LWE, both our constructions can also support a super-polynomial sized revocation list, so long as it allows efficient representation and membership testing. Ours is the first work to achieve this, to the best of our knowledge. © 2023, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),676

Such topological variations can drastically change the measurement data distribution from phasor measurement units (PMUs), which may in turn compromise the accuracy of the artificial intelligence (AI)-aided monitoring and control applications using the measurements. For instance, data-driven transient stability assessment (TSA) models that were trained with static network topologies may no longer be accurate for monitoring power grid stability as the network topology changes. Not only would the number of possible topology changes be too vast to train all possible scenarios, but also the training process will render computationally intensive. This paper proposes a model-based transfer learning (TL) approach that integrates a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network (ConvLSTM), to efficiently train a new stability prediction model that predicts the system operating states (SOSs) and identify critical generators (CGs) in case of instability when the system undergoes enduring topological changes. Numerical analyses on three test cases including the IEEE 39-bus test system, the IEEE 118-bus test system, and the large-scale 2000-bus synthetic power grid in the state of Texas verify the efficiency of the proposed approach and highlight benefits in training time and accuracy, when compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;As the national power grid goes through transitions towards digitalization and modernization with emerging technologies, maintaining its reliability and resiliency against environmental stressors and cyber attacks remains an urgent need. The power system topology is expected to change more frequently, sometimes to accommodate the proliferation of heterogeneous distributed energy resources and tackle their intermittence, sometimes event-driven due to disruptive events (e.g., faults), and sometimes operator-triggered for maintenance activities and responsive control to return the system back to its normal operating condition. This article is motivated by the need for an efficient and computationally-attractive approach for online situational awareness and real-time transient stability monitoring and assessment of the power grid under an enduring topological change, where the main goal is to identify the power system operating states (SOSs) and critical generators (CGs) in case of instability. Instead of training a new model for each topological change, this paper proposes an adaptive power system transient stability assessment (TSA) method that uses transfer learning (TL) which in return reduces the training time yet with less data than a newly-trained model for each topology change scenario.

In this context, when a distributed security function is subject to a series of configuration changes, a problem that arises is the preservation of the security. The transient from the application of the first change to the last one may present unsecure temporary states, where the required security protection is missing. Establishing a safe scheduling of the configuration changes can significantly limit the number of unsecure states and decrease the time period where the network may be at risk. However, the literature challenged this problem only for centralized firewalls or SDN switches, and without applying formal methods to ensure the correctness of the computed scheduling. In order to overcome these limitations, this paper addresses the problem for distributed firewalls, aiming to satisfy the largest number of user-specified network security policies in each transient state. To this end, it proposes a formal methodology relying on the combination of three main features: automation, formal verification and optimization. This combination is achieved by pursuing a correctness-by-construction approach, based on the formulation of a Maximum Satisfiability Modulo Theories problem. A framework has been developed on the basis of this methodology, so that validation tests have been experimentally executed to assess the feasibility, efficacy and scalability of the approach. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,Computer Networks,681

For this purpose, we propose a learning automaton model capable of self-learning and adapting to changes while interacting with the external environment. Each node in the under-controlled system has a set of probable actions with respect to neighboring nodes. The same actions are represented in the graph of the learning automaton, but the probabilities of actions in the graph model are permanently updated based on the received reinforcement signals. Due to the adaptive reconfiguration of the nodes, the system is able to counteract the cyberattacks, preserving resiliency. The experimental study results for the emulated wireless sensor network (WSN) are presented and discussed. The packets loss rate stays below 20% when the number of malicious nodes is 20% of the total number of nodes, while the common system loses more than 70% of packets. The network uptime with the proposed solution is 30% longer; the legitimate nodes detect malicious nodes and rebuild their interaction with them, thereby saving their energy. The proposed mechanism allows ensuring the security and functional sustainability of the protected system regardless of its complexity and mission. © 2022 by the authors.",Scopus,Symmetry,685

First, the mobile crowd sensing is adopted for users to collect their behavior information unconsciously. Moreover, considering the interaction authentication among heterogeneous devices, we normalize sensor readings to reduce its diversity impacts. In case of multi-modal, we adopt domain adaption to transfer authentication model from single designated posture to all scenarios, thus enable the security in more realistic and complex applications.

For this reason, it is necessary to continuously improve the detection performances. With this paper, we wish to pursue this purpose with two contributions. On one hand, we aim at evaluating how improving machine learning-based malware detectors, and on the other hand, we investigate to which extent adversarial attacks can deteriorate the performances of the classifiers. Analysis of malware samples is performed using static and dynamic analysis. This paper proposes a framework for integrating both static and dynamic features trained on machine learning methods and deep neural network. On employing machine learning algorithms, we obtain an accuracy of 97.59% with static features using SVM, and 95.64% is reached with dynamic features using Random forest. Additionally, a 100% accuracy was obtained with CART and SVM using hybrid attributes (on combining relevant static and dynamic features). Further, using deep neural network models, experimental results showed an accuracy of 99.28% using static features, 94.61% using dynamic attributes, and 99.59% by combining both static and dynamic features (also known as multi-modal attributes). Besides, we evaluated the robustness of classifiers against evasion and poisoning attack. In particular comprehensive analysis was performed using permission, APIs, app components and system calls (especially n-grams of system calls). We noticed that the performances of the classifiers significantly dropped while simulating evasion attack using static features, and in some cases 100% of adversarial examples were wrongly labelled by the classification models. Additionally, we show that models trained using dynamic features are also vulnerable to attack, however they exhibit more resilience than a classifier built on static features. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,Journal of Computer Virology and Hacking Techniques,689

We proposed a concept of the vulnerability of bike-sharing system and a method to measure it. The method depends on the cost changes due to additional travel time induced by the failure of bike docking stations. It can capture the traffic mode transfer in the context of multi-modal traffic system, such as walking, bus, and subway. Moreover, to investigate the impact of network structure on the vulnerability, we developed the centrality measuring methods, and a community detection model for the bike-sharing system. Subsequently, the proposed methods are applied to Citi Bike in New York City, the largest bike-sharing system in the USA. The results show that the most vulnerable bike docking stations are located far from bus and railway stations, with low docking station density in their surrounding areas. We also found that the number of nearby bicycle stations, bus stops, and subway stations have a negative correlation with the vulnerability index. In contrast, the degree centrality and trip betweenness centrality are positively associated with the index. The proposed vulnerability analysis method can help urban planners to evaluate the design of a bike-sharing system and buttress operators to optimize maintenance planning. © 2022",Scopus,Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice,690

This paper considers the UAV relay anti-jamming communication issue under the threat of a malicious jammer with beam-forming jamming capability. To prevent the relay link from deteriorating, UAV trajectory adjustment and transmission mode switching between half-duplex and full-duplex are two available schemes, while they will incur the additional flying costs and continuous mode switching, respectively. To balance the trade-off between trajectory optimization and mode selection, this paper investigates the joint trajectory optimization and mode selection anti-jamming approach. First, an anti-jamming utility considering the cost-efficient and end-to-end capacity gains is designed. Second, to model the bounded rationality of both the UAV relay and the jammer due to the adversarial context, a biased Stackelberg game to analyse the competitive system interactions is proposed. Moreover, the existence of Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) in the problem is proved. Finally, a joint mode selection and trajectory optimization (JMSTO) algorithm based on the multi-armed bandit is proposed to obtain the SE. It is further demonstrated that the JMSTO algorithm has a logarithmic regret. The results show that our proposed JMSTO algorithm is superior to non-joint optimization methods. © 2022 The Authors.

Blockchain network architecture is a promising technology for constructing highly secure Internet of Things (IoT) networks. IoT networks typically comprise various sensors and actuators. Blockchain network technology can be applied to secure control robots in smart factories or reliable drone deliveries in smart cities. The wide spread of transactions and shared smart contracts across blockchain networks guarantees ultimate network security. A typical wired blockchain network maintains sufficient redundancy within a stable configuration. However, IoT blockchain networks exhibit unavoidable instability. The dynamic configuration changes caused by flexible node membership make it impossible to achieve the same level of redundancy as a stable network. A trustworthy transaction spreading method provides practical transaction sharing for dynamic IoT networks. We propose a Q-learning framework and a graph convergence network (GCN) to search for the proper spreading path of each transaction. The proposed Q-learning framework determines the next spreading hop using node features. The GCN determines the reliable area based on the Q-learning results. The discovered reliable area guides the proper spreading path of transactions to the destination node.

Our strategy does not require any modifications to the DNS architecture. Through an extensive experimental campaign, the prototype system is proved to be effective against multiple attack modes. Its success rate is 98.5% approximately, and network round-trip time is about 55 ms. Even for random attackers, our method can achieve the theoretical maximum defensive success rate. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Scopus,International Journal of Intelligent Systems,696

In parallel, the research communities are collaborating to lower the entry barriers for space activities to deliver more innovative and cost-effective space missions. This evolution has been termed as New Space. However, this transformation of the space ecosystem has led to changes in the threat landscape, introducing new threat vectors and threat actors intent on compromising space systems and missions. As a result, it is expected that cyber threats could increase against space systems. Furthermore, teleoperation, a significant use case for building extraterrestrial habitats, has already been shown vulnerable in other domains as well. For example, teleoperated robots developed for remote surgery have been shown to be vulnerable to threats, such as malicious control due to an elevation-of-privilege attack. Threat modelling is a systematic and structured method to determine associated system vulnerabilities, possible attack entry points and vectors, and potential impacts on the system. In this work, we examine the efficacy of the de facto threat modelling methods such as STRIDE/DREAD in capturing highly adaptive security requirements and threats from a system-centric perspective for the teleoperation mission scenario. Understanding and protecting these hardware-software assets and their interaction in the mission is of foremost importance since security breaches threaten human safety across the broader New Space ecosystem. This research presents the limitations of existing threat modelling approaches in capturing hardware-software interaction in space systems, which is an open area for scientific enquiry. Moreover, research challenges are raised to improve the safety and security of the teleoperation mission. The output of this work can then be used to develop more appropriate threat modelling approaches to support security requirement engineering for different New Space mission scenarios. © 2022",Scopus,Advances in Space Research,697

Based on this policy, the Regularity-based Resource Partitioning (RRP) model defines an efficient interface specification to hierarchically partition and assign resource slices among VMs. Although this model has received plenty of attention recently, three major pieces remain missing for applying this model in ERTVS. (1) Embedded systems are more sensitive to resource utilization efficiency since this may drastically affect their deployment cost for including additional cores. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal and an approximate RRP resource scheduler for multi-core platforms. (2) A resource reconfiguration is required when an embedded system has to switch between operating modes, resulting in the current cyclic schedule being replaced by another pre-configured and verified cyclic schedule. This paper formalizes a new One-Hop Reconfiguration (OHR) problem tailored for mode-switch-capable embedded systems and introduces a corresponding optimal solution.

The Blockchain is a widely utilized decentralization technology that is implemented in various industries. Therefore, this technology can be used to protect sensitive services, such as those associated with the configuration changing of information systems. This article proposes a new protocol operating as a decentralization layer over any configuration scheme. It uses smart contracts—programs existing on the Blockchain—to keep track of configuration proposals and authorize new configurations. The configuration change can be proposed at any time. However, only once it is authorized by appropriate parties can it be introduced to the system. The new protocol provides an additional security layer, ensuring that every action is accounted for and authenticated. Furthermore, it enforces that administrators authorize every change. The protocol was designed to be flexible and easily adaptable to scenarios that did not use distributed ledger technology before. It uses the HTTP protocol with the JSON standard for protocol messages to allow easier adoption and transparency. The features of the proposed protocol were analyzed from a security point of view as well as from the financial perspective related to costs of using Blockchain technology. Security analysis shows that the protocol is resilient to the most common security risks that haunt state-of-the-art IT systems. Additionally, the authors proved that this solution could be implemented in both private and public Blockchains. A reference implementation was shared in a public repository.

The existing solutions treat security as an aggregated quality by enforcing “one service for all” without considering the explicit security requirements of each asset or the costs associated with security. Dealing with the security of assets in ultra-large environments calls for rethinking the way we select and compose services—considering not only the services but the underlying supporting computational resources in the process. We motivate the need for an asset-centric, self-adaptive security framework that selects and allocates services and underlying resources in the cloud. The solution leverages learning algorithms and market-inspired approaches to dynamically manage changes in the runtime security goals/requirements of assets with the provision of suitable services and resources, while catering for monetary and computational constraints. The proposed framework aims to inform the self-adaptive security efforts of security researchers and practitioners operating in dynamic large-scale environments, such as the Cloud.

IIoT establishes an enterprise-to-enterprise setup that means industries have several factories and manufacturing units that are dependent on other sectors for their services and products. In this context, individual industries need to share their information with other external sectors in a shared environment which may not be secure. The capability to examine and inspect such large-scale information and perform analytical protection over the large volumes of personal and organizational information demands authentication and confidentiality so that the total data are not endangered after illegal access by hackers and other unauthorized persons. In parallel, these large volumes of confidential industrial data need to be processed within reasonable time for effective deliverables. Currently, there are many mathematical-based symmetric and asymmetric key cryptographic approaches and identity- and attribute-based public key cryptographic approaches that exist to address the abovementioned concerns and limitations such as computational overheads and taking more time for crucial generation as part of the encipherment and decipherment process for large-scale data privacy and security. In addition, the required key for the encipherment and decipherment process may be generated by a third party which may be compromised and lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, brute force attacks, etc. In parallel, there are some other quantum key distribution approaches available to produce keys for the encipherment and decipherment process without the need for a third party. However, there are still some attacks such as photon number splitting attacks and faked state attacks that may be possible with these existing QKD approaches. The primary motivation of our work is to address and avoid such abovementioned existing problems with better and optimal computational overhead for key generation, encipherment, and the decipherment process compared to the existing conventional models. To overcome the existing problems, we proposed a novel dynamic quantum key distribution (QKD) algorithm for critical public infrastructure, which will secure all cyber–physical systems as part of IIoT. In this paper, we used novel multi-state qubit representation to support enhanced dynamic, chaotic quantum key generation with high efficiency and low computational overhead. Our proposed QKD algorithm can create a chaotic set of qubits that act as a part of session-wise dynamic keys used to encipher the IIoT-based large scales of information for secure communication and distribution of sensitive information. © 2022 by the authors.",Scopus,Sensors,703

The objective of low latency detection is to minimize detection delay while ensuring high detection accuracy. This is different from conventional detection methods that focus mainly on detection accuracy and pay little attention to detection delay. A lower detection delay can reduce recovery time, thus minimizing service interruption or economic losses due to cyberattacks. Since detection delay is the main design metric, the algorithm is developed by using a non-linear dynamic AC system model with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to capture power grid state transitions in real-time, while many other works in the literature use a simplified linear DC model. The DRL detection algorithm is developed by using a continuous state space deep Q-network (DQN) on the framework of a Markov decision process (MDP). The new DQN design has two main innovations. First, the MDP state is designed as a sliding window of Rao-statistics of the AC dynamic state estimation residues. The proposed state formulation can accurately capture dynamic power state transitions in real-time. Second, a new reward function is designed to allow a flexible trade-off between detection delays and detection accuracy. The delay-accuracy trade-off can be adjusted by tuning a single parameter in the reward function. Simulation results show that the proposed DQN-based DRL detection algorithm can achieve very low detection delays with high detection accuracy. © 2022",Scopus,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,704

However, with the benefits come risks that have been overlooked, and robotic arms have become a heavily attacked area. In order to improve the security of the robotic arm system, this paper proposes an intrusion detection method based on a state classification model. The closure operation process of the robotic arm is divided into five consecutive states, while a support vector machine based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-H-SVM) classifies the operation state of the robotic arm. In the detection process, the classifier predicts the operation state of the robotic arm in real time, and the detection method determines whether the state transfer meets the logical requirements, and then determines whether the intrusion occurs. In addition, a response mechanism is proposed on the basis of the intrusion detection system to make protection measures for the robotic arm system. Finally, a physical experiment platform was built to test the intrusion detection method.

Although the previous Olympic Games have a long history of using surveillance technologies, there are perennial challenges in terms of false alarms, energy consumption, and labor and capital costs. In this paper, an IoT-based multi-agent intelligent border surveillance method with less cost is proposed. Following a two-level autonomous mechanism, the method assures agent-level self-patrolling by distributed nodes and system-level multi-agent surveillance task coordination by the central server. The core entity of each distributed node is the IoT-based SmartGM, an autonomous surveillance tower integrating multi-modal surveillance devices. Finally, based on intelligent visual reasoning algorithms, the proposed activation strategy updates surveillance devices’ activation status simultaneously according to global states, ensuring long-term operation.

The interdependence of these spaces makes that CPSS is more likely to be attacked. The attack consequences may directly affect the state of the physical world and even endanger the people's life. Thus, the most challenging issue for CPSS is to ensure the space security. However, existing security analysis methods focus on the static analysis at the design phase. They do not consider the open and dynamic characteristics which are the core features of CPSS. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security analysis framework for CPSS to prevent the unauthorized flow of information. Firstly, the access control model of CPSS is proposed. It controls the access behaviors by considering the space information covering the social, cyber, and physical spaces. Secondly, Labelled Transition System (LTS) is established to describe the future evolutions of CPSS. The space states in the LTS which violate the security requirements are reasoned by the model checking technology. Thirdly, a policy adjustment method is proposed to prevent the system from entering the violated states or mitigate the bad results caused by the violations. In the end, the effectiveness of our approach is evaluated by a smart building case, and the necessity of our approach is analyzed by the performance evaluation. © 2021",Scopus,Computers and Security,710

The combinatorial models used to predict reliability using architectures such as fault trees, binary decision diagrams, etc. have limitations in modeling complex system behavior. On the other hand, state-based models such as Markov chains suffer from the state-space explosion problem, and they need transition probability among different system states to measure reliability. These probabilities are usually assumed or are obtained from the operational profile for which the system should be used in the field. Objective: The objective of this paper is to present a method for predicting the reliability of software in industrial systems using a generalized stochastic Petri nets based approach. The key idea is to violate the assumption of state transition probabilities in the Markov chain. The state transition probabilities are calculated using Petri net transitions’ throughput by performing stationary analysis under the consideration to identify and handle dead markings in the Petri net. Method: Initially, a generalized stochastic Petri net of the system under consideration is generated from the standard system's specification. Thereafter, dead markings are identified in the Petri net which are further removed to perform steady-state analysis. At last, a Markov model is generated based on the reachability graph of the Petri net, which is further used to predict the system reliability. Results: The presented method has been applied to a safety-critical system, Shut Down System-1, of a nuclear power plant, which is operational in the Canada Deuterium Uranium reactor. The predicted reliability of the system using this method is 99.99966% which has been validated using the specified system requirements. To further validate and generalize the results, sensitivity analysis is performed by varying different system parameters. Conclusions: The method discussed in this paper presents a step of performing structural analysis on the Petri net of the system under consideration to identify and handle dead markings on the Petri net. It further handles the issue of assuming transition probabilities among the system states by calculating them using Petri net transitions’ throughput. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,Information and Software Technology,712

Cyberspace security has had a tremendous impact on numerous crucial infrastructures. Along with current security status data, historical data should be acquired by the system to implement the latest cyber security defense and protection. It also makes intelligent decisions that can provide adaptive security management and control. An intelligent cyber security framework using Hyperparameter Tuning based on Regularized Long Short-Term Memory (HT-RLSTM) technique was developed in this work to elevate the security level of core system assets. To detect various attacks, the proposed framework was trained and tested on the collection of data. Owing to missing values, poor scaling, imbalanced and overlapped data, the data was primarily incomplete and inconsistent. To elevate the decision making for detecting attacks, the inconsistent or unstructured data issue was addressed. The missing values were handled by this work along with scaling performance using the developed Kernelized Robust Scaler (KRS). Using the developed Random Over Sample-Based Density-Based Spatial Clustering Associated with Noise (ROS-DBSCAN), the imbalanced and overlapped data were handled, which was followed by the relevant feature selection of data utilizing the Sine Cosine-Based Artificial Jellyfish Search Optimization (SC-AJSO) technique. The data were split under the provision of Stratified K-Fold cross-validation along being trained in the proposed HT-RLSTM. The experimental analysis depicted that better accuracy was attained in detecting attacks by the proposed work for different datasets. When analogized with prevailing state-of-the-art methods, a low false detection rate, as well as computation time, was attained by the proposed scheme. © 2022 by the authors.

As applied widely in engineering fields, protective devices are commonly equipped for the systems operating in shock environment to reduce external damage, which has not been taken into consideration in existing literatures. This paper investigates the reliability of multi-state systems with competing failure patterns supported by a protective device. According to the system failure modes, state-based and shock number-based triggering mechanism of the protective device are developed. That is, the protective device is triggered once the system state or cumulative number of shocks exceeds corresponding critical thresholds respectively. After being triggered, the protective device can reduce the probability of damaging shocks for the system. The protective device fails when the number of consecutive valid shocks reaches a threshold. Based on the constructed model, a finite Markov chain imbedding approach is employed to derive reliability indices including distribution functions of system lifetime and residual lifetime, together with expected operating time of the protective device. Moreover, two age-based replacement policies together with a condition-based replacement policy are developed to accommodate different maintenance scenarios and corresponding optimal solutions are acquired.

The existing multimedia in IoT multimedia security solutions are insufficient for detecting such complex attacks and require a self-adaptive security mechanism that can monitor the changing environment and detect, mitigate, plan, and prevent future prospective attacks in real time.

Our scheme does not rely on NIZKs, and we prove that our scheme is semi-adaptively unforgeable in the standard model; that is, the adversary can announce the challenge attribute after seeing the public parameters but before launching any query. Unlike our scheme, previous approaches either construct selectively unforgeable ABS schemes in the standard model that only support attributes of a-priori bounded polynomial length, or construct adaptively unforgeable ABS schemes that support attributes of unbounded polynomial length but relying on NIZKs. We adapt an existing technique developed by Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan for constructing lattice-based semi-adaptively secure (key-policy) attribute-based encryption (ABE) with unbounded attribute length. In particular, we use the adapted technique to generate an unbounded number of matrices out of a-priori bounded public matrices in the construction and program the challenge attribute into the public matrices in our semi-adaptive security proof. Moreover, to achieve adaptive signature query in our semi-adaptive security proof, we employ the traditional partitioning technique developed in identity-based systems to encode the message to be signed. Re-using and adapting lattice-based ABE technique and partitioning technique for lattice-based ABS should not be surprising since the three settings share many features, especially their security proof ideas. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,"Designs, Codes, and Cryptography",719

As the information and communication systems play a more important role in the infrastructure of the power system, a cyber-attack on them may have an impact on the power system and cause a serious threat to the integrated energy system. To analyze the threat to the complex and integrated system, some researchers provide some modeling methods to study the impact of cyber-attacks on the information and communication systems, such as the Attack Tree Model, Attack Graph Model, Petri Net Model for cyber-attack, Attack Description Language Model, State Transition Graph Model, etc. However, these modeling methods have some shortcomings. For example, they cannot describe the systematical cyber-attack and show the secure status during the cyber-attack; it is hard for them to analyze the larger and more complicated information and communication systems. To overcome the shortages, in this paper, a correlated matrix-based object-oriented model is proposed for cyber-attack modeling. With this model, the relationship between the attacker and victim can be directly built; the cyber-attack path and packets from the attacker can be tracked; and the status of the nodes and links can be shown during a cyber-attack. There are two steps to build the cyber-attack model. Firstly, the procedure and approach of the cyber-attack will be modeled by an object-oriented method; then, a correlated matrix model will be built for network topology, attack path, and attack procedure. By combining these two models, the whole cyber-attack model is created. Finally, to demonstrate the modeling method and its benefits, we use the MITM (Man-in-the-middle Attack) attack on measurement data of an AVC (Automation Voltage Control) system as examples, and build a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) co-simulation platform to verify the model.

The framework would utilize the MAPE‐BBC adaptation loop to make decisions internally based on the threat models, goal models, and service level agreement (SLA) SC security specifications. The framework identifies vulnerabilities and threats and takes precautionary measures using self‐adaptive SC agents. We validated the proposed methodology theoretically and empirically, and statistically proved the research questions and hypothesis using the t‐test and Mann–Whitney U test. Subsequently, we compare our proposed approach with the Security Quality Requirements Engineering approach (SQUARE). The feasibility results and the replicated study results indicate that the proposed approach outperformed the SQUARE approach in terms of artifacts quality, self‐adaptive security evaluation quality, efficiency in response time, complexity, and usefulness of the proposed approach for the Healthcare Data Management (HDM) system. SC security developers can immensely benefit from our proposed methodology. They need not reengineer SC from scratch; depending on their security needs and plan, the contract can be adapted to execute a new plan. © 2022 by the authors.

The communication connection in NCS allows agents to communicate with each other quickly, which can quickly respond to abrupt changes in the system. NCS depend on computers and multi-purpose networks for operation, rendering them vulnerable to attacks, especially cyber attacks. This paper focuses on time delay switch (TDS) attacks. A method based on Lyapunov theory is proposed to detect and estimate TDS attack in real time, so as to detect the unstable impact of TDS attack and recover from it.

However, there is a lack of a comprehensive assessment framework that can holistically validate their effectiveness. Existing Adaptive S&P assessment efforts either focus on privacy or security in general, or are focused on specific adaptive S&P attributes, e.g. authentication, and, at certain times, disregards the architecture in which they should be comprehended. In this paper, we propose a holistic assessment framework for evaluating adaptive S&P solutions for IoT e-health. The framework utilizes a proposed classification of essential attributes necessary to be recognized, evaluated, and incorporated for the effectiveness of adaptive S&P solutions for the most common IoT architectures, fog-based and cloud/server-based architectures. As opposed to the existing related work, the classification comprehensively covers all the major classes of essential attributes, such as S&P objectives, contextual factors, adaptation action aptitude, and the system’s self-* properties. Using this classification, the framework assists to evaluate the existence of a given attribute with respect to the adaptation process and in the context of the architectural layers. Therefore, it stresses the importance of where an essential attribute should be realized in the adaptation phases and in the architecture for an adaptive S&P solution to be effective. We have also presented a comparison of the proposed assessment framework with existing related frameworks and have shown that it exhibits substantial completeness over the existing works to assess the feasibility of a given adaptive S&P solution. © 2022,International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

Currently, most of them base their approach on the signature, and it does not allow users to defend themselves from current threats.

However, during the UAV swarm combat, the UAV network will be interfered by the enemy, which will damage some key UAV nodes or communication links and affect the connectivity of the entire network, thus leading to the fact that the entire network becomes more vulnerable. Therefore, it is necessary to study the network vulnerability of UAV networks in interference scenarios. In this paper, a coupled map lattice (CML) model which is a dynamic system with discrete time, discrete space, and continuous state variables is proposed to assess the vulnerability of UAV networks. The CML model integrates multiple topological indicators such as node degree, node betweenness, and node clustering coefficient, and reflects the node state change of the UAV network in the interference scenario from the topological point of view. When changing the strategy of interfering UAV nodes in different interfering scenarios, the relative network efficiency and failure proportion are used as indicators to study the change of network vulnerability. The studies show that precisely interfering important UAV nodes in a network can cause more damage to the UAV network. We also discover that as the intensity of external interference increases, the entire network will become increasingly vulnerable and the vulnerability of the network will also have different manifestations under different interfering strategies.  © 2022 Xiaoyu Xie et al.",Scopus,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,727

The study models two and four states of exploration and exploitation based on their cybersecurity responses over time and uses a continuous-time Markov chain approach to analyze transitions between states as organizations adapt their responses over time to achieve ambidexterity. The two-state Markov model focuses on the firm-level Exploration and Exploitation states whereas the four-state model captures deeper levels of exploration and exploitation by considering Surviving, Investigating, Reinforcing, and Balancing as possible states for exploration and exploitation of cybersecurity responses.

In such environments, there is always risk of data breach through unauthorized interceptions. This may lead to unauthorized access to tactical information and infiltration into the systems. In this work, we propose a detailed training setup in the federated learning framework for object classification where the raw data will be maintained locally at the edge devices and will not be shared with a central server or with each other. The server sends a global model to edge devices, which is then trained locally at the edge, and the updated parameters are sent back to the central server, where they are aggregated, which takes place iteratively. This setup ensures robustness against malicious cyberattacks as well as reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, to tackle the irregularity in object classification task with a single data modality in such contested environment, a deep learning model incorporating multiple modalities is used as the global model in our proposed federated learning setup. This model can serve as a possible solution in object identification with multi-modal data.

We develop a monitor that uses an abstract digital twin, Tiny Twin, to detect false sensor data and faulty control commands. The Tiny Twin is a state transition system that represents the observable behavior of the system from the monitor point of view. At runtime, the monitor observes the sensor data and the control commands, and checks whether the observed data and commands are consistent with the state transitions in the Tiny Twin. The monitor produces an alarm when an inconsistency is detected. We model the components of the system and the physical processes in the Rebeca modeling language and use its model checker to generate the state space. The Tiny Twin is built automatically by reducing the state space, keeping the observable behavior of the system, and preserving the trace equivalence.

However, the security threats it faces are becoming more and more diverse, and the security needs are becoming more and more urgent. However, wireless sensor network nodes are mutually exclusive, which leads to low accuracy of attack path prediction when malicious attacks occur. In order to ensure the security of wireless sensor networks, a hidden Markov based malicious attack path prediction method for wireless sensor networks is designed. The method of authentication coding is introduced to realize data integrity authentication. Extract the malicious software gene sequence, define the constraint conditions of the state transition probability matrix, build the attack means deduction model based on Hidden Markov, and realize the malicious attack path prediction. Experimental results: the average accuracy of the proposed method in four malicious attack scenarios is 73.583%, 55.674%, 32.923% and 85.014%, respectively. The results also verify that the proposed method improves the accuracy of malicious attack path prediction in wireless sensor networks based on Hidden Markov model, and has good feasibility.

This RPA is targeted for automating rule-based repetitive and high-volume tasks with higher accuracy which eventually reduces the operation cost and processing time. The cognitive automation which is being developed as part of enterprise computing automation best utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enhance the process model of RPA in terms of improved accuracy, reliability, and consistency in taking intelligent business decisions with no or minimal human interventions. The majority of the communications between computing nodes and bots are being provisioned through service-oriented enterprise computing interfaces, which are built based on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).

Specifically, cyber security issues are analyzed when using information technology workstations to manage modern safety instruments that are critical components of safety instrumented systems. Attack paths and security controls in real-world industrial control safety system architectures typically used in the oil and gas sector are examined to determine whether a safety-instrumented-system-mediated architecture could provide better protection against unauthorized and malicious safety instrument configuration changes than a multiplexer-mediated architecture. The determination leveraged crafted assessment questions that were answered using standard cyber security assessment methods. The research reveals that recurring vulnerabilities exist in all safety systems due to design issues in safety instruments, the Highway Addressable Remote Transducer protocol, third-party device management software and safety instrument management solutions. Additionally, device-native hardware write protection provides the best defense followed by safety instrumented system write protection. When using safety instrumented system security controls, a safety-instrumented-system-mediated architecture can protect against unauthorized device reconfigurations better than a multiplexer-mediated architecture.

The web service is the implementation technology of service oriented architecture (SOA) where it is built on the existing networking and web interfacing standards as it has to use the web as a medium of communication and does not have any specialized in-built layer for security. The majority of the vendor security products in the market need specialized hardware/software components, eventually, they break the standards and principles of service oriented architecture. The traditional way of problem solving is not effective for developing security solutions for service oriented computing, as its boundaries keep expanding beyond a single organiza-tional environment due to the advent of communication and business technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), hyper-personalization, and edge computing. Hence, it is a mandatory entity in this digital age of enterprise computing to have a specialized authentication and authorization solution exclusively for addressing the existing security gaps in SOA in an adaptive way forward approach. In this paper, the security gaps in the existing Identity and Access Management (IDAM) solutions for service oriented enterprise computing are analyzed, and a novel intelligent security engine which is packed with extended authentication and authorization solution model for service consumption is presented. The authentication and authorization security requirements are considered as cross cutting concerns of SOA implementation and the solution is constructed as Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) advices, which enables the solution can be attached as a ‘plug & play’ component without changing the underlying source code of the service implementation. For Proof-of-Concept (PoC), the proposed authentication and authorization security model is tested in a large scale service oriented enterprise computing environment and the results have been analyzed statistically. It is evident from the results that the proposed security model addresses security issues comparatively better than existing security solutions. © 2022 University of Kuwait.

One of the major advantages of SDN over Traditional Networks is centralized control over the network. In Traditional Networks, no separate Control Layer is present, due to which configuration and management of the network become extremely difficult. SDN introduces a separate Control Layer, which makes network management an easy and reliable process. Network management is now flexible and does not require expensive hardware and configuration changes. From this, not only the network administrator but also the network intruder benefits. SDN separates the Control and Data Plane of the Network. Due to the separation of the Control Plane, DoS/DDoS attacks on SDN Controller can cause a Single Point of Failure of the entire network, and hence security becomes vital for SDN. In this paper, the security challenges of all three layers of SDN, and solutions that need to be taken by the network administrator has been discussed. Various key benefits of SDN Security has been discussed in this paper.

Through the investigation of network security managers, this article uses structured modeling technology to derive the system's logical business functions, which are data acquisition function, data analysis function, and post-processing function. This study uses a three-tier architecture to design the system, describes the system data business processing flow, and gives the key flow of the K-means algorithm application. In addition, the system database is designed to provide support for system data processing. This study proposes a dual-network text matching model based on local interactive components. This model composes two modalities of single-modal short text data: a positional structural modal for describing local interactions and a global semantic understanding modal for extracting global semantic information. Two heterogeneous networks are used to extract two modalities. The principle of complementarity of modalities is realized by constructing the differences of each modal. At the same time, through the attention mechanism, the position information of the position structure modal is transferred to the global semantic understanding modal to obtain consistent comprehensive information so as to realize the principle of modal consistency. On this basis, by designing low-order interaction functions and high-order interaction functions, and using long- and short-term memory networks, we have, respectively, improved the position structure modal and global semantic understanding modal. The theoretical analysis and simulation results of the model show that the propagation characteristics of the network worm are completely determined by the threshold R0 required for its existence. When R0 >1, the network worm will become popular even with a small initial infection number; conversely, even if the initial infection machine is large, the network worm will eventually become extinct. The research results of this article also show that the introduction of mobile devices has an important impact on the defense technology of network worms. To curb network worms that use both the network and mobile devices to spread, and to increase the proportion of machines that have never been infected with the virus, the most effective method is to control the number of mobile devices and reduce the possibility of cross-infection between mobile devices and machines. The simulation results show that, regardless of whether dynamic isolation and antivirus software are considered, the local area network-based choke method given in this study can effectively curb intelligent network worms that have slow scanning rates and clear scanning targets. In addition, the choke method presented in this article can determine the choke threshold without affecting the normal network scanning behavior of users in the local area network.  © 2022 Jinhuan Hou and Fuqiang Ding.",Scopus,Scientific Programming,756

Thus, risk mitigation requires a dynamic risk assessment process, coupled with an adaptive, event driven security enforcement mechanism, to efficiently deal with dynamically evolving risks in a cost efficient manner. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security framework that covers both situational risk assessment and situational driven security policy deployment. We extend MITIGATE, a maritime-specific risk assessment methodology, to capture situations in the risk assessment process and thus produce fine-grained and situation-specific, dynamic risk estimations. Then, we integrate DynSMAUG, a situation-driven security management system, to enforce adaptive security policies that dynamically implement security controls specific to each situation. To validate the proposed framework, we test it based on maritime cargo transfer service. We utilize various maritime specific and generic systems employed during cargo transfer, to produce dynamic risks for various situations. Our results show that the proposed framework can effectively assess dynamic risks per situation and automate the enforcement of adaptive security controls per situation. This is an important improvement in contrast to static and situation-agnostic risk assessment frameworks, where security controls always default to worst-case risks, with a consequent impact on the cost and the applicability of proper security controls. © 2021 by the authors.

This poses challenges for the bidirectional synchronisation of the discrete cyber models and the partially continuous physical systems. Threats to CPS from cyber attacks are, however, often instantiable only where conditions on the CPS state during the attack meet certain conditions such that they drive the system state outside a desirable or safe space. In this paper we propose an extension to an applied π-calculus in which we can capture both the behaviour of the CPS as well as modelling possible adversary behaviour. This is achieved by embedding an algebraic representation of Attack–Defence Trees (ADT) in the applied π-calculus and augmenting this by the addition of a partial ordering over the constituents of the ADT within the embedding, offering an elegant mechanism to extend ADT to ordering and time-related attacks.

Finally, numerical analyses illustrate the influence of the IDS parameters on the optimal infection probability of malware and reveal the effect of multiple factors on the steady-state availability of HSNs, including the initial infection rate, the infection change rate, and the malware attack correlation. In addition, we present data analyses of the steady-state availability of HECWSNs with various topologies, including the star topology, cluster topology, and mesh topology, which provide a theoretical basis for the design, deployment, and maintenance of high-availability HECWSNs.  © 2022 Hong Zhang et al.",Scopus,Mobile Information Systems,760

By taking the impact of rescheduling under contingencies into consideration, reliability-constrained unit commitment (RCUC) is developed to address this challenge. Although several efforts have been made in modelling reliability constraints, the existing methods can only manage oversimplified low-order temporal-independent contingencies without considering wide-range contingencies or their state-transition-process issue. To quantify the impact of rescheduling on the normal-state scheduling process denoted by UC problem, this paper builds up a Bayesian inference method for encoding reliability constraints in wide-range temporal-dependent contingencies. Three predictors, for example, expected-generator-rescheduling-power, expected-energy-not-serviced and lost-of-load-probability, are selected to describe the possible corrective behaviours in rescheduling process and quantified by using Bayesian inference method. Then, these predictors are reformatted as a set of linearized constraints to be incorporated into UC. The proposed RCUC comprehensively considers the effect of rescheduling in wide-range temporal-dependent contingencies. Therefore, it can reveal the influence of generator rescheduling in wide-range contingencies and keep better reliability performance than those methods reported in previous RCUC studies. The modified IEEE 30-bus test system and IEEE 118-bus test system are used to show the proposed model's effectiveness. © 2021 The Authors.

Various quantum information protocols with diverse functionalities have been proposed and implemented. However, in general, the present quantum information system can only carry out a single information protocol or deal with a single communication task, which limits its practical application in the future. Therefore, it is essential to develop a multifunctional platform compatible with multiple different quantum information protocols. In this Letter, by utilizing an all-optical platform consisting of a gain-tunable parametric amplifier, a beam splitter, and an entanglement source, we experimentally realize the partially disembodied quantum state transfer protocol, which links the all-optical quantum teleportation protocol and the optimal 1→N coherent state cloning protocol. As a result, these three protocols, which have different physical essences and functionalities, are implemented in a single all-optical machine. In particular, we demonstrate that the partially disembodied quantum state transfer protocol can enhance the state transfer fidelity compared with all-optical quantum teleportation under the same strength of entanglement.

This tremendous growth will be certainly accompanied by a wider and fast-evolving security threat landscape, especially when the potential of massive devices connectivity will be fully unleashed. In this paper, we outline the security challenges faced by the 5G radio access network (5G-RAN) control plane as a result of the functional and architectural enhancements made at the radio resource control (RRC) protocol layer. We correspondingly analyze the dynamics of the new 5G RRC three-states model for a machine-type traffic pattern under an attack-free situation. Afterwards, we introduce and describe two RRC-based denial of service (DoS) attacks threatening the 5G-RAN resources availability. In the first threat scenario, the attacker maliciously manipulates the timing of state transitions in an attempt to overload the control plane. The second attack can be carried out through faking huge on-demand system information requests to prevent legitimate consumers from access to the cell and cause failed and interrupted 5G mobile services. Through numerical simulations, we measure the potential impact of these attacks on both 5G devices using the collision probability along with the access delay metrics, and on the critical gNB-centralized unit using the signaling overhead and the resource occupancy time metrics. Our observations reveal that both attacks can have disastrous effects on network stability and resiliency. Finally, some promising solutions are listed, with a special emphasis on injecting randomness into system parameters to complicate the task of designing such DoS attacks. © 2021",Scopus,Journal of Information Security and Applications,766

Currently, Apps provide label that contains a combination of developer info, memory size, category, operating system compatibility, user ratings and reviews, and privacy policy. However, the product label information is asymmetrical and it varies with the developer. It is challenging to develop common standards explicit to users, as their needs are dynamic; moreover, the App undergoes a series of state changes during execution, according to the usage pattern.

The experimental results in quantifying a real time traffic data of an internet based App validated the proposed label by revealing the key features to the users; moreover, PCA carried out on four sets of traffic data enabled the selection of prominent data, and the results also revealed the possible embedding of the framework within an App for dynamic monitoring. © 2021 University of Kuwait.

Switching between working component and standby component is a feasible way to balance component degradation and extend system lifetime. Motivated by these results, we propose a joint optimization model that captures both component switching and mission abort policies for multistate warm standby systems.

When the security issue is considered, establishing a secure multi-hop path in AHWNs is challenging because an intermediate node having a wireless link with previous nodes may not be secure to receive data from those nodes, and vice versa. In this paper, stochastic geometry graphs is used to model the AHWNs with eavesdroppers’ presence, then a simulation-based analysis method is proposed to investigate the characteristics of connectivity, hop count distribution, average hop count, and their relations in various scenarios. The proposed simulation-based analysis method consists of two algorithms. The first one finds all possible secure communication paths between two arbitrary legitimate users selected as source and destination and returns the shortest path's hop count. This algorithm utilizes the random locations of legitimate users and eavesdroppers, the wireless channel condition, and the eavesdropper's operating mode as input data. The second one provides the hop count distribution and the connection probability of the obtained multi-hop path of the first algorithm by averaging a huge number of network topology trials. So far, this paper is the first work that investigates both connectivity and hop count of security-aware multi-hop AHWNs. Moreover, these characteristics of multi-hop AHWNs with colluding eavesdroppers are compared with those of multi-hop AHWNs with non-colluding eavesdroppers and without eavesdroppers. Simulation results show that putting more legitimate users does not greatly improve the quality of the multi-hop path in the non-colluding case compared with that in colluding case. Furthermore, the shape parameter of Nakagami fading has a more substantial effect on the connectivity and hop count than the spread parameter. The results in this paper provide valuable insights in designing and evaluating security-aware multi-hop AHWNs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,Ad Hoc Networks,769

The non-adaptive frameworks do not handle this drift. Additionally, the focus has been on detecting local anomalies, such as a region of an image.

However, prevailing operating rules were constant, which is incapable to be dynamically updated based on new observations. To address this issue, adaptive complementary operating rules were developed to deal with the future uncertainties of reservoir inflow and solar radiation using ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). First, a long-term complementary optimization model was developed to derive the initial parameters of linear operating rules. Then, the optimal decisions under historical condition were used as the observation. Finally, six assimilation schemes were proposed, according to the two state transition equations (the same period of the previous year, the previous period) and three observations (the same period of the previous year, the previous period and their joint). China's Longyangxia hydro-PV hybrid power plant was chosen as a case study. Results show that (1) the two state transition equations have comparative effects on operation results, (2) the choice of observation plays a decisive role. The assimilation scheme, in which the optimal operation decision of the same period in previous year is as observation, outperforms the stationary operating rules. Specifically, the total power generation and guaranteed rate are improved by 7.14% and 5.33%, respectively, (3) the deriving framework works effectively under the synthetic nonstationary reservoir inflow and solar radiation, and ensures the stability and security of energy system in the changing environment. © 2021",Scopus,Applied Energy,772

However, time is a semantic property in CPS systems, and hence incorporating time in addition to data and events, is essential for obtaining high accuracy. This paper proposes ARTINALI++, which dynamically mines specifications in CPS systems with arbitrary size and complexity. ARTINALI++ captures the security properties by incorporating time as a substantial property of the system, and generate a multi-dimensional model for the general CPS systems. Moreover, it enhances the model through discovering invariants that represent the physical motions and distinct operational modes in complex CPS systems. We build Intrusion Detection Systems based on ARTINALI++ for three CPSes with various levels of complexity including smart meter, smart artificial pancreas and unmanned aerial vehicle, and measure their detection accuracy. We find that the ARTINALI++ significantly reduces the ratio of false positives and false negatives by 23.45% and 73.6% on average, respectively, over other dynamic specification mining tools on the three CPS platforms. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Scopus,Journal of Systems and Software,773

A three-step approach is developed to consider two offline and online environments, and the proposed scheme is designed. In Step-1, a comprehensive study of the microgrid dynamical model is investigated through two different distributed energy resources (DERs), including generator-based and inverter-based resources. In this step, based on the low-inertia concept, a dynamical model of an adaptive protection scheme is proposed through a set of non-model-based indexes. In Step-2, considering online evaluations of produced indexes, two different equations are provided in the form activation point and triggering point which the corresponding adaptive protective zones are provided. In this step, considering different operational and topological points of microgrid, the protective abilities of proposed indexes are validated and reorganized. Finally Step-3 concentrates on the ability of the proposed defensive scheme in real-time operating mode. In this step, considering different fault scenarios, the accuracy estimation and fast detection of the developed protection scheme are investigated, and the microgrid dynamic security is evaluated.

We develop and demonstrate a conditional entropy analysis that permits extraction of the key given a priori knowledge of state transitions as well as reverse engineering of the RNS PRNG algorithm and parameters (but not the key) in problems where the multiplicative RNS characteristic is too large to obtain a priori state transitions. We then discuss multiple defenses and perturbations for the RNS system that fool the original attack algorithm, including deliberate noise injection and code hopping.

Cloud offers utilizing the benefits through the web services. Objective: The degrading factors such as low Quality of Service, security factors, and less resource management in cloud lead to service suitability issue. In service-oriented computing, finding an efficient QoS based web service on the web is a very challenging task. Methods: A quality of service metric approach is proposed to identify the suitability of web services and ensuring the deployability in the cloud era. The suitability of web service is examined for its suitability cases (simple suitable, average suitable and best suitable) with respect to the quality of service attribute. Results: In the experimental setup, the suitability scores calculated with the essential non-functional quality of service attribute information are identified from the set of services. However, the verifi-cation process is expressed using the state transition diagram.

In the Republic of Serbia alone, the largest number of accidents occur at passive crossings, which make up three-quarters of the total number of crossings. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly find solutions to the problem of priorities when choosing level crossings where it is necessary to raise the level of security, primarily by analyzing the risk and reliability at all level crossings. This paper presents a model that enables this. The calculation of the maximal risk of a level crossing is achieved under the conditions of generating the maximum entropy in the virtual operating mode. The basis of the model is a heterogeneous queuing system. Maximum entropy is based on the mandatory application of an exponential distribution. The system is Markovian and is solved by a standard analytical concept. The basic input parameters for the calculation of the maximal risk are the geometric characteristics of the level crossing and the intensities and structure of the flows of road and railway vehicles. The real risk is based on statistical records of accidents and flow intensities. The exact reliability of the level crossing is calculated from the ratio of real and maximal risk, which enables their further comparison in order to raise the level of safety, and that is the basic idea of this paper. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, we propose two RHIBE schemes in composite-order bilinear groups and prove their adaptive security under simple static assumptions.

Data sharing has played an important role in the IoT, but the leakage of private user information poses a new security threat to the users. Thus, flexible fine-grained access control for such shared data is proposed in this article as an effective and secure method of eliminating vulnerabilities. However, the disclosure of access policies will also expose users' private information. Recently, Yang et al. attempted to solve this problem and proposed a framework based on attribute-based encryption for shared data onto IEEE IoT-J(DOI: 10.1109/JIOT.2016.2571718). They hide the access policies by using a bloom filter (BF) and attempt to address privacy preservation in IoT. However, we demonstrate several security weaknesses of their framework and point out its vulnerability to dictionary attacks and access policy guessing attacks. Then, an improved IoT solution is proposed. Under this proposal, the attribute values are stored in BF while the attribute names are embedded in the access policy. The proposed scheme can resist dictionary attacks and access policy guessing attacks. In addition, it simultaneously realizes large attribute sets, an efficient decryption algorithm, and adaptive security. Security analysis and performance evaluations show that the presented scheme achieves higher security and implementation simplicity in the IoT than other currently available schemes.  © 2014 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,781

However, cloud-assisted IoT is also becoming an increasingly attractive target for various cyber-attacks, including the authenticity of outsourcing data, untrustworthiness of third parties, and data security and privacy. As a potential and promising solution to securely outsource data, we present the first construction for an efficient cloud data outsourcing system with simultaneous individual transmission preserving outsider anonymity of the subscribed consumer set. In our system, a data owner generates personalized data for each of the consumers in a group and transmits a common encrypted data for the group in such a way that the subscribed consumer set is completely hidden from the outsiders. Personalized data can be recovered only by an authorized consumer, while the common data can be decrypted by all the authorized consumer in that group. The communication bandwidth is compact in our construction, and the decryption algorithm requires significantly less computation cost. We design our scheme using asymmetric bilinear map over the prime order group to prevent fault attacks on symmetric bilinear map. Our construction is built in identity-based setting without any non-standard q-type security assumption and does not use random oracles. Our scheme enjoys adaptive security against an indistinguishable chosen-plaintext attack under the hardness of the standard decisional bilinear Diffie–Hellman exponent problem. Furthermore, our design supports an exponential number of consumers as the size of the valid identity set grows exponentially with the security parameter, whereas it is only polynomial in the security parameter for the existing cloud data outsourcing systems. In particular, the implementation and performance analysis explicates the advantages of our design for resource-constrained IoT enabled frameworks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,Journal of Information Security and Applications,782

To mitigate the failure risk of safety-critical systems, a protective device is commonly designed to alleviate the damage caused by external shocks. In this paper, a multi-state system subject to shocks and supported by a protective device is considered. The protective device can be triggered to defense valid shocks when the system state is worse than a predetermined threshold. During the operating process of the protective device, the system is assumed to be failure-free due to the resistant effect of the protective device. After resisting a finite number of valid shocks for the system, the protective device loses the protective ability. A finite Markov chain imbedding method is employed to derive the system reliability characteristics. Based on the established reliability model, the state based triggering policy of the protective device is designed and an optimization model is constructed to determine the optimal triggering threshold.

Simultaneous quantification of the positive and negative effects of maintenance activities and components degradation effect makes it possible to accurately evaluate the risk criterion for safety systems of nuclear power plants. However, it is difficult to integrate the effects of maintenance and components degradation into the standard reliability approaches. A straightforward approach for considering components degradation and different maintenance policies is to make use of Markov maintenance models. In this article, the effectiveness of maintenance activities (including changes in the surveillance test intervals and alteration in the different maintenance policies) on the components unavailability with considering aging effects is quantified using Markov maintenance models and then by coupling these models and the fault tree method, the risk measure is upgraded from the component level to the system level. The proposed models are applied to evaluate the unavailability of two safety systems of VVER-1000/V446 nuclear power plants as case studies. The results show that the Markov method due to its multi-state nature is effective in the conservative evaluation of risk measures so that the unavailability computed by the coupling process is higher than the original unavailability (calculated by system fault tree using PSA data of nuclear power plants) for all maintenance policies. In addition, this study illustrates that the developed Markov maintenance models could be applied to the large-scale whole plant level and provides a proper transition from the classical PSA methods to new techniques. This approach integrates the effects of maintenance strategies and components degradation. Also, it provides a practical and a more accurate tool to determine the technical specification of a real nuclear power plant from the risk point of view. © Copyright © 2021 Mohammadhasani and Pirouzmand.",Scopus,Frontiers in Energy Research,785

Distinct layers of encryption have been utilized in proposed model for enhancing data security. Transmitter and receiver modules are designed for performing state transition based encrypted activities. Transmitter module is required for capturing environmental turbulences (noise) from a specific geographical location and send encrypted signal to receiver module through wireless network. Receiver module analyses received signal after decryption for desired activities based on real time situations. Different hardware components are selected and compared based on market study targeting efficient construction of proposed modules. Time complexity and code break complexity are measured using different key lengths, keysets, and data sizes for proposed CA based encryption scheme achieving unique results in hardware based cryptography system. Encryption key length, index, and keyset are required for computing code break complexity in design model. Large data size is effectively managed to calculate protection ratio and reliability factor for realizing efficient protectiveness and accuracy. Comparative study between existing encryption technique and proposed CA based encryption technique is established based on time complexity and code break complexity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,Wireless Personal Communications,787

The network communication is decayed and intermittently attacked by attackers, which may result in loss of transmission effectiveness and communication outage, respectively. A distributed adaptive consensus control strategy is firstly developed to ensure bounded consensus of the nonlinear multi-agent systems in the case of normal networks. Then, a novel adaptive neural network (NN)-based observer is proposed to observe decayed and intermittent transmission signals of networks in such a way to recover the original signals. Based on the adaptive control and NN-based observer schemes, distributed security control strategies are developed to achieve the bounded consensus of the multi-agent systems under the influence of network decay and intermittent attacks. The efficiency of the designed adaptive security control strategies are illustrated by a multiple coupled nonlinear forced pendulum system. © 2020",Scopus,Information Sciences,788

A systematic data-driven approach is proposed for detecting anomalies and analyzing the dynamics of IES vulnerability. Firstly, an anomaly detection method is introduced to determine whether there are anomalies in the system operation. The method can be set up even if the data labels for discriminating the anomalies are unknown, often the cause in practice. Secondly, a method of complex network phase theory is proposed to model information propagation among IES nodes representative of the IES physical entities. Complex network models can then be constructed to describe the system behavior in different operating conditions and over different time horizons. The degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality are used as indications to analyze changes in IES vulnerability. Finally, a method is proposed to identify the critical points of the IES from the point of view of its vulnerability. The new approach is applied to analyze the vulnerability of an IES in Spain. The results show that the proposed methods allow revealing system anomalies, vulnerability and weaknesses. Outcomes from an analysis by these methods can be used by managers to take defensive measures in advance for preventing and mitigating the impact of potential factors and threats on the IES. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,Energy Conversion and Management,789

Real-time assessment of the current power system operating state and increased awareness about plausible future insecurity can enable necessary operational and control measures to ensure secure operation. This paper proposes an ensemble decision tree (DT)-based online DSA method for large-scale interconnected power system networks using wide area measurement (WAMS) with phasor measurement units (PMU). A novel attribute selection method has been demonstrated for optimizing PMU installation at strategic buses in large-scale power networks. Multi-stage screening of the initial measurements has been done to minimize the data acquisition cost and computation overhead, which are the key challenges in real-time DSA. The ensemble DT classifier was trained offline using data from the operational model of the power system under different system loading and contingency conditions. The trained classifier provides online security assessment and classifies the power system’s current operating state as secure or insecure based on real-time measurements of the key attributes by selective PMUs. The proposed scheme was tested on IEEE 118-bus system, and the results demonstrate that it has the potential to be used as a reliable online DSA method. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,Electrical Engineering,791

Based on the actual modeling requirements of the network attack and defense process, a network defense decision-making model combining incomplete information stochastic game and deep reinforcement learning is proposed. This model regards the incomplete information of the attacker and the defender as the defender's uncertainty about the attacker's type and uses the Double Deep Q-Network algorithm to solve the problem of the difficulty of determining the network state transition probability, so that the network system can dynamically adjust the defense strategy. Finally, a simulation experiment was performed on the proposed model. The results show that, under the same experimental conditions, the proposed method in this paper has a better convergence speed than other methods in solving the defense equilibrium strategy.

The existing state-of-the-art solutions, extensively rely on human decision making and correlation-based analysis, to understand the anomalous intent of an insider. This consequently leads to data breaches, hence making insider threats one of the biggest challenges faced by the cybersecurity community today. To deal with these issues, new access control architectures and models must focus on the integration of threat analytics, auto-resiliency, and fast response time to mitigate an ongoing threat in a timely manner. In this article, to address these issues and limitations, we propose an integrated access control policy regulation framework, designed on biological principles. The proposed framework provides the ground to efficiently integrate Threat Analytics with Policy Regulation Mechanism against insider threats. Another major contribution of this article is to model access control policy regulation mechanism as an auto-regulatory state transition system, which could autonomously change its state (policy configuration) in real-time against an emergent insider threat. As the last step, with the help of formal methods, we rigorously verify, evaluate, and test the performance of our proposed systems on a real-life threat test dataset. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,Future Generation Computer Systems,793

Unlike many existing fault-tolerance techniques, BTR does not attempt to completely mask all symptoms of a fault; instead, it ensures that the system returns to the correct behavior within a bounded amount of time. This weaker guarantee is sufficient, e.g., for many cyber-physical systems, where physical properties - such as inertia and thermal capacity - prevent quick state changes and thus limit the damage that can result from a brief period of undefined behavior. We present an algorithm called REBOUND that can provide BTR for the Byzantine fault model. REBOUND works by detecting faults and then reconfiguring the system to exclude the faulty nodes. This supports very fine-grained responses to faults: for instance, the system can move or replace existing tasks, or drop less critical tasks entirely to conserve resources. REBOUND can take useful actions even when a majority of the nodes is compromised, and it requires less redundancy than full fault-tolerance. © 2021 ACM.",Scopus,EuroSys 2021 - Proceedings of the 16th European Conference on Computer Systems,794

Therefore, novel tools that are proactive, agile and continuous are imperative.

CSBAuditor leverages two concepts: state transition analysis and reconciler pattern to overcome the aforementioned security issues. Furthermore, security metrics are used to compute severity scores for detected vulnerabilities using a novel scoring system: Cloud Security Scoring System. CSBAuditor has been evaluated using various strategies including security chaos engineering (fault injection) strategies on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.

Our goal is to construct actively secure MPC protocols where parties are corrupted adaptively by an adversary (as in the standard adaptive security setting), and in addition, honest parties’ machines are compromised. The idea of reverse firewalls (RF) was introduced at EUROCRYPT’15 by Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz as an approach to protecting protocols against corruption of honest parties’ devices. Intuitively, an RF for a party P is an external entity that sits between P and the outside world and whose scope is to sanitize P ’s incoming and outgoing messages in the face of subversion of their computer. Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz constructed a protocol for passively-secure two-party computation. At CRYPTO’20, Chakraborty, Dziembowski and Nielsen constructed a protocol for secure computation with firewalls that improved on this result, both by extending it to multi-party computation protocol, and considering active security in the presence of static corruptions. In this paper, we initiate the study of RF for MPC in the adaptive setting. We put forward a definition for adaptively secure MPC in the reverse firewall setting, explore relationships among the security notions, and then construct reverse firewalls for MPC in this stronger setting of adaptive security. We also resolve the open question of Chakraborty, Dziembowski and Nielsen by removing the need for a trusted setup in constructing RF for MPC. Towards this end, we construct reverse firewalls for adaptively secure augmented coin tossing and adaptively secure zero-knowledge protocols and obtain a constant round adaptively secure MPC protocol in the reverse firewall setting without setup. Along the way, we propose a new multi-party adaptively secure coin tossing protocol in the plain model, that is of independent interest. © 2021, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),798

Furthermore, a dynamic scheduling algorithm based on executor credit and heterogeneity is proposed. The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional smart grid security architecture, the PHSA has better defense ability and system reliability, significantly improving the security of edge enabled smart grid system. Besides, compared with the random scheduling strategy, the proposed dynamic executor scheduling algorithm can further improve the security of the system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,Sustainable Cities and Society,799

In this paper, we propose a formal approach to achieve self-protection by performing security analysis on self-adaptive systems, taking the adaptation process into account. We use probabilistic model checking to quantitatively analyze adaptation security, rank the strategies available and select the most secure one to apply in the system. We have incorporated our approach in Rainbow which is a framework to develop architecture-based self-adaptive systems. To evaluate our approach's effectiveness, we applied it on two case studies: a simple document storage system and ZNN, a well known self-adaptive exemplar. The results show that applying our approach can guarantee a reasonable degree of security, both during and after adaptation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,Future Generation Computer Systems,800

The updated standard, released in 2018 with revisions ongoing, specifies the need for more flexible settings, requiring the DER to remain connected during certain disturbances and provide voltage support via active and reactive power modes. With these increased capabilities comes increased risks, and our analysis of the standard has produced potential settings combinations, which, while allowable under the standard, may actually create instability. This contradicts the main purpose of the revised standard. Since the DER must support a communication interface through which the AEPS operator can change settings, adversarial mode changes are possible via a cyberattack. This concern is heightened as DER penetration increases, where under a reasonable threat model, an attacker could affect multiple DER simultaneously. We have conducted a simulation analysis of potentially adverse combinations of mode change and ride-through parameters on a hypothetical AEPS with varying degrees of DER penetration. We conclude that certain adverse mode changes, whether through error or cyberattack, can lead to unstable conditions with DER penetrations as low as 24% of the AEPS system capacity. © 2021 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Green Technologies Conference,804

These sources provide clean energy. The integration of RES with conventional energy generation units via the electrical grid can lead to new challenges such as security of supply, baseload capacity frequency synchronization, environmental effects, and so on. The group of microsources and loads, running as a separate governable entity providing power to the provincial field, is termed a “microgrid.” Renewable-based microsources can create challenges in the administration of energy due to their dependence on atmospheric status. By virtue of the sporadic nature of RES, power quality degrades. To maintain power quality and system authenticity, different microgrid configurations are used in conjunction with RES and customized power devices. The basic operation of a microgrid lies in generation and demand. Therefore two different operating modes are discussed: autonomous and grid-tied modes. In autonomous mode, the microsources are connected to the load, and necessary control action is taken by these sources via a centralized or decentralized control system to uphold harmony between active and reactive power. In grid-tied mode, the microsources act as a single generating unit in the grid. Frequency and voltage stability are overseen by an infinite grid. Proper design is required for reliable operation of the microgrid. In the microgrid, new RES are identified as clean sources of energy, converters for power quality enhancement, and loads to consume the energy. The presence of RES creates new challenges such as DC output, variable frequency, or AC output to maintain the stability of the grid. Therefore suitable architecture and complex control are required to manage the power flow with different microsources, loads, and grids. Three major configurations were defined in the literature as architecture of the microgrid: AC grid, DC grid, and hybrid grid (AC/DC grid). The advantages and disadvantages of these configurations are discussed in this chapter. There are a number of policies associated with a microgrid and its challenges that allow it to move toward the smart grid of the future. The benefits of RES, energy storage systems, and new architecture in the microgrid for reliable operation of a system and to maintain the flow of power are also discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Currently, IBE is known to be realizable from most mainstream number theoretic assumptions that imply public key cryptography including factoring, the search Diffie-Hellman assumption, and the Learning with Errors assumption. Our core construction provides security against an attacker that makes a single key query for a machine T before declaring a challenge string w∗ that is associated with the challenge ciphertext. We build our construction by leveraging a Garbled RAM construction of Gentry, Halevi, Raykova and Wichs [33]; however, to prove security we need to introduce a new notion of security called iterated simulation security. We then show how to transform our core construction into one that is secure for an a-priori bounded number q= q(λ) of key queries that can occur either before or after the challenge ciphertext. We do this by first showing how one can use a special type of non-committing encryption to transform a system that is secure only if a single key is chosen before the challenge ciphertext is declared into one where the single key can be requested either before or after the challenge ciphertext. We give a simple construction of this non-committing encryption from public key encryption in the Random Oracle Model. Next, one can apply standard combinatorial techniques to lift from single-key adaptive security to q-key adaptive security. © 2021, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),807

To date the main paradigm for achieving adaptive security in ABE is dual system encryption. However, almost all such solutions in bilinear groups rely on (variants of) either the subgroup decision problem over composite order groups or the decision linear assumption. Both of these assumptions are decisional rather than search assumptions and the target of the assumption is a source or bilinear group element. This is in contrast to earlier selectively secure ABE systems which can be proven secure from either the decisional or search Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption. In this work we make progress on closing this gap by giving a new ABE construction for the subset functionality and prove security under the Search Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption. We first provide a framework for proving adaptive security in Attribute-Based Encryption systems. We introduce a concept of ABE with deletable attributes where any party can take a ciphertext encrypted under the attribute string x∈ { 0, 1 }n and modify it into a ciphertext encrypted under any string x′∈ { 0, 1, ⊥}n where x′ is derived by replacing any bits of x with ⊥ symbols (i.e. “deleting” attributes of x). The semantics of the system are that any private key for a circuit C can be used to decrypt a ciphertext associated with x′ if none of the input bits read by circuit C are ⊥ symbols and C(x′) = 1. We show a pathway for combining ABE with deletable attributes with constrained pseudorandom functions to obtain adaptively secure ABE building upon the recent work of Tsabary [30]. Our new ABE system will be adaptively secure and be a ciphertext-policy ABE that supports the same functionality as the underlying constrained PRF as long as the PRF is “deletion conforming”. Here we also provide a simple constrained PRF construction that gives subset functionality. Our approach enables us to access a broader array of Attribute-Based Encryption schemes support deletion of attributes. For example, we show that both the Goyal et al. (GPSW) [19] and Boyen [6] ABE schemes can trivially handle a deletion operation. And, by using a hardcore bit variant of GPSW scheme we obtain an adaptively secure ABE scheme under the Search Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in addition to pseudo random functions in NC1. This gives the first adaptively secure ABE from a search assumption as all prior work relied on decision assumptions over source group elements. © 2021, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),813

Eight different modes of operation can be selected based on the map graph (concave or convex), the range modification procedure (shrinking or widening) and the sign of one of its independent parameters. The generalization and modification preserve the controllability and continuous chaotic behavior properties, respectively. For the same encryption key and map equation, multi-mode operation occurs through switching between four alternatives of the dependent parameters. Switching between various modes is shown to overpass single modes in randomness by investigating the frequency distribution, autocorrelation function, histograms and 0-1 test. In addition, most bits, 75%, of the scaled and quantized chaotic output are shown to be suitable for pseudo-random number generation based on National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) statistical test suite. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated for several speech, grayscale and RGB images through various evaluation criteria, where good results are achieved. These criteria include basic perceptual and statistical aspects, the more advanced NIST tests, key sensitivity and robustness against brute force and differential attacks. The efficiency of the scheme is improved by up to three or six times faster than encrypting one sample or one channel of a pixel at a time for speech and image inputs, respectively.

In this work, we improve the state of affairs for bounded collusion FE in several ways: 1.New Security Notion. We introduce the notion of dynamic bounded collusion FE, where the declaration of collusion bound is delayed to the time of encryption. This enables the encryptor to dynamically choose the collusion bound for different ciphertexts depending on their individual level of sensitivity. Hence, the ciphertext size grows linearly with its own collusion bound and the public key size is independent of collusion bound. In contrast, all prior constructions have public key and ciphertext size that grow at least linearly with a fixed bound Q.2.CPFE for circuits with Dynamic Bounded Collusion. We provide the first CPFE schemes for circuits enjoying dynamic bounded collusion security. By assuming identity based encryption (IBE), we construct CPFE for circuits of unbounded size satisfying non-adaptive simulation based security. By strengthening the underlying assumption to IBE with receiver selective opening security, we obtain CPFE for circuits of bounded size enjoying adaptive simulation based security. Moreover, we show that IBE is a necessary assumption for these primitives. Furthermore, by relying on the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption, we obtain the first succinct CPFE for circuits, i.e. supporting circuits with unbounded size, but fixed output length and depth. This scheme achieves adaptive simulation based security.3.KPFE for circuits with dynamic bounded collusion. We provide the first KPFE for circuits of unbounded size, but bounded depth and output length satisfying dynamic bounded collusion security from LWE. Our construction achieves adaptive simulation security improving security of [20].4.KP and CP FE for TM/NL with dynamic bounded collusion.

Our constructions achieve non-adaptive simulation based security. Both the input and the machine in our construction can be of unbounded polynomial length.We provide a variant of the above scheme that satisfies adaptive security, but at the cost of supporting a smaller class of computation, namely Nondeterministic Logarithmic-space (NL).

In terms of anti-jamming performance, because the satellite signal arrives at the ground with weak intensity and is vulnerable to electromagnetic interference, the positioning results are not available. Objective: Therefore, in complex electromagnetic environment, the anti-jamming navigation receiving terminal is needed, and the interference nulling or beam pointing can be achieved by using mul-ti-element antenna array with anti-jamming algorithm. Methods: Accordingly to requirements, the development trend of navigation receiving terminal is from single mode to multi-mode and miniaturization. A miniaturized 7-element anti-jamming antenna array is proposed. It mainly aims at GPS L1 and L2 frequency points. All elements adopt ce-ramic substrate microstrip antenna. The array elements adopt laminated design to effectively reduce the antenna aperture. The spacing between elements at two frequency points is not greater than half wavelength, which can ensure the back-end anti-jamming algorithm performance, and its performance and characteristics are verified through related experiments and simulations. Results: Anti-jamming algorithm performance, and its performance and characteristics are verified through related experiments and simulations.

Cyber security breaches in such robots undermine the trust between humans and robots. In this paper, we investigate how to apprehend and inflict security threats at the design and implementation stage of an autonomous mobile robot. To this end, we leverage the idea of directed fuzzing and design ROBOFUZZthat systematically tests an autonomous mobile robot in line with the robot's states and the surrounding environment. The methodology of ROBOFUZZis to study critical environmental parameters affecting the robot's state transitions and subject the robot control program with rational but harmful sensor values so as to compromise the robot. Furthermore, we develop detection and mitigation algorithms to counteract the impact of ROBOFUZZ. The difficulties mainly lie in the trade-off among limited computation resources, timely detection and the retention of work efficiency in mitigation. In particular, we propose detection and mitigation methods that take advantage of historical records of obstacles to detect inconsistent obstacle appearances regarding untrustworthy sensor values and navigate the movable robot to continue moving so as to carry on a planned task. By doing so, we manage to maintain a low cost for detection and mitigation but also retain the robot's work efficacy. We have prototyped the bundle of ROBOFUZZ, detection and mitigation algorithms in a real-world movable robot. Experimental results confirm that ROBOFUZZmakes a success rate of up to 93.3% in imposing concrete threats to the robot while the overall loss of work efficacy is merely 4.1% at the mitigation mode. © 2020",Scopus,Journal of Systems Architecture,823

Unlike for many other cryptographic building blocks (like public-key encryption, signatures, or zero-knowledge proofs), all known NIKE security reductions to date are non-tight, i.e., lose a factor of at least the number of users in the system. In that sense, NIKE forms a particularly elusive target for tight security reductions. The main technical obstacle in achieving tightly secure NIKE schemes are adaptive corruptions. Hence, in this work, we explore security notions and schemes that lie between selective security and fully adaptive security. Concretely: We exhibit a tradeoff between key size and reduction loss. We show that a tighter reduction can be bought by larger public and secret NIKE keys. Concretely, we present a simple NIKE scheme with a reduction loss of O(N2log (ν) / ν2), and public and secret keys of O(ν) group elements, where N denotes the overall number of users in the system, and ν is a freely adjustable scheme parameter. Our scheme achieves full adaptive security even against multiple “test queries” (i.e., adversarial challenges), but requires keys of size O(N) to achieve (almost) tight security under the matrix Diffie-Hellman assumption. Still, already this simple scheme circumvents existing lower bounds. We show that this tradeoff is inherent. We contrast the security of our simple scheme with a lower bound for all NIKE schemes in which shared keys can be expressed as an “inner product in the exponent”. This result covers the original Diffie-Hellman NIKE scheme, as well as a large class of its variants, and in particular our simple scheme. Our lower bound gives a tradeoff between the “dimension” of any such scheme (which directly corresponds to key sizes in existing schemes), and the reduction quality. For ν= O(N), this shows our simple scheme and reduction optimal (up to a logarithmic factor). We exhibit a tradeoff between security and key size for tight reductions. We show that it is possible to circumvent the inherent tradeoff above by relaxing the desired security notion. Concretely, we consider the natural notion of semi-adaptive security, where the adversary has to commit to a single test query after seeing all public keys. As a feasibility result, we bring forward the first scheme that enjoys compact public keys and tight semi-adaptive security under the conjunction of the matrix Diffie-Hellman and learning with errors assumptions. We believe that our results shed a new light on the role of adaptivity in NIKE security, and also illustrate the special role of NIKE when it comes to tight security reductions. © 2021, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),824

The approach is based on the analysis of the functioning processes of modern quality control systems for information security in supply chain. In addition, it is based on an analysis of decision support processes. We use controlled Markov chains, represented by difference stochastic equations. The considered version of the analytical description of the state change in dynamics allows one to formalize, structure, and mathematically describe the process of this class from a uniform perspective. It is important to note that with this representation of the dynamics of state transitions, the requirements for operativity (timeliness), reliability, secrecy and resource costs for supporting decision-making to control information security in the supply chain are taken into account. © 2021.

Their detection capacity is therefore strongly linked to the representativeness of these datasets and the attacks they address. Actually, few datasets focus on the specificities of Industry 4.0 and even less propose a realistic labeled dataset. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to propose an industrial labeled dataset.

SMS of a workstation are executed on the protected node and monitor various security events, collect and analyze information reflecting the activity taking place in the operating system of a separate computer. Application-level SMSs and DMSs collect and analyze information from specific applications such as Web servers, firewalls, or database management systems. Network layer SMSs collect information from network traffic. They can be performed on ordinary or specialized computers, and also can be integrated into routers or switches. The article discusses the features of the practical implementation of SMS in CSN. Based on the analysis of the problems arising during the functioning of security monitoring tools in modern CSN, the main research area is highlighted - the development of methods and means of security monitoring that ensure an increase in the effectiveness of SMS against the actions of malicious intent by: predicting possible actions of intruders; dynamic analysis of risks of implementation of threats to the security of information resources; recommendations to the adaptive security management system for reconfiguring/modifying protection when the threat level changes.

To address this challenge, verification method is implemented to achieve high level security in the cloud environment. Many researchers have provided different authentication mechanisms to safeguard virtual machines from attacks. In this paper, Multi Stage Authentication is proposed to overcome the threats from attackers towards virtual machines. In order to authorize and access the virtual machine, multistage authentication incorporating the factors like username, email id, password and OTP is carried out.

Therefore, static security solutions were proposed, both by researchers and car manufacturers, to secure the Intra-Electric Vehicle Sensors network (IVSN). However, these solutions are energy-intensive and could deplete the battery along the travel, affecting the driver safety.For this purpose, we aim to propose an adaptive security solution, called RIsk-based Context-Aware security solution for the intra-Vehicle network (RICAV), that considers the electric vehicle context (energy, distance to the charging stations, traffic state, etc) and the risk assessment value to provide a trade-off between security and energy consumption.

These connections go hand in hand with security vulnerabilities and potential threats to these devices. In regular IT systems, we typically provide updates to eliminate vulnerabilities. In industrial automation and control systems, especially in mass production, legacy systems are widespread and installing updates causes downtime. Availability is one of the top goals; stopping a machine in case of a cyber-security threat is often too expensive. But, system integrators and asset owners should not have to wait until product or component suppliers release appropriate updates. Due to safety and warranty requirements, developing and distributing updates can take a long time. In the meantime, attackers can pose threats by taking advantage of devices' known vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose the design of resilient systems based on multi-modal architectures with several operational modes. When vulnerabilities of systems become known, or when systems get even attacked at some point, mode switching can overcome the time between vulnerability disclosure or attack, and the availability of corresponding security patches. Therefore, system integrators and asset owners can actively protect themselves by implicitly or explicitly switching to modes with reduced attack surfaces and, thus, with limited ranges of activity for attackers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

With the explosion of the Artificial Intelligence concept, such interfaces have begun to fill the gap between the user and the system itself, further evolving in Adaptive User Interfaces (AUI). Meta Interfaces are a further step towards the user, and they aim at supporting the human activities in an ambient interactive space; in such a way, the user can control the surrounding space and interact with it. This work aims at proposing a meta user interface that exploits the Put That There paradigm to enable the user to fast interaction by employing natural language and gestures. The application scenario is a video surveillance control room, in which the speed of actions and reactions is fundamental for urban safety and driver and pedestrian security. The interaction is oriented towards three environments: the first is the control room itself, in which the operator can organize the views of the monitors related to the cameras on site by vocal commands and gestures, as well as conveying the audio on the headset or in the speakers of the room. The second one is related to the control of the video, in order to go back and forth to a particular scene showing specific events, or zoom in/out a particular camera; the third allows the operator to send rescue vehicle in a particular street, in case of need. The gestures data are acquired through a Microsoft Kinect 2 which captures pointing and gestures allowing the user to interact multimodally thus increasing the naturalness of the interaction; the related module maps the movement information to a particular instruction, also supported by vocal commands which enable its execution. Vocal commands are mapped by means of the LUIS (Language Understanding) framework by Microsoft, which helps to yield a fast deploy of the application; furthermore, LUIS guarantees the possibility to extend the dominion related command list so as to constantly improve and update the model. A testbed procedure investigates both the system usability and multimodal recognition performances. Multimodal sentence error rate (intended as the number of incorrectly recognized utterances even for a single item) is around 15%, given by the combination of possible failures both in the ASR and gesture recognition model. However, intent classification performances present, on average across different users, accuracy ranging around 89–92% thus indicating that most of the errors in multimodal sentences lie on the slot filling task. Usability has been evaluated through task completion paradigm (including interaction duration and activity on affordances counts per task), learning curve measurements, a posteriori questionnaires. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),832

In IoMT devices within a range of product areas, the confidentiality of patients’ health data transmission and privacy is still a big problem. In this paper, the Multi-Modal Secure Data Dissemination Framework (MMSDDF) has been proposed based on blockchain in IoMT for secure patient data access and control.

In this case, the prevention and counteraction to unauthorized intrusions is based on active reconnaissance, processing large amounts of information stored and circulating on the Internet, creating of industry and national cyber security centers. This article considers the approach to the establishment of ADS, which use Internet resources of social networks, information from DB of international and national defense centers and also prehistory of computer corporative network attacks.

An issue has been revealed related to the reasoned selection of modeling approaches at different stages of the software safety testing process and the identification of its vulnerabilities, which reduces the accuracy of the modeling results obtained. Two steps in the process of identifying software vulnerabilities have been identified. A mathematical model has been built for the process of preparing security testing, which differs from the known ones by a theoretically sound choice of the moment-generating functions when describing transitions from state to state. In addition, the mathematical model takes into consideration the capabilities and risks of the source code verification phase for cryptographic and other ways to protect data. These features generally improve the accuracy of modeling results and reduce input uncertainty in the second phase of software safety testing. An advanced security compliance algorithm has been developed, with a distinctive feature of the selection of laws and distribution parameters that describe individual state-to-state transitions for individual branches of Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique networks (GERT-networks). A GERT-network has been developed to prepare for security testing. A GERT-network for the process of checking the source code for cryptographic and other data protection methods has been developed. A graphic-analytical GERT model for the first phase of software safety testing has been developed.

The necessity to maintain network connectivity increases costs, introduces cybersecurity risks, and significantly limits the number of places where the terminals can be installed. Leading payment service providers have proposed offline payment solutions that rely on algorithmically generated payment tokens. Existing payment token solutions, however, require complex mechanisms for authentication, transaction management, and most importantly, security risk management. In this paper, we present VolgaPay, a blockchain-based system that allows merchants to deploy secure offline payment terminal infrastructure that does not require collection and storage of any sensitive data. We design a novel payment protocol which mitigates security threats for all the participants of VolgaPay, such that the maximum loss from gaining full access to any component by an adversary incurs only a limited scope of harm. We achieve significant enhancements in security, operation efficiency, and cost reduction via a combination of polynomial multi-hash chain micropayment channels and blockchain grafting for off-chain channel state transition. We implement the VolgaPay payment system, and with thorough evaluation and security analysis, we demonstrate that VolgaPay is capable of delivering a fast, secure, and cost-efficient solution for offline payment terminals. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.",Scopus,"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering, LNICST",838

The top-down Universal Modeling Language (UML) service orientation enabled a unified co-design of both human and machine communications. Furthermore, the present concept includes an integrated subscription mechanism for people and devices, in a multi-tier user structure and a central-local distributed processing (Cloud-Edge). There are presented the end-user perspective, selection and involvement (in pilot prototyping of the SAVE demonstrator), considering cognitive age-related issues, oriented on usability and on the functional specifications of interfacing via web-apps (independent of the mobile platforms operating system).

These services of “orientation” – localization, real-time tracking – are integrated with another aspect of “restoring the referential” (both personal and communitarian): (re-) planning service, improving alert information in case of emergency, bilateral push-pull of security notifications. Restoring the end-users well-being takes benefit of eHealth and actigraphy services.

In this approach, system engineers develop and simulate system models composed of hardware and software requirements using MBD tools like Simulink, Stateflow or SCADE etc. In recent years, formal methods are gaining popularity in the safety and security critical reliable systems. This article deals with a deeper understanding of application of formal methods. The formal methods ensure that the implementation of a software product should satisfy the requirements specification. They help in identifying ambiguous requirements and expose flaws in the system and software requirements. They help in writing disambiguate system specifications and articulate implicate assumptions. This article includes a design study of formal methods for autopilot mode transition and voter logic validation using model checking. The autopilot mode transition and voter logic is implemented using Simulink and S-functions.

Despite the fact that manufacturers strive to provide a high level of protection for units, car owners set operating modes that, in some parameters, exceed the values provided for manufacturers. This leads to failures of the electronic control unit. The article considers the analysis of designed reliability and maintainability of modern unit controls systems, and active safety of the Bosch and Continental-Teves illustrates two designs used most frequently in the automotive industry. In addition, it should be noted that the cost of these units is quite high, which increases the relevance of the maintainability of electronic control units. In addition, the operation of these systems in conditions different from the design leads to operation in supercritical modes. For example, the intersection of large irregularities is located on the road at high speed and with a high repetition rate. This can lead to the damage in the electronic components, especially surface mounting and conductors, caused by vibration. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Mechanical Engineering,841

However, a major problem still remains unaddressed-the lack of solutions that work across buildings while not using additional infrastructure and also accounting for privacy and reliability needs. A privacy-preserving, multi-modal, cross-building, collaborative localization platform is proposed based on Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) (existing infrastructure), Cellular RSSI, sound, light, and geo-magnetic levels, that enables sub-room level localization. The solution is fully based on mobile phones and existing Wi-Fi infrastructure, and has privacy inherently built into it via cryptographically-secured onion routing and perturbation/randomization techniques. It also exploits the idea of weighted collaboration to increase the reliability as well as to limit the effect of noisy devices (due to sensor noise/privacy). The solution has been analyzed in terms of latency overhead due to onion-routing, request load on phones, privacy-accuracy tradeoffs, optimum parameters, granularity, different classification algorithms using real location data collected at multiple indoor and outdoor locations via an Android application. The additional features other than Wi-Fi RSSI values are shown to increase the accuracy to a maximum of 15 percent, while considering Geo-magnetic field is shown to enhance the granularity from 2:5 mto ≈1 m, a 60 percent improvement.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,842

One such important task is the task of anomaly detection where we are interested in detecting the deviation of the current behaviour of the system from the theoretically expected. In this work, we utilize the joint representation from the distributed traces and system log data for the task of anomaly detection in distributed systems. We demonstrate that the joint utilization of traces and logs produced better results compared to the single modality anomaly detection methods. Furthermore, we formalize a learning task - next template prediction NTP, that is used as a generalization for anomaly detection for both logs and distributed trace. Finally, we demonstrate that this formalization allows for the learning of template embedding for both the traces and logs.

We consider the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) as the most dangerous type of flooding attack that could target those resources. The DDoS attack consumes network available resources such as bandwidth, processing power, and memory, thereby limiting or withholding accessibility to users. The Flash Crowd (FC) is quite similar to the DDoS attack whereby many legitimate users concurrently access a particular service, the number of which results in the denial of service. Researchers have proposed many different models to eliminate the risk of DDoS attacks, but only few efforts have been made to differentiate it from FC flooding as FC flooding also causes the denial of service and usually misleads the detection of the DDoS attacks. In this paper, an adaptive agent-based model, known as an Adaptive Protection of Flooding Attacks (APFA) model, is proposed to protect the Network Application Layer (NAL) against DDoS flooding attacks and FC flooding traffics. The APFA model, with the aid of an adaptive analyst agent, distinguishes between DDoS and FC abnormal traffics. It then separates DDoS botnet from Demons and Zombies to apply suitable attack handling methodology. There are three parameters on which the agent relies, normal traffic intensity, traffic attack behavior, and IP address history log, to decide on the operation of two traffic filters. We test and evaluate the APFA model via a simulation system using CIDDS as a standard dataset. The model successfully adapts to the simulated attack scenarios' changes and determines 303,024 request conditions for the tested 135,583 IP addresses. It achieves an accuracy of 0.9964, a precision of 0.9962, and a sensitivity of 0.9996, and outperforms three tested similar models. In addition, the APFA model contributes to identifying and handling the actual trigger of DDoS attack and differentiates it from FC flooding, which is rarely implemented in one model.  © 2021 Bashar Ahmad Khalaf et al.",Scopus,Security and Communication Networks,844

Machine learning techniques are posing an increasingly important role in the field of malware identification and analysis. However, due to the complexity of the problem, the training of intelligent systems proves to be insufficient in recognizing advanced cyberthreats. The biggest challenge in information systems security using machine learning methods is to understand the polymorphism and metamorphism mechanisms used by malware developers and how to effectively address them. This work presents an innovative Artificial Evolutionary Fuzzy LSTM Immune System which, by using a heuristic machine learning method that combines evolutionary intelligence, Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and fuzzy knowledge, proves to be able to adequately protect modern information system from Portable Executable Malware. The main innovation in the technical implementation of the proposed approach is the fact that the machine learning system can only be trained from raw bytes of an executable file to determine if the file is malicious. The performance of the proposed system was tested on a sophisticated dataset of high complexity, which emerged after extensive research on PE malware that offered us a realistic representation of their operating states. The high accuracy of the developed model significantly supports the validity of the proposed method.

We further require the systems to be, both, adaptively secure (i.e., secure against a strong adversary making corruption decisions dynamically during the protocol), and non-interactive (i.e., where decryption servers do not interact amongst themselves but rather efficiently contribute, each, a single message).

As a result, myriad complex, non-traditional Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have emerged, characterized by interaction among people, physical facilities, and embedded sensors and computers, all generating vast amounts of complex data. Such a case is encountered within a contemporary airport hall setting: passengers roaming, information systems governing various functions, and data being generated and processed by cameras, phones, sensors, and other Internet of Things technology. This setting has considerable potential of contributing to goals entertained by the CPS operators, such as airlines, airport operators/owners, technicians, users, and more. We model the airport setting as an instance of such a complex, data-intensive CPS where multiple actors and data sources interact, and generalize a methodology to support it and other similar systems. Furthermore, this article instantiates the methodology and pipeline for predictive analytics for passenger flow, as a characteristic manifestation of such systems requiring a tailored approach. Our methodology also draws from DataOps principles, using multi-modal and real-life data to predict the underlying distribution of the passenger flow on a flight-level basis (improving existing day-level predictions), anticipating when and how the passengers enter the airport and move through the check-in and baggage drop-off process. This allows to plan airport resources more efficiently while improving customer experience by avoiding passenger clumping at check-in and security.

A generalized model of such a system based on the state and observation equations taking into account advanced algorithms for converting excitation noise (spectral power density of excitation noise) is investigated. Moreover, the model is a formalized analytical description specified in terms of the Markov chain in the form of different stochastic equations. The dynamics of changes in the values of quality indicators characterizing the essential properties of the SIEM system functioning in the state space are analyzed. A mechanism for determining the values of the mathematical expectation increment of the simulated process is proposed. These values are obtained on the basis of a priori data on the Markov chain with respect to the mathematical expectation of white Gaussian noise exciting this process. The specified mechanism is used in conjunction with the calculation of the values of the coefficient that corrects the variance of random discrete realizations of the original white Gaussian noise.

However, key transmission section identified by analysis of typical power system operating modes may not match power grid real-time operation situation when power grid structure is seriously damaged. Therefore, an online identification method of key transmission section considering cross-region faults and security and stability control measures is proposed in order to identify the weak sections that need to be concerned in power grid monitoring. Firstly, power flow distribution characteristics under different faults are analyzed based on results of online static stability analysis. Secondly, power flow transfer channels with different faults are identified and combined into transmission sections for thermal stability. The key transmission sections for thermal stability are screened by power transfer limit and margin calculation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by Northwest Power Grid. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,850

Commonly used micro-architectural covert channels are those that leave lasting footprints in the micro-architectural state, for example, a cache state change, from which the secret is recovered after the transient execution is completed. In this paper, we present SpectreRewind, a new approach to create and exploit contention-based covert channels for transient execution attacks. In our approach, a covert channel is established by issuing the necessary instructions logically before the transiently executed victim code. Unlike prior contention based covert channels, which require simultaneous multi-threading (SMT), SpectreRewind supports covert channels based on a single hardware thread, making it viable on systems where the attacker cannot utilize SMT. We show that contention on the floating point division unit on commodity processors can be used to create a high-performance (∼100 KB/s), low-noise covert channel for transient execution attacks instead of commonly used flush+reload based cache covert channels. We also show that the proposed covert channel works in the JavaScript sandbox environment of a Chrome browser. © 2020 ACM.",Scopus,ASHES 2020 - Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Attacks and Solutions in Hardware Security,852

In order to solve such two problems for system DDoS, this paper proposes a novel DDoS attack real-time defense mechanism based on deep Q-learning network (DQN). This mechanism regards the terminal adaptive control system as the protection object, periodically extracts the network attack characteristic parameters, and takes such parameters as the input parameters of the deep Q-learning network. Our defense measures are based on dynamic service resource allocation, which dynamically adjusts the service resource according to the current operating state of the system. The current operating state will ensure the response rate of normal service requests. Finally, the attack and defense processes are modeled and simulated using colored Petri network (CPN) combined with DQN. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism has real-time and high sensitivity defense for the response to DDoS attacks. The proposed mechanism significantly improves the automation degree of system defense. By using such a mechanism in the real-time defense of DDoS attacks, the system will be safer than the state-of-the-art mechanisms.  © 2020 Totem Publisher, Inc.",Scopus,International Journal of Performability Engineering,856

In access control models, the administration of access control policies is a task of paramount importance for distributed systems. A crucial analysis problem is to foresee if a set of administrators can give a user an unauthorized access permission. In this paper, we consider the analysis problem in the context of the administrative role-based access control (ARBAC) and its extension, the administrative temporal role-based access control (ATRBAC). More details, we present how to design analysis techniques, namely asasp2.1 and asaspTIME2.0 for ARBAC and ATRBAC, respectively, which are based on the ideas of a framework to analyze infinite state-transition systems. Moreover, we describe how we design heuristics to enable the analysis techniques to scale up to handle large and complex authorization policies.

In this paper, we investigate unsupervised anomaly detection on multidimensional time series data in IoT systems, and develops a GRU-based Gaussian Mixture VAE scheme, called GGM-VAE. In particular, we employ Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells to discover the correlations among time series data, and use Gaussian Mixture priors in the latent space to characterize the multimodal data. Several previous works assume simple distributions for Gaussian Mixture priors, resulting in insufficient ability to fully capture the data patterns. To overcome this issue, we design a model selection mechanism during the training process under the guidance of Bayesian Inference Criterion (BIC) to find the model which can well estimate the distribution in the Gaussian Mixture latent space. We conduct extensive simulations on four datasets and observe that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection schemes and achieves up to 47.88% improvement in F1 scores on average. © 2013 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering,860

One of them is cyber-situational awareness as well as dynamic and static risk analysis. A specific design method for a multimodal human-computer interface (HCI) for cyber-security events visualisation control is presented. The main role of the interface is to support security analysts and network operators in their monitoring activities. The proposed method of designing HCIs is adapted from the methodology of robot control system design. Both kinds of systems act by acquiring information from the environment, and utilise it to drive the devices influencing the environment. In the case of robots the environment is purely physical, while in the case of HCIs it encompasses both the physical ambience and part of the cyber-space. The goal of the designed system is to efficiently support a human operator in the presentation of cyberspace events such as incidents or cyber-attacks. Especially manipulation of graphical information is necessary. As monitoring is a continuous and tiring activity, control of how the data is presented should be exerted in as natural and convenient way as possible. Hence two main visualisation control modalities have been assumed for testing: Static and dynamic gesture commands and voice commands, treated as supplementary to the standard interaction. The presented multimodal interface is a component of the Operational Centre, which is a part of the National Cybersecurity Platform. Creation of the interface out of embodied agents proved to be very useful in the specification phase and facilitated the interface implementation. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences.

The attacker can allocate resources to intelligence actions to distinguish false targets from genuine targets. Analogously, the defender can expend efforts on disinformation actions to prevent the false targets from being detected. The probability that a target is detected depends on the effort exerted by both parties. In this defense and attack model, the defender moves first and allocates its resources to overarching protection, disinformation actions, and individual protection to minimize system destruction probability, assuming that the attacker has full knowledge of its actions and will always employ the most harmful attack strategy. The attacker allocates its resources to overarching protection penetration, intelligence actions, and individual attacks to maximize system destruction probability. We formulate the defense and attack model as a two-stage minmax game and analyze the optimal defense strategy. The proposed model is illustrated by a signaling system.

Therefore, the construction of lattice-based (H)IBE became one of the hot directions in recent years. In the setting of most existing lattice-based (H)IBE schemes, each bit of a user’s identity is always associated with a parameter matrix.

To overcome this issue, we propose a flexible trade-off mechanism between the size of the public parameters and the involved computational cost using the blocking technique. More specifically, we divide an identity into l′ segments and associate each segment with a matrix, while increasing the lattice modulo slightly for maintaining the same security level. As a result, for the setting of 160-bit identities, we show that the size of the public parameters can be reduced by almost 89.7% (resp. 93.8%) while increasing the computational cost by merely 5.2% (resp. 12.25%) when l′ is a set of 16 (resp. 8). Finally, our IBE scheme is extended to an HIBE scheme, and both of them are proved to achieve the indistinguishability of ciphertexts against adaptively chosen identity and chosen plaintext attack (IND-ID-CPA) in the standard model, assuming that the well-known ring learning with error (RLWE) problem over the involved ideal lattices is intractable, even in the post-quantum era. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, operation of power systems as bulk complex systems must be secured against transient instability not only in hourly optimal power flow studies, but also in daily unit scheduling. To address this challenge, in this paper, secure and economic operation of power system is ensured through a Transient Stability-Constrained Unit Commitment (TSCUC) model employing Benders Decomposition (BD) technique. The proposed TSCUC model consists of one master problem determining committed units and two distinct sub-problems verifying the steady state impacts of single outages, and transient stability criteria, respectively. This paper proposes a state transition formulation for master problem as a mixed integer linear programming optimization problem preserving both compactness and tightness of the problem. A structure-preserving transient stability assessment approach called cutset energy function method is developed to assess the transient stability of the system for each configuration of the committed units, under a set of probable contingencies. Several case studies on a dynamic test system are demonstrated to validate the efficacy of the proposed TSCUC algorithm. Finally, the proposed method performance is compared with the state-of-the-art methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,864

However, while migrating to the Cloud platform, a generic notion of their publicly available security policies make it challenging for clients to assess the security threats solely relevant to their applications. Additionally, traditional risk assessment techniques cannot address these challenges as they neither consider cloud security domains as assessment criteria nor identifies critical system resources that need to be protected in the likelihood of a successful attack. In order to address these challenges, this paper presents a risk assessment framework for clients’ applications that is characterized by the inclusion of cloud security metrics to perform risk assessment during the design phase of an application by incorporating the techniques of cloud misuse patterns. It also helps improve the security requirements phase that precedes risk assessment, by illustrating clients how different attack scenarios can spread through the applications by using the concepts of percolation centrality and probabilistic state transition diagrams. One of the key findings this work address is how to systematically gain a distinction between multiple system resources belonging to the same security defense priority level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,Journal of Information Security and Applications,865

RBA monitors additional features during login, and when observed feature values differ significantly from previously seen ones, users have to provide additional authentication factors such as a verification code. RBA has the potential to offer more usable authentication, but the usability and the security perceptions of RBA are not studied well. We present the results of a between-group lab study (n=65) to evaluate usability and security perceptions of two RBA variants, one 2FA variant, and password-only authentication. Our study shows with significant results that RBA is considered to be more usable than the studied 2FA variants, while it is perceived as more secure than password-only authentication in general and comparably secure to 2FA in a variety of application types. We also observed RBA usability problems and provide recommendations for mitigation.

The clutch is a key actuator for mode transition, but friction resulting from its use makes it difficult to achieve seamless mode transition. Moreover, as is usual in an electromechanical coupling system, the hybrid powertrain may exhibit complex dynamic behaviours as operating parameters change during mode transition. This paper considered changes in the clutch friction coefficient, and established a mathematical model of the hybrid powertrain in a parallel-series hybrid electric vehicle (PSHEV) during mode transition. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion and bifurcation theory are introduced to analyse the influence of speed difference on the dynamic characteristics of the hybrid powertrain, and the corresponding instability threshold were given. Furthermore, an optimised adaptive control methodology was proposed to control the dynamic behaviours, and tests on PSHEV were carried out. The results show that the variations of speed difference may lead to the occurrence of Fold and Hopf bifurcations, and that once the speed difference reaches the instability threshold, it may cause the system to enter a chaotic state and exhibit random oscillation. The proposed control methodology can effectively expand the security domain and suppress the oscillation to improve smoothness of mode transition. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Scopus,Vehicle System Dynamics,871

Secondly, the training contents should be timely updated, as cyber attacks constantly changing. At last, we should conduct training through effective and acceptable approach. We solved above three issues in this paper, and the innovative idea of this paper is constructing hierarchical concept map from the LOD database DBpedia. Then, we employ a series of processing on hierarchical concept map, including PageRank algorithm used to calculate the importance of each concept node, and filtering used to filtered out undefined and unrelated concepts. In particular, we get training contents from DBpedia dynamically and timely updated, so that training contents is keeping up to date.

The security metrics are developed to measure the dynamics of a network and a host state's information (e.g., IP address, port, software stacks, vulnerabilities, or network topology) introduced by various types of MTD techniques shuffling them. The key aspect of our proposed metrics is to capture variability that keeps track of changing patterns of the network and the host states upon every MTD triggering event. In this work, we propose the following security metrics capturing the variability based on the changes made by the MTD: (1) Network and host address-based metrics measuring variability of the network and host addresses based on a degree of uncertainty and unpredictability on the assigned IP address to the hosts in a network; (2) Attack path-based metrics measuring variability of attack paths using graphical models estimated based on the network state transitions from one topology to another topology upon triggering a network topology and/or IP shuffling MTD; and (3) Attack stage-based success metrics measuring the chances of discovering a vulnerable target host's information, exploiting the target host's vulnerability, and compromising the target host. Via extensive simulation study, we investigated the key parameters that can significantly affect the MTD performance based on the proposed security metrics. Our simulation results show that the metrics are viable to measure the effectiveness of deploying the MTD techniques. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,874

Network function virtualization enables flexible and inexpensive operation of network functions, by implementing virtual network functions (VNFs) as software in virtual machines (VMs) that run in commodity servers. However, VNFs are vulnerable to various faults such as software and hardware failures. Without efficient and effective fault tolerant mechanisms, the benefits of deploying VNFs in networks can be traded-off. In this paper, we investigate the problem of fault tolerant VNF placement in cloud networks, by proactively deploying VNFs in stand-by VM instances when necessary. It is challenging because VNFs are usually stateful. This means that stand-by instances require continuous state updates from active instances during their operation, and the fault tolerant methods need to carefully handle such states. Specifically, the placement of active/stand-by VNF instances, the request routing paths to active instances, and state transfer paths to stand-by instances need to be jointly considered. To tackle this challenge, we devise an efficient heuristic algorithm for the fault tolerant VNF placement. We also propose two bicriteria approximation algorithms with provable approximation ratios for the problem without compute or bandwidth constraints. We then consider the dynamic fault recovery problem given that some placed active instances of VNFs may go faulty, for which we propose an approximation algorithm that dynamically switches traffic processing from faulty VNFs to stand-by instances. Simulations with realistic settings show that our algorithms can significantly improve the request admission rate compared to conventional approaches. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm for the dynamic fault recovery problem in a real test-bed consisting of both physical and virtual switches, and results demonstrate that our algorithms have potentials of being applied in real scenarios. © 2019",Scopus,Computer Networks,876

Although antiviruses (AVs) are one of the main defensive solutions for most end-users and corporations, AV's evaluations are conducted by few organizations and often limited to compare detection rates. Moreover, other important factors of AVs’ operating mode (e.g., response time and detection regression) are usually underestimated. Ignoring such factors create an “understanding gap” on the effectiveness of AVs in actual scenarios, which we aim to bridge by presenting a broader characterization of current AVs’ modes of operation. In our characterization, we consider distinct file types, operating systems, datasets, and time frames. To do so, we daily collected samples from two distinct, representative malware sources and submitted them to the VirusTotal (VT) service for 30 consecutive days. In total, we considered 28,875 unique malware samples. For each day, we retrieved the submitted samples’ detection rates and assigned labels, resulting in more than 1M distinct VT submissions overall. Our experimental results show that: (i) phishing contexts are a challenge for all AVs, turning malicious Web pages detectors less effective than malicious files detectors; (ii) generic procedures are insufficient to ensure broad detection coverage, incurring in lower detection rates for particular datasets (e.g., country-specific) than for those with world-wide collected samples; (iii) detection rates are unstable since all AVs presented detection regression effects after scans in different time frames using the same dataset and (iv) AVs’ long response times in delivering new signatures/heuristics create a significant attack opportunity window within the first 30 days after we first identified a malicious binary. To address the effects of our findings, we propose six new metrics to evaluate the multiple aspects that impact the effectiveness of AVs. With them, we hope to assess corporate (and domestic) users to better evaluate the solutions that fit their needs more adequately. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,Computers and Security,877

In this paper, we propose a Security ontology-based modelling method for CMD systems (SOCMD), which uses ontology to represent DHR components and to define their inner relationships. SOCMD also connects information components including DHRs with security vulnerabilities, threats and attackers in cyberspace. Next, attacking rules, multi-mode arbitration mechanism and combination rules are designed with SOCMD for CMD systems and a new logical-checking method is proposed to make judgement about the security state of SOCMD. Finally, different use cases and performance tests are developed to demonstrate the application process for the model and to verify the validity of our method. © 2020 Chinese Institute of Electronics.

Using the fundamental frequency positive sequence fault components, the technique described in this paper does not require the user to know the fault phases and fault type in advance or use a line zero sequence parameter, which is not only difficult to obtain but is also affected by soil resistivity and thus may be variable. In addition, based on the fault components protection principle, the method is inherently unaffected by the operating state of the prefault system. Accurate transmission lines' fault location is important for expediting their repair or reducing outage times, so the proposed technique could improve the quality and security of the electricity supply.

In order to overcome this problem, we first introduce the novel conception of complete binary identity tree which is adopted to manage the qualified receivers. Then we design the prune-merge algorithm to further optimize the structure of the tree and cut down the amount of receivers. The algorithm effectively reduces the computation and storage cost of the trusted authority in the system. Subsequently, in virtue of composite-order bilinear groups, we bring forward an efficient public key broadcast encryption scheme combined its application to the system of data access control in cloud storage service. Compared with the existing schemes, the lengths of system public parameters, secret key and ciphertext in our scheme are all constant. In addition, the number of secret keys in our scheme increases logarithmically with the maximum amount of receivers, while the numbers of secret keys in the existing schemes increase linearly with the maximum amount of receivers. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is proved to guarantee adaptive security under general subgroup decision assumption in the standard model. The performance analysis manifests that our scheme is feasible for those broadcast applications with fixed senders. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,Soft Computing,880

With informed knowledge of a patient's history, physicians can make prompt clinical decisions for smarter, safer, and more efficient care. However, due to the privacy and high sensitivity of electronic health records (EHR), most EHR data sharing still happens through fax or mail due to the lack of systematic infrastructure support for secure, trustable health data sharing, which can also cause major delays in patient care. Objective: Our goal was to develop a system that will facilitate secure, trustable management, sharing, and aggregation of EHR data. Our patient-centric system allows patients to manage their own health records across multiple hospitals. The system will ensure patient privacy protection and guarantee security with respect to the requirements for health care data management, including the access control policy specified by the patient. Methods: We propose a permissioned blockchain-based system for EHR data sharing and integration. Each hospital will provide a blockchain node integrated with its own EHR system to form the blockchain network. A web-based interface will be used for patients and doctors to initiate EHR sharing transactions. We take a hybrid data management approach, where only management metadata will be stored on the chain. Actual EHR data, on the other hand, will be encrypted and stored off-chain in Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant cloud-based storage. The system uses public key infrastructure-based asymmetric encryption and digital signatures to secure shared EHR data. Results: In collaboration with Stony Brook University Hospital, we developed ACTION-EHR, a system for patient-centric, blockchain-based EHR data sharing and management for patient care, in particular radiation treatment for cancer. The prototype was built on Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source, permissioned blockchain framework. Data sharing transactions were implemented using chaincode and exposed as representational state transfer application programming interfaces used for the web portal for patients and users. The HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard was adopted to represent shared EHR data, making it easy to interface with hospital EHR systems and integrate a patient's EHR data. We tested the system in a distributed environment at Stony Brook University using deidentified patient data. Conclusions: We studied and developed the critical technology components to enable patient-centric, blockchain-based EHR sharing to support cancer care. The prototype demonstrated the feasibility of our approach as well as some of the major challenges. The next step will be a pilot study with health care providers in both the United States and Switzerland.

In order to achieve automatic driving, interconnection with the outside world, human-automatic system interaction, the security connotation of intelligent and connected vehicles (ICV) changes: Information security is the basis of its security. Functional safety ensures that the system is operating properly. Behavioral safety guarantees a secure interaction between people and vehicles. Passive security should not be weakened, but should be strengthened based on new constraints. In terms of information safety, the threshold for attacking cloud, pipe, and vehicle information should be raised to ensure that ICV system does not fail due to malicious attacks. The cloud is divided into three cloud platforms according to functions: ICVs private cloud, TSP cloud, public cloud. The transmission side classifies three APNs based on usage: Enterprise-owned APN, public network APN, and public network customized APN. The vehicle end ensures information security through the vehicle firewall, border firewall, PKI password system, key management, and security chip. In terms of functional safety, ICV function security needs to systematically consider factors such as vehicle, system and architecture. ISO 26262 design flow, AUTOSAR software architecture and perceptual information fusion are fully discussed in this section. In terms of behavioral safety, the driving mode change of the Level 3 ICV changes the driver's responsibility. Identify driving patterns to ensure that the driver can take over and clearly communicate driver responsibility as a prerequisite for safety. In the design and evaluation, it is necessary to consider the vehicle dimension, transition dimension and driver dimension to systematically guarantee vehicle behavior safety. In terms of passive safety, ICVs significantly reduce accidents. This can reduce some of the passive security configuration, but the reduction means integration rather than cancellation. New interior layout and constraints require the integration of passive safety and travel cabin. Active and safe sensors make passive safety intelligent. Passive safety is transformed into a combination of hardware and software In response to changes in the connotation of automotive safety of the ICV, a new research and development concept for enterprises covering six parts was proposed. A new research development architecture for enterprises covering four parts at the same time was proposed. © 2020 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.",Scopus,SAE Technical Papers,882

WSNs have applications in health care, home security, environment monitoring, etc., with research challenges in energy efficiency, network lifetime, and network reliability. One of the major research challenges lies in providing application-specific coverage of the region of interest and reliable transmission of the gathered data to the mobile sink in the presence of multi-state sensor nodes. To quantify such a capability, this paper proposes a quantitative measure, called Area Coverage Reliability (ACR) for WSNs. ACR brings together WSN reliability, area coverage, energy efficiency, mobility of data collector or sink, random duty cycle of nodes, and multi-state nature of sensor nodes under a common umbrella. This paper proposes a Monte Carlo simulation approach that utilizes an energy matrix to evaluate the effect of energy-depleted nodes and energy-oriented data transfer capability on ACR. The energy matrix reflects the residual energy of sensors, the energy required to transmit data to the neighboring nodes, connectivity, and the multi-state nature of the sensors. The proposed approach is illustrated through a series of random examples. The ACR information allows the network designers to achieve a better understanding of the impact of random duty cycle, node energy, node/link reliability, and randomly deployed sensors on reliability. © 2001-2012 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Sensors Journal,883

As a main bearer of current Mobile Networks, LTE/LTE-A carries massive and important business data but is facing more and more serious attack situations, which makes the Security Measurement over it become necessary and important. However, current methods are usually designed from specific malicious detections, which cannot provide the user with a synthetic view of security evaluation. Meanwhile, as the massive amount and poor quality of networking data are considered, the efficiency and accuracy of the current security measurement methods are usually not good. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation basis (the collecting data) of security measurement over LTE/LTE-A networks, and propose an Adaptive Security Data Collection and Composition Recognition (ASDCCR) method for it. We design heuristic algorithms and processing framework in ASDCCR to make the data collection adaptive and synthetic attack recognition become possible. We also verified the proposed method in simulated LTE environment of NS3 to verify the usability and accuracy of the proposed methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,888

The authors consider the upcoming generation of mobile networks, 5G, as a communication architecture for the IoT. The concept of adaptive security is adopted, which is based on adjusting the security level as per the changing context. It has the potential of reducing energy consumption by adapting security rather than always considering the worst case, which is energy consuming. The consideration of 5G introduces new dynamics that can be exploited to perform more adaptation. The proposed solution introduces an intelligence in the application of security, from the establishment phase to the use phase (end-to-end). The security level related to the used cryptographic algorithm/key is adapted for each node during the establishment phase, so to match with the duration of the provided services. A new strategy is formulated that considers both IoT and 5G characteristics. In addition, a solution based on the framework of the coalitional game is proposed in order to associate the deployed objects with the optimized security levels. Moreover, the application of security is also adapted during the use phase according to the threat level. Trust management is used to evaluate the threat level among the network nodes, while existing works focus on performing the adaptation during the use phase. The proposed approach achieves more adaptation through the consideration of both IoT and 5G dynamics.

Multiple solutions leveraging big data and machine-learning capabilities to detect Android malware are being constantly developed. Too often, these solutions are either limited to research output or remain isolated and incapable of reaching end users or malware researchers. An earlier work named PACE (Platform for Android Malware Classification and Performance Evaluation), was introduced as a unified solution to offer open and easy implementation access to several machine-learning-based Android malware detection techniques, that makes most of the research reproducible in this domain. The benefits of PACE are offered through three interfaces: Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API), Web Interface, and Android Debug Bridge (ADB) interface. These multiple interfaces enable users with different expertise such as IT administrators, security practitioners, malware researchers, etc. to use their offered services. In this paper, we propose PACER (Platform for Android Malware Classification, Performance Evaluation, and Threat Reporting), which extends PACE by adding threat intelligence and reporting functionality for the end-user device through the ADB interface.

This is especially true for dynamic security properties in the lineage of HRU safety. As a consequence, despite of their widespread use for policy specification and implementation, it is difficult to provide and preserve correctness guarantees for such models. We propose a formal framework called DRBAC, to resolve this dilemma: While retaining application-oriented model abstractions, our approach allows to configure their dynamics in terms of state transitions. This enables a security engineer to tailor both a model and its analysis method to certain safety-related analysis goals. We demonstrate this claim based on a practical security policy.

For instance, Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies offer low data rate communication over long distance, whereas Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN) technologies can reach higher data rates, but with a reduced range. For simple IoT applications, communication requirements can be fulfilled by a single technology. However, the requirements of more demanding IoT use cases can vary over time and with the type of data being exchanged. This is pushing the design towards multimodal approaches, where different wireless IoT technologies are combined and the most appropriate one is used as per the need. This paper considers the combination of Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as communication options for an IoT device that is running a Lightweight Machine to Machine/Constrained Application Protocol (LwM2M/CoAP) protocol stack. It analyses the challenges incurred by different protocol stack options, such as different transfer modes (IP versus non-IP), the use of Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) techniques, and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) security modes, and discusses the impact of handover between both communication technologies. A suitable end-to-end architecture for the targeted multimodal communication is presented. Using a prototype implementation of this architecture, an in-depth assessment of handover and its resulting latency is performed. © 2020 by the authors.

The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a widely applied open standard protocol for IoT networks. The RPL routing is highly vulnerable to routing attacks due to the constrained nodes. The attacks on the RPL aim to disrupt the optimal protocol structure and significantly deteriorating network performance. Secure RPL routing schemes attempt to derive a high-level abstract of RPL operations through network simulation traces and apply it as a reference to differentiate the malicious behavior. The RPL specifications include all the states and transitions with its corresponding statistics. However, the malicious activities around a node enforce it to initiate the unnecessary state transition, and thus, the legitimate nodes are equally treated as malicious in dynamic IoT network scenarios. Hence, this work proposes a game theoretic model based anomaly Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect the RPL attacks and verify and confirm their malicious activities. This study formulates the Game models based Anomaly Intrusion Detection System (GAIDS) for RPL security. The proposed approach consists of two interrelated formulations, such as a stochastic game for attack detection and evolutionary game for attack confirmation. The stochastic game model formulates the activities of the standard RPL rules as a zero-sum stochastic game. The stochastic game estimates the payoff by observing the states, transitions between them, and their statistics. However, there is a possibility to model legitimate players as malicious, due to the nature of RPL. Thus, the proposed GAIDS scheme implements the evolutionary game theoretic framework on clustered network topology for the attack verification. By synchronizing the results of the stochastic game of neighboring players, it differentiates the legitimate players from the suspected list successfully. As a result, the GAIDS isolates the detected attackers and maintains the routing performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the detection accuracy and throughput of the proposed gaming model based anomaly IDS is substantially high and outperforms the existing scheme. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,Wireless Personal Communications,894

To improve the cyber-security posture, it is important to develop effective methods for cyber-attack response and cyber-security risk assessment. In this research, we develop a finite-horizon semi-Markov general-sum game between the defender (i.e., plant operator) and the attacker to obtain the time-sensitive attack response strategy and the real-time risk assessment in nuclear power plants. We propose methods for identifying system states of concern to reduce the state space and for determining state transition probabilities by integrating Probabilistic Risk Assessment techniques. After a proper discretization of the developed continuous-time model, we use dynamic programming to derive the time-varying and state-dependent strategy of the defender based on the solution concept of the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. For risk assessment, three risk metrics are considered, and an exact analytical algorithm and a Monte Carlo simulation-based algorithm for obtaining the metrics are developed. Both players’ strategies and the risk metrics are illustrated using a digital feedwater control system used in pressurized water reactors. The results show that the proposed method can support plant operators in timely cyber-attack response and effective risk assessment, reduce the risk, and improve the resilience of nuclear power plants to malicious cyber-attacks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Scopus,Reliability Engineering and System Safety,895

In general, a smart terminal can be switched between the licensed modes (e.g. LTE) and the unlicensed modes (e.g. WiFi) according to user's demands (e.g. costs). The designed tradeoff is that the demands can be met by switching, but the security of wireless transmissions may be deteriorated, as the wireless communications can be overheard by the eavesdropper. The authors propose a transmission mode aware smart terminal scheduling (TM-STS) scheme to improve the security of wireless transmissions of a smart terminal.

Smart contracts provide a unique mechanism not only to create a unique one-of-a-type financial instrument, but also to enable unique innovations atop existing financial instruments due to underlying efficiencies. The smartness comes from the flexibility that programs provide which can create extremely unique financial instruments that are often complex to implement, yet easy to create, maintain through versioning, trade and destroy. The purpose of this paper is to describe the security token architecture as an application of smart contracts. Further, the author illustrates the implementation and design of a commonly used financial instrument known as Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) using the security token architecture proposed and smart contract functionality. The author then models the transaction using relational algebra, and, models the utility maximization. The author shows how on account of reduced information asymmetry between the investors and SAFE users (i.e. startups) utility is positive when smart contract-based security tokens are deployed for each state in the SAFE contract. Design/methodology/approach: Using an existing well-adopted instrument called a SAFE contract, the author illustrates the architecture of a smart contract-based security token system. The author illustrates how different components of a SAFE contract can be implemented as a smart contract and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of applying blockchain-based smart contracts to design SAFE instruments. The author deploys two methods: a state space diagram to explain state transitions and a utility model to explain the utilities. Findings: The key findings of this research study are the design of a security token architecture, which can be used to convert any the physical or contract-based financial instrument to a smart contract that runs on the blockchain. However, there are limitations to the implementation of the same which can be overcome. The model illustrates the positive utilities derived for all economic actors, i.e. the contractors, the utility providers, etc., in the market. Originality/value: This paper is an original paper.

Most of the existing FSM obfuscation strategies rely on additionally introduced set of obfuscation mode state-transitions to protect the original state-transitions of the FSM. Although these methods assume that it is difficult to extract the FSM behavior from the flattened gate-level netlist, some recent reverse engineering attacks could successfully break the defense of these schemes. The capability of differentiating obfuscation mode state-transitions from normal mode state-transitions makes these attacks powerful. As a countermeasure against these attacks, we propose a new strategy that offers a key-based obfuscation to each state-transition of the FSM. We use a special class of non-group additive cellular automata (CA), called D1 ∗ CA, and it's counterpart D1∗CAdual to obfuscate each state-transition of the FSM. Each state-transition has its own customized key, which must be configured correctly in order to get correct state-transition behavior from the synthesized FSM. A second layer of protection to the state-transition logic enhances the security of the proposed scheme. An in-depth security analysis of the proposed easily testable key-controlled FSM synthesis scheme demonstrates its ability to thwart the majority of the state-of-the-art attacks, such as FSM reverse engineering, SAT, and circuit unrolling attacks. Thus, the proposed scheme can be used for IP protection of the digital designs. Experimentations on various IWLS′93 benchmark FSM designs show that the average area, power, and delay overheads our proposed multi-bit key-based obfuscated FSM design are 56.43%, 6.87%, and 23.41% while considering the FSMs as standalone circuits. However, experimentation on the Amber23 processor core shows these overheads drastically reduce (reported area, power, and delay overheads values are 0.0025%, 0.44%, and 0%, respectively) while compared with respect to the entire design. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,Integration,898

Thus, people should be able to carry out their heavy computations without having the burden of purchasing expensive hardware and software. Cloud computing is an attractive solution to such needs, but the high energy consumption of physical machines in a Cloud data center is a matter of great concern. Therefore, some of the low-loaded machines can be turned off or switched into low energy mode using server consolidation approaches. In this paper, a Stochastic Process-Based Dynamic Server Consolidation (SB-DSC) policy is developed to reduce the total cost of data centers while satisfying the required quality of service. A novel algorithm, which we call it Stochastic Process-Based BFD (SBBFD), is employed in SB-DSC policy to perform virtual machine placements over time.

The unsupervised broadcast strategy allows malicious users (even though someone outside the system with the intentionally divulged public parameters) to distribute junk messages without responsibility. Consequently, content distributor authentication is essential for broadcast encryption systems to forbid spreading of junk information. In this work, we devise a solution for public key broadcast encryption system with adaptive security to resolve the aforementioned vicious broadcaster problem, which is neglected in the previous related works. In our scheme, any user could distribute an encryption of messages with both public parameters and his/her own secret keys, and each message is associated to its broadcaster. The construction is based on the composite order bilinear groups and its adaptive security depends on the hardness of the general subgroup decisional assumptions. Furthermore, this allows our scheme to be flexible in terms on the overhead of ciphertexts, which is constant sized. Compared with previous related broadcast encryption systems constructed in the composite order bilinear groups, our scheme inherits the superiority of adaptive security based non-interactive falsifiable assumption, and simultaneously achieves the optimal ciphertext overhead and the authentication of broadcasters. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,Multimedia Tools and Applications,900

BD requires several intelligent computation systems such as data mining and data analytics to handle BD-related storage challenges on a cloud. Presently, Cloud Computing (CC) is comprehensively used in the industry to handle BD challenges, but it raises various issues such as latency, security, and high cost for data management. The promising technology Fog Computing (FC) facilitates at the edge of a cloud to handle the aforementioned issues. The analytics on fog data generated by diverse IoT devices is one of the challenging tasks. In this chapter, we discourse on the complexity and uniqueness of Fog Data Analytics (FDA). A detailed discussion on FDA architecture is abstracted with the innovative process model. This chapter highlights the various attributes of the FDA for IoT applications and discusses the FDA classification like fog data collection, storage, and analytics on it.

Data information management is then realized via cloud computing, and an actual state-change trend and security assessment is provided. Finally, 4D technology (i.e., 3D model + time axis) that leverages a deformation chromatographic nephogram is used to facilitate managers to view deformation and safety of their underground spaces.

Then, an initial algorithm of state transition matrix was defined, observation vectors were extracted from the fusion of various system security detection data, the network state transition matrix was created and modified by the observation vectors, and a solution procedure of the hidden state probability distribution sequence based on extended hidden Markov model was derived.

Collision avoidance system (CAS) is one of the central concerns to provide security protection for autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a multi-mode collision avoidance system (mCAS), which combines a trajectory prediction module, a risk assessment module and a motion planning module into the closed-loop system. At each step, the trajectory prediction module predicts the trajectories of the vehicle and surrounding vehicles. The risk assessment model calculates the collision probability and chooses reasonable control mode. Then the motion planning module designs the desired deceleration profile based on it. The car takes the first step of the planned deceleration and repeats this cycle, achieving closed-loop control. The mCAS is tested in a closed-loop simulation setup and the results show that the proposed mCAS is of good effectiveness and feasibility, which can significantly reduce collision probability as well as false alarms.

In this paper, aiming at high security requirements of embedded software, a security modeling and verification framework of embedded software based on semi-formal and formal methods is proposed. An extensible security model ZMsec (Z-MARTE security model), which extends Z with elements of MARTE (Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded systems) and FSA (Finite State Automata), is presented to describe three dimensions of software: security usecases, static structures and dynamic behaviors. Further on, this paper designs ZMsecTL (ZMsecTemporal Logic) formulas to describe security properties, and proposes ZMCA (ZMsec Model Checking Algorithm), a security model checking algorithm on ZMsec model, to verify security properties in ZMsecTL formulas. In order to provide an intuitive state transition diagram for model checking, a depth-first ZMsecSD (ZMsecState Diagram) generation algorithm is designed. Drawing on the abstract framework, this paper develops a prototype implementation of ZMV (ZMsec Modeling and Verification tool), a tool for ZMsec integrated with modeling and verification phases.

Unlike existing systems, the system is heterogeneous in terms of information, communication, operation and hardware, architecturally using industrial Internet of Things solutions. Additionally, it is separated from the entity’s basic IT structure and based on the extensive use of parallel and distributed processing. In most of the available literature, improvements are sought in the way of wireless communication. In this work, the wired communication environment is examined, that is the backbone of any wireless sensor network. From the algorithmic point of view, it uses intelligent data analysis and biologically inspired methods. Communication environment is described using mainly graph theory, graph algebra and probability. The data collected by a heterogeneous group of autonomous traffic analyzers located at all levels of the communication hierarchy of the industrial information system is subjected to permanent analysis. Depending on the operating mode, the analyzers communicate with the central security node in one of three possible, complementary modes of transmission. Operating mode also determine how data is processed. In the simplest case it is carried out on the central node resources. On the other hand, in the most advanced one the system is in fact a parallel computer based on analyzers resources. The proposed architecture in the standard operating mode is integrated with the classic information system, in each of the emergency modes is separated from it. The work ends with the presentation of the empirical research results on the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Scopus,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,908

There is no infallible solution for protecting against ransomware as the malware code uses metamorphic and polymorphic algorithms to generate different versions thus evading signature detection. Ransomware also uses domain generator algorithms (DGA) to generate new domains for the command and control server (C&C), they constantly exploit new vulnerabilities, and they use various infection vectors. Thus, for an organization to protect itself, an adaptive security architecture is required to constantly monitor the network so as to detect new ransomware infection at an early stage such that it can be blocked before encryption of files occur. This approach is a defence in depth approach which supplements the network defences such as patch management, anti-virus software, intrusion detection, firewalls, and content filtering. A framework for the implementation of the adaptive security architecture model using open source software is presented and the proposed framework is tested against the WannaCry and Petya ransomware.

Information protection requires use of necessary physical, personal, information and communication technologies and above all - electromagnetic and cryptographic security measures. Equipment and tools for cryptographic protection should be examined and assessed in terms of resistance to known threats. Additional requirements are put on information protection for radio communication, especially military, where radio transmission is characterized by uncertainty of establishing and maintaining connections, bit rates are relatively low, often without full duplex. All this has an impact on the methods of cryptographic synchronization and implementation of cryptographic functions. A different approach to information protection is required by classic narrowband radio communications, a different one in time-division multi-access modes, and another one in broadband packet data transmission. Systems designed for information protection in radio communications implement appropriate operating modes of operation for cryptographic algorithms and protocols.

The attack objective is to degrade classification accuracy by covertly embedding malicious (labeled) samples into the training set. Such attacks can be mounted by an insider, through an outsourcing process (for data acquisition or training), or conceivably during active learning. In some cases, a very small amount of poisoning can result in dramatic reduction in classification accuracy. Data poisoning attacks are successful mainly because the malicious injected samples significantly skew the data distribution of the corrupted class. Such attack samples are generally data outliers and in principle separable from the clean samples. We propose a generalized, scalable, and dynamic data driven defense system that: 1) uses a mixture model both to well-fit the (potentially multi-modal) data and to give potential to isolate attack samples in a small subset of the mixture components; 2) performs hypothesis testing to decide both which components and which samples within those components are poisoned, with the identified poisoned ones purged from the training set. Our approaches addresses the attack scenario where adversarial samples are an unknown subset embedded in the initial training set, and can be used to perform data sanitization as a precursor to the training of any type of classifier. The promising results for experiments on the TREC05 spam corpus and Amazon reviews polarity dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our defense strategy. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),911

New nuclear power plant designs should consider safety parameters that maintain the operating conditions while coping with uncertain and possibly disruptive events. In other words, safety systems should increase the resilience of the nuclear power plants. In order to do so, resilience assessments must be carried out to study the system performance recovery once a disruptive event has occurred. The general process of resilience engineering comprises four states changing over time: reliability, unreliability, recovery and recovered steady-state. Probabilistic models like fault tree analysis, have been widely applied in the nuclear industry (among others) due to their flexibility to model complex engineering systems and uncertainty quantification of failure probabilities. However, such technique moderate the modeling scope when representing the interdependencies of the components in the system and variations in time over a disruption event. Moreover, additional complications in the resilience assessment process arise when considering the epistemic uncertainty due to the lack of knowledge about the events and the operating conditions. In this work, credal networks have been proposed for modeling complex interconnected systems as well as taking into account the epistemic uncertainty attached to the lack of data. The resilience assessment of the Main Heat Transport System together with key safety systems of an Advanced Thermal Reactor is carried out to evaluate the system recovery after a mishap adopting the credal network approach. The case study considers a heat removal system of a typical thermal reactor under high-pressure transients. This disruption event would activate the passive safety system to fulfill the reactor shut down process.

Our contributions are threefold:We exhibit a generic compiler taking any delayed-input Sigma protocol and returning a delayed-input Sigma protocol satisfying adaptive-input special honest-verifier zero knowledge (SHVZK). In case the initial Sigma protocol also satisfies adaptive-input special soundness, our compiler preserves this property.We revisit the recent paradigm by Canetti et al. (STOC 2019) for obtaining NIZK proof systems in the CRS model via the Fiat-Shamir transform applied to so-called trapdoor Sigma protocols, in the context of adaptive security. In particular, assuming correlation-intractable hash functions for all sparse relations, we prove that Fiat-Shamir NIZKs satisfy either: (i)Adaptive soundness (and non-adaptive zero knowledge), so long as the challenge is obtained by hashing both the prover’s first round and the instance being proven;(ii)Adaptive zero knowledge (and non-adaptive soundness), so long as the challenge is obtained by hashing only the prover’s first round, and further assuming that the initial trapdoor Sigma protocol satisfies adaptive-input SHVZK.We exhibit a generic compiler taking any Sigma protocol and returning a trapdoor Sigma protocol. Unfortunately, this transform does not preserve the delayed-input property of the initial Sigma protocol (if any). To complement this result, we also give yet another compiler taking any delayed-input trapdoor Sigma protocol and returning a delayed-input trapdoor Sigma protocol with adaptive-input SHVZK. An attractive feature of our first two compilers is that they allow obtaining efficient delayed-input Sigma protocols with adaptive security, and efficient Fiat-Shamir NIZKs with adaptive soundness (and non-adaptive zero knowledge) in the CRS model.

However, they are also met with some skepticism due to many impossibility results; goals such as commitments and zero-knowledge that are achievable in a stand-alone sense were shown to be unachievable composably (without a setup) since provably no efficient simulator exists. In particular, in the context of adaptive security, the so-called “simulator commitment problem” arises: once a party gets corrupted, an efficient simulator is unable to be consistent with its pre-corruption outputs. A natural question is whether such impossibility results are unavoidable or only artifacts of frameworks being too restrictive. In this work, we propose a novel type of composable security statement that evades the commitment problem. Our new type is able to express the composable guarantees of schemes that previously did not have a clear composable understanding. To this end, we leverage the concept of system specifications in the Constructive Cryptography framework, capturing the conjunction of several interval-wise guarantees, each specifying the guarantees between two events. We develop the required theory and present the corresponding new composition theorem. We present three applications of our theory. First, we show in the context of symmetric encryption with adaptive corruption how our notion naturally captures the expected confidentiality guarantee—the messages remain confidential until either party gets corrupted—and that it can be achieved by any standard semantically secure scheme (negating the need for non-committing encryption). Second, we present a composable formalization of (so far only known to be standalone secure) commitment protocols, which is instantiable without a trusted setup like a CRS. We show it to be sufficient for being used in coin tossing over the telephone, one of the early intuitive applications of commitments. Third, we reexamine a result by Hofheinz, Matt, and Maurer [Asiacrypt’15] implying that IND-ID-CPA security is not the right notion for identity-based encryption, unmasking this claim as an unnecessary framework artifact. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2020.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),915

If vulnerabilities are detected or even known, modes can be switched to reduce the attack surface and to minimize attackers’ range of activity. We propose to engineer CPSs with multi-modal software architectures to overcome the interval between the time when zero-day vulnerabilities become known and the time when corresponding updates become available. Thus, affected companies, operators and people will be able to protect themselves and their customers without having to wait for security updates.

Our main technical contribution is a novel proof strategy that allows us to tightly randomize user secret keys for identities with arbitrary hierarchy depths using low entropy hidden in a small and hierarchy-independent master public key. The notion of unbounded HIBE is proposed by Lewko and Waters (Eurocrypt 2011). In contrast to most HIBE schemes, an unbounded scheme does not require any maximum depth to be specified in the setup phase, and user secret keys or ciphertexts can be generated for identities of arbitrary depths with hierarchy-independent system parameters. While all the previous unbounded HIBE schemes have security loss that grows at least linearly in the number of user secret key queries, the security loss of our scheme is only dependent on the security parameter, even in the multi-challenge setting, where an adversary can ask for multiple challenge ciphertexts. We prove the adaptive security of our scheme based on the Matrix Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption in prime-order pairing groups, which generalizes a family of standard Diffie-Hellman assumptions such as k-Linear. © 2020, International Association for Cryptologic Research.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),918

To this end, this paper uniquely exploits active interaction on ICS-related ports and analysis of long-term multi-port traffic in a first attempt ever to capture and comprehend ICS automated attacks based on private protocols.

Originally created in 1967 as Aerial Measurement Operations, the Aerial Measuring System (AMS) mission has expanded to include acquiring baseline measurements, performing periodic site monitoring, and responding to radiological emergencies. In an accident scenario, AMS fixedwing and/or rotary-wing systems can be deployed to map radiological deposition. The aircraft are equipped to detect and measure radioactive contamination on the ground. The AMS has a sophisticated radiation detection system to gather radiological information and store it on the cloud using the Advanced Visualization and Integration of Data (AVID) platform or on local computers. This large amount of radiation monitoring data is later used to define and implement public protective guidance. Aerial radiation measurements have proven to be very effective in support of responses to nuclear or radiological emergencies resulting in the dispersal of radioactive material over a large area [viz. Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear power plant measurements done through March and April 2011] [1]. Right after the Fukushima accident, US aerial missions flew 85 flights over 500 hours, covering more than 10,000 square kilometres from the power plant to an 80 km radius to create a common operating picture of the extent of the gamma-emitting radionuclides and the footprint of the deposition from multiple releases. In order to be effective, the aerial measurements must be performed with a system that will collect the data in sufficient detail and quality to support the needs of emergency responders. This paper briefly outlines the technical specifications and functions of a system to be used on an aerial platform (airplane or helicopter) to measure widespread radioactive material (radioactive contamination). The information contained within this paper is intended to help ensure that measurements conducted by multiple AMSs are both technically compatible and comparable with each other and with measurements taken on the ground. Recently AMS has acquired newer and faster aircraft with longer-than-before ranges to deploy radiation monitoring equipment. This article defines and provides guidance for using the US DOE/NNSA's new aerial measurement platforms with multi-fold return of the investment in mind. The guidance involves technical innovation and optimized use of the platforms and collaboration with other stakeholders like the Department of Homeland Security, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The guidance recommends AMS to reposition itself as a valid and credentialed data provider to other relevant and recognized stakeholders in the area of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives threats. It recommends critical application expansion for AVID to analyse multi-modal data including hyperspectral, infrared, and radiological data through data fusion.  © 2020 COPYRIGHT SPIE.",Scopus,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,921

This challenge can be overcome at least partially by developing systematically risk-driven security objectives and controls for the target system, and determining how to offer sufficient evidence of its security performance via metrics. The target system of our investigation is an Android platform utilised for public safety and security mobile networks. We develop and analyse the security objectives and controls for these systems based on a technological risk analysis. In addition, we investigate how effective and efficient security metrics can be developed for the target system, and describe implementation details of enhanced security controls for authentication, authorisation, and integrity objectives. Our analysis includes implementation details of selected security controls and a discussion of their security effectiveness. It also includes conceptualisation and description of adaptive security for an Android platform which can improve the flexibility and effectiveness of these security controls and end-users confidence in service providers.

Although traditional encryption schemes can provide end-to-end encryption, users have to either share the same decryption keys or the data have to be stored in multiple instances which are encrypted with different keys. Both of these options are undesirable. However, KP-ABE can provide less key overhead compared to the traditional encryption schemes. While there are a lot of KP-ABE schemes, none of them simultaneously supports multiuse of attributes, adaptive security, monotone span programs, and static security assumption. Hence, we propose a fully secure KP-ABE scheme for monotone span programs in prime-order group. This scheme uses selective security proof techniques to obtain the requisite ingredients for full security proof. This strengthens the correlation between selective and full security models and enables the transition of the best qualities in selective security models to fully secure systems. The security proof is based on decisional linear assumption and three-party Diffie-Hellman assumption. © 2020 Isaac Amankona Obiri et al.

It is very important to estimate the occurrence probability of rare-events. The extended reachability graph of Control Logical Petri Net (CLPN), which provided a convenient way to express component failure, can be used to verify and estimate the reliability of the safety-critical system with Statistical Model Checking (SMC). However, one of the most important challenges that SMC method faces is the sample size grows too fast while the occurrence probability of rare-events tends to zero. This paper focuses on applying Importance Sampling (IS) on the extended reachability graph of CLPN. By adjusting the state transfer probabilities in the reachability graph, the model checking can be accelerated effectively. The main difficulty in IS is to devise the ideal biasing probability density. In this paper the cross-entropy is used for generating approximately optimal biasing probability density, and we apply an iterative method to accelerate the process. To demonstrate the presented approach, we compare the method based on IS with the traditional SMC method. The results show that the proposed method in this paper accelerates the model checking significantly, at the same time, the results of SMC method serve to validate the results of our approach. © 2013 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Access,927

Moving target defense, as an effective defense means, is constantly developing. It is difficult to effectively characterize an MTD attack and defense game with existing game models and effectively select the defense timing to balance SDN service quality and MTD decision-making benefits. From the hidden confrontation between the actual attack and defense sides, existing attack-defense scenarios are abstractly characterized and analyzed. Based on the APT attack process of the Cyber Kill Chain (CKC), a state transition model of the MTD attack surface based on the susceptible-infective-recuperative-malfunctioned (SIRM) infectious disease model is defined. An MTD attack-defense timing decision model based on the FlipIt game (FG-MTD) is constructed, which expands the static analysis in the traditional game to a dynamic continuous process. The Nash equilibrium of the proposed method is analyzed, and the optimal timing selection algorithm of the MTD is designed to provide decision support for the selection of MTD timing under moderate security. Finally, the application model is used to verify the model and method. Through numerical analysis, the timings of different types of attack-defense strategies are summarized. © 2020 Jing-lei Tan et al.",Scopus,Security and Communication Networks,928

This can result in a system being left insecure because of the lack of easily accessible experience and specialist resources. While performing security tasks, human experts often revert to a system's event logs to establish security information (configuration changes, errors, etc.). However, finding and exploiting knowledge from event logs is a challenging and time-consuming task for non-experts. Hence there is a strong need to provide mechanisms to make the process easier for security experts, as well as providing tools for those with significantly less security expertise. In this paper, we present a novel technique to process security event logs of a system that have been evaluated and configured by a security expert, extract key domain knowledge indicative of human decision making, and automatically apply acquired knowledge to previously unseen systems by non-experts to propose security improvements. The proposed solution utilises rule mining algorithms to extract security actions from event log entries. The set of identified rules is represented as a domain action model. The domain model and problem instance generated from a previously unseen system can then be used to produce a plan-of-action, which can be exploited by non-professionals to improve their system's security. Empirical analysis is subsequently performed on 21 event logs, where the acquired domain model and identified plans are discussed in terms of accuracy and performance. © 2019",Scopus,Journal of Information Security and Applications,930

Though the public cannot purchase their products, 88 of the top 100 arms producers use official corporate YouTube channels to reach the public. Their YouTube videos are political artefacts that these companies use to ‘sell’ national security as military security, framing the military as a ‘good, natural, and necessary’ part of society. Examining these videos reveals how this messaging can be conceptualized as a type of militarization because of the relation ‘good, natural, and necessary’ has to national security constructions. I use an intersectional lens and a multi-modal audio-visual approach to understand how images, sounds, and texts work together to tell a version of Sweden’s national security story as constructed in Saab’s official corporate YouTube videos. These videos illuminate a view that Sweden does (and should) have militarized national security that seems counter to images of a peacekeeping nation.

Existing models for assessing security have mostly assumed that different hazards causing the security breach are independent of each other. Dependencies however can exist among different hazardous actions and they may affect the system security attribute greatly. This paper advances the state of the art in quantitative security risk assessment by modeling one such dependency, where multiple sequence-dependent hazardous actions are performed to launch a successful security cyber-attack. Continuous-time Markov chain and semi-Markov process–based methods are proposed to estimate the occurrence probability of a security risk for systems undergoing the sequential cyber-attacks. While the CTMC method is limited to the exponential state transition time, the proposed semi-Markov process–based approach is applicable to analyzing attacks with any arbitrary types of transition time distributions. Both methods are illustrated using case studies where Trojan attacks in the banking application are modeled and analyzed. © 2019 The Authors.

Information security and privacy for WSN is particularly crucial. Cryptographic algorithms are extensively exploited in WSN applications to ensure the security. They are usually implemented in specific chips to achieve high data throughout with less computational resources. Cryptographic hardware should be rigidly tested to guarantee the correctness of encryption operation. Scan design improves significantly the test quality of chips and thus is widely used in semiconductor industry. Nevertheless, scan design provides a backdoor for attackers to deduce the cipher key of a cryptographic core. To protect the security of the cryptographic system we first present a secure scan architecture, in which an automatic test control circuitry is inserted to isolate the cipher key in test mode and clear the sensitive information at mode switching. Then, the weaknesses of this architecture are analyzed and an enhanced scheme using concept of test authorization is proposed. If the correct authorization key is applied within the specific time, the normal test can be performed. Otherwise, only secure scan test can be performed. The enhanced scan scheme ensures the security of cryptographic chips while remaining the advantages of scan design. © 2019 by the authors.

The need for built-in protection mechanisms, at all levels of design, is paramount to providing cost-effective, efficient, secure systems. In this work, Securely derived Finite State Machines (S∗FSM) and power-aware S∗FSM are proposed and studied. Overall results show that to provide an S∗FSM, the typical FSM requires a 50% increase in the number of states and a 57% increase in the number of product terms needed to define the state transitions. These increases translate to a minimum encoding space increase of 70%, raising the average encoding length from 4.8 bits to 7.9 bits. When factoring in relaxed structural constraints for power and space mitigation, the respective increases of 53 and 67% raise the average number of bits needed to 7.3 and 7.9. Regarding power savings, current minimisation is possible for both FSMs and S∗FSMs through the addition of encoding constraints with average current reductions of 30 and 70%, respectively. Overall, a power-constrained S∗FSM consumes about 5% more power than insecure FSMs with binary encodings, though with a penalty of a 95% increase in layout area. © 2019 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",Scopus,IET Computers and Digital Techniques,937

This work is aimed at creating a novel method of Augmented Reality Steganography (ARSteg). ARSteg uses cloud for image and key storage that does not alter any attributes of an image such as size and colour scheme. Unlike, traditional algorithms such as Least Significant Bit (LSB) which changes the attributes of images, our approach uses well established encryption algorithm such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption and decryption. This system is further secured by many alternative means such as honey potting, tracking and heuristic intrusion detection that ensure that the transmitted messages are completely secure and no intrusions are allowed. The intrusions are prevented by detecting them immediately and neutralizing them. © 2019 IEEE.",Scopus,"Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Communication and Electronics Systems, ICCES 2019",938

In theory this can potentially improve the security of the protocol when using the same number of exchange rounds, i.e. as there are more than two states the probability of an attacker guessing a response correctly is lower. Similarly, for the same security probability, multistate distance-bounding protocols require less rounds. On the other hand, transmission errors during the timed exchange phase of the distance-bounding protocol also impact on the security of the protocol, as the verifier needs to allow a certain acceptance threshold of incorrect responses. This threshold causes False Acceptance and False Rejection in protocols and further influences the security of the protocol. In this paper, we investigate the security implications of multistate channel implementation and symbol energy considering their effect on the acceptance threshold. We show that implementing multistate responses using simple Mary modulation methods found in contactless devices, does not necessarily provide the expected security improvement when devices have finite transmission energy to spend on challenge-response exchanges. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Scopus,Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security,942

Despite extensive advances in facial anti-spoofing based on single-model image, little work has been devoted to multi-modal anti-spoofing, which is however widely encountered in real-world scenarios. Following the recent progress, this paper mainly focuses on multi-modal face antispoofing and aims to solve the following two challenges: (1) how to effectively fuse multi-modal information; and (2) how to effectively learn distinguishable features despite single cross-entropy loss. We propose a novel Multi-modal Multi-layer Fusion Convolutional Neural Network (mmfCNN), which targets at finding a discriminative model for recognizing the subtle differences between live and spoof faces. The mmfCNN can fully use different information provided by diverse modalities, which is based on a weight-adaptation aggregation approach. Specifically, we utilize a multi-layer fusion model to further aggregate the features from different layers, which fuses the low-, mid- and high-level information from different modalities in a unified framework. Moreover, a novel Average Binary Center (ABC) loss is proposed to maximize the dissimilarity between the features of live and spoof faces, which helps to stabilize the training to generate a robust and discriminative model. Extensive experiments conducted on the CISIA-SURF and 3DMAD datasets verify the significance and generalization capability of the proposed method for the face anti-spoofing task.

Although recent studies have explored the quantification of system resilience, there has been limited research aimed at understanding the role of multiple performance measures, spatiotemporal heterogeneities, and modeling uncertainties within the assessment of resilience and associated decision-making. Under real-world conditions, there is an increased burden on analysts for translating observed system data (including human and electronic sensor observations) into system performance estimates that may not be directly observable. This paper addresses these issues using a scenario-based risk modeling approach to understand: (1) resilience of complex systems, often in cases of hidden (not readily observable) measures of performance, (2) resilience sensitivity to modeling uncertainties in event and system characteristics, and (3) resilience sensitivity to the measurement of performance across multiple operational perspectives. The methods in this paper integrate uncertainty-driven risk and probabilistic modeling within a multi-state Markov-based approach. This study contributes to the state-of-the-art by developing methodologies for assessing community perceptions of infrastructure system resilience using observable factors and inferring possibly hidden performance measures for facilitating adaptive decision-support. The methods are demonstrated with hypothetical spatiotemporal data across multiple system performance dimensions. The analysis results are useful for infrastructure security analysts, system decision-makers, and the general public. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Scopus,Journal of Risk Research,945

These 10 able-bodied subjects controlled the prosthetic arm and hand with electromyogram signals, while an artificial sensation of touch was conveyed to their arms as they operated the system, which enabled them to feel what the prosthetic hand was grasping as they were asked to transport an object from one location to another. This haptic feedback was provided in both the normal and abnormal operational modes but was disabled in the extremely abnormal mode. The electromyogram control signals for the arm were reversed in both the abnormal and extremely abnormal modes. Results from the simulated malicious attack on a prosthetic arm system showed that the subjects found the haptic feedback helpful in both the normal and abnormal modes of operation. Both the abnormal and extremely abnormal modes of operation negatively impacted the self-reported levels of trust, satisfaction, and frustration with the prosthetic system as the subjects grasped and transported an object.

Describing the approach that adversaries use to discover and exploit vulnerabilities to infiltrate software systems can help inform such an attacker mindset. Aims: Our goal is to assist developers and administrators in inculcating an attacker mindset by proposing an approach to codify attacker behavior in cybersecurity penetration testing competition. Method: We use an existing multimodal dataset of events captured during the 2018 National Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC'18) to characterize the approach a team of attackers used to discover and exploit vulnerabilities. Results: We collected 44 events to characterize the approach that one of the participating teams took to discover and exploit seven vulnerabilities. We used the MITRE ATTCK™ framework to codify the approach in terms of tactics and techniques. Conclusions: We show that characterizing attackers' campaign as a chronological sequence of MITRE ATTCK™ tactics and techniques is feasible.

When launching this kind of attacks, adversaries first compromise a fraction of the targeted system and then move laterally to the rest of the system until the whole system is infected. Various approaches were proposed to study and/or defend against lateral movement-based attacks. However, few of them studied transient behaviors of dynamic attacking and dynamic targeted systems. This paper aims to analyze the transient security of a dynamic network system under lateral movement-based attacks from the time that attack-related abnormity in the system is detected until mechanisms are designed and deployed to defend against attacks. We explore state-space modeling techniques to construct a survivability model for quantitative analysis. A phased piecewise constant approximation approach is also proposed to derive the formulas for calculating model state transient probabilities, with which we derive formulas for calculating metrics of interest.

However, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of the cloud platform environment, the performance of learning and predicting of cloud platform security state will be affected. Therefore, the method of this paper combined the internal security state and observable state of the cloud platform to construct the cloud platform security state transition model, and established a linear regression AdaBoost learning and predicting algorithm for the observation state of cloud platform. Then, based on the observable state learning and predicting results, the hidden Markov model was used to learn and predict the security state of the cloud platform, and calculated the probability trend of the internal security state of the cloud platform in the future. The experimental results showed that compared with HMM, the proposed method could predict the hidden security state probability in the next two time periods in advance, and the convergence time and job response time increased by about 16% and 1% respectively. © 2018 IEEE.",Scopus,"Proceedings - 2018 3rd International Conference on Smart City and Systems Engineering, ICSCSE 2018",952

These devices are designed to make life easier and more comfortable. Blockchain technology, especially its mass application, is becoming a term number one. Adoption of blockchain into enterprise networks still has a few challenges that need to be tackled. Utilizing blockchain can bring increased security and efficiency of network maintenance. The key feature of the blockchain, immutability, brings resistance to unauthorized modifications. The whole history of device configuration changes is stored in the blockchain, hence recovery after incidents is very straightforward. This paper extends our previous studies. We are introducing an improved architecture for management and monitoring of IoT devices using a private blockchain. The majority of the system is built on a chaincode, which handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as well as encryption and access control. Device configuration files are stored in the blockchain. When a modification occurs, the device downloads a new configuration in a simple manner. The chaincode receives notification whether setup was successful and this history is available for administrators. Our results show that such a system is possible and dissemination of configuration changes to IoT devices can be secured by the blockchain. The key novelty of our solution is a distributed management of configuration files of IoT devices in enterprise networks utilizing blockchain technology. This is essentially improving security and storage options for configurations in the blockchain. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Scopus,Sensors (Switzerland),953

With electrical generation sources in the United States changing under a wide range of pressures, the current fleet of nuclear power plants in the United States provides a reliable and sustainable source of electrical generation capacity.

While this produces many opportunities for increased efficiency, it introduces a new level of complexity for securing and reliably operating reactors in the presence cyber-threats. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission recently began urging stronger cybersecurity efforts at nuclear power plants. As upgrades at nuclear power plants begin, the implementation of digital instrumentation and control systems to monitor and run the power plant introduces new vulnerabilities that must be addressed. This necessitates a more modern discussion of risk. Within this context, we critically review past cyber-vulnerability incidents at nuclear installations and other critical facilities.

Adaptation of existing applications requires substantial implementation changes in individual architectural components. On the other hand, users may store their Personal Identifiable Information (PII) in the cloud environment so that cloud services may access and use it on demand. Even if cloud services specify their privacy policies, we cannot guarantee that they follow their policies and will not (accidentally) transfer PII to another party. In this paper, we present Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) as a trusted Identity and Access Management with two requirements: Firstly, IDaaS adapts trust between cloud services on demand. We move the trust relationship and identity propagation out of the application implementation and model them as a security topology. When the business comes up with a new e-commerce scenario, IDaaS uses the security topology to adapt a platform-specific security infrastructure for the given business scenario at runtime. Secondly, we protect the confidentiality of PII in federated security domains. We propose our Purpose-based Encryption to protect the disclosure of PII from intermediary entities in a business transaction and from untrusted hosts. Our solution is compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation and involves the least user interaction to prevent identity theft via the human link.

In natural wheelchair user and caretaker conversation a lot of distance related uncertain instructions like 'little' and 'far' will be used. With incorporating these uncertain terms, the interpretation of voice commands will be enhanced. In most existing systems, Joystick support is used as backup modality.

The singularity of the sybil attack is a sybil node that publish multiple identities of legitimate devices. It is highly essential to learn the behavior and predict possible actions of a sybil attacker while devising a defense mechanism for it. This paper provides a comprehensive characteristic analysis of sybil attack in IoT. Based on the nature of the task performed during this attack, it is classified into three phases as compromise, deployment, and launching phase. The compromise phase is modeled as an automaton with attacker state transition as a Markov chain model. A heuristic is also proposed for selection criteria of an attacker to compromise a node. In the deployment phase of the attack, an algorithm based on K -mean clustering is proposed to group compromised identities and deploy the sybil node for corresponding identities without violating the set of adjacent nodes. In the launching phase, the process of replacing sybil identities either over time or on detection is modeled using age replacement policy. The results depict that the proposed model effectively visualize the behavior of a sybil attacker in challenging environments of IoT. © 2014 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,959

The first perspective is that of the attacker who seeks to exploit vulnerabilities of the system to harm assets such as the software system itself or its users. The second perspective is that of the defender who seeks to protect the assets by minimising the likelihood of attacks on those assets. This chapter focuses on analysing security and privacy risks from these two perspectives considering both the software system and its uncertain environment including uncertain human behaviours. These risks are dynamically changing at runtime, making them even harder to analyse. To compute the range of these risks, we highlight how to alternate between the attacker and the defender perspectives as part of an iterative process. We then quantify the risk assessment as part of adaptive security and privacy mechanisms complementing the logic reasoning of qualitative risks in argumentation (Yu et al., J Syst Softw 106:102(replacement character)116, 2015).

Sensor networks based on IoT have strong Information transmission and processing capabilities. The security of sensor networks is progressively crucial. Cryptographic algorithms are widely used in sensor networks to guarantee security. Hardware implementations are preferred, since software implementations offer lower throughout and require more computational resources. Cryptographic chips should be tested in a manufacturing process and in the field to ensure their quality. As a widely used design-for-testability (DFT) technique, scan design can enhance the testability of the chips by improving the controllability and observability of the internal flip-flops. However, it may become a backdoor to leaking sensitive information related to the cipher key, and thus, threaten the security of a cryptographic chip. In this paper, a secure scan test architecture was proposed to resist scan-based noninvasive attacks on cryptographic chips with boundary scan design. Firstly, the proposed DFT architecture provides the scan chain reset mechanism by gating a mode-switching detection signal into reset input of scan cells. The contents of scan chains will be erased when the working mode is switched between test mode and functional mode, and thus, it can deter mode-switching based noninvasive attacks. Secondly, loading the secret key into scan chains of cryptographic chips is prohibited in the test mode. As a result, the test-mode-only scan attack can also be thwarted. On the other hand, shift operation under functional mode is disabled to overcome scan attack in the functional mode. The proposed secure scheme ensures the security of cryptographic chips for sensor networks with extremely low area penalty. © 2019 by the authors.

This paper is intended to examine existing approaches and challenges towards rethinking maintenance in the context of Industry 4.0 and thus contributes to the literature of production management and planning, by introducing a novel prescriptive maintenance model (PriMa). PriMa is comprising of four layers (i.e. data management, predictive data analytic toolbox, recommender and decision support dashboard as well as an overarching layer for semantic-based learning and reasoning). The integrated approach of PriMa enhances two functional capabilities, namely i) efficiently processing large amount of multi-modal and heterogeneous data collected from multidimensional data sources and ii) effectively generating decision support measures and recommendations for improving and optimising forthcoming maintenance plans correlated with production planning and control (PPC) systems. An industry-oriented proof-of-concept study has been conducted to explore the feasibility of applying PriMa in real production systems by implementing a decision support solution and achieving a significant reduction of downtime.

The network security is usually reflected by some relevant data that can be collected in a network system. By learning and analyzing such data, which are called security-related data, we can detect the intrusions to the network system and further measure its security level. Clearly, the first step of detecting network intrusions is to collect security-related data. However, in the context of 5G and big data, there are a number of challenges in collecting these data due to the heterogeneity of network and ever-growing amount of data. Therefore, traditional data collection methods cannot be applied in the next generation network systems directly, especially for security-related data. This paper presents the design and implementation of an adaptive security-related data collector based on network context in heterogeneous networks. The proposed collector solves the issue of heterogeneity of network system by designing a Security-related Data Description Language (SDDL) to instruct security related data collection in various networking contexts. It also applies adaptive sampling algorithms to reduce the amount of collected data. Furthermore, performance evaluation based on a prototype implementation shows the effectiveness of the adaptive security-related data collector in terms of a number of pre-defined design requirements. © 2018 The Author(s)",Scopus,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,967

Individuals and business organizations alike have continued to fall prey to ransomware where victims have been forced to pay cybercriminals even up to $1 million in a single attack whilst others have incurred losses in hundreds of millions of dollars. Clearly, ransomware is an emerging cyber threat to enterprise systems that can no longer be ignored. In this paper, we address the evolution of the ransomware and the associated paradigm shifts in attack structures narrowing down to the technical and economic impacts. We formulate an attack model applicable to cascaded network design structures common in enterprise systems. We model the security state of the ransomware attack process as transitions of a finite state machine where state transitions depict breaches of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. We propose a ransomware categorization framework that classifies the virulence of a given ransomware based on a proposed classification algorithm that is based on data deletion and file encryption attack structures. The categories that increase in severity from CAT1 to CAT5 classify the technical prowess and the overall effectiveness of potential ways of retaining the data without paying the ransom demand. We evaluate our modeling approach with a WannaCry attack use case and suggest mitigation strategies and recommend best practices based on these models. © 2019 MECS.",Scopus,International Journal of Computer Network and Information Security,968

Also, for security of data, encryption is also an important factor. However, in the case of encryption, overhead is generated, but encryption and overhead are always in a trade-off relationship in this way. In this paper, in order to reduce overhead of drone, the concept of reliability was applied. We applied low level security to drone with high reliability to reduce overhead and conversely applied high level security to drone with low reliability. In order to adjust the security level, adjust the size of Key used for encryption and reduce the weight of the security algorithm itself. The reliability of the drone was determined based on the number of times of receiving data and by applying group reliability through drone grouping, it was made possible to determine hierarchical reliability. Moreover, by storing the communication records of all drones in the blockchain, the integrity of the reliability is guaranteed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,969

The market is flooded with puzzles, games, quizzes or other kinds of applications destined to help teachers explain different concepts and to enable students to practice their skills and test the knowledge. For all these systems, be them computers, server or embedded devices, the internet connection is the essential aspect. As a result, we have children and students working with devices that are exposed to the highest degree of security issues and threats. Attacks are continuously evolving, becoming more flexible, adaptable and hard to detect, and leaving children and students vulnerable to malicious software that can either collect sensitive information about them or expose them to inappropriate content. Because of this, it is only natural that security solutions became of significant importance for the tech educational industry. Computers, servers and embedded devices are exposed to the highest degree of security issues and threats since the internet became an essential need. Attacks are continuously evolving, becoming more flexible, adaptable and hard to detect. This made only natural the shift towards adaptive security oriented solutions. One of the security those solutions is represented by anomaly based intrusion detection techniques. Anomaly based intrusion detection systems build a baseline of normal behavior. For a Linux based operating system, which represents a great percent of the platforms used in education, this is accomplished by monitoring a given process or sets of processes. Any significant deviation from the baseline model is flagged as malicious activity. This paper proposes a framework for intrusion detection using system call traces captured from services running on a container. The work done is based on The Australian Defence Force Academy Linux Dataset, better known as ADFA-LD. The analysis is done taking into consideration the temporal allocation of the system calls. The classification module is based on supervised machine learning techniques. To test the accuracy of the framework, a case study involving a database application running under a Linux container is analyzed.

In case of failure of a virtual machine, it is imperative to shift the processes running on this machine to another. This activity is known as live virtual machine migration and is classified under the major issues of research. Xia (2015) proposed a mathematical model to analyze this problem in which the work has been done in two phases. It is showing a state transition model system in which the M/M/1/K model has been utilized in phase1 to find the rejection probability of the jobs in the phase2. Each virtual machine is considered to have a buffer to store the incoming buffer. The major issue being discussed in this paper is the relation of the rejection probability of jobs with the changing size of the buffer. It actually provides an exhaustive analysis of three different queueing models, i.e., M/M/1/∞, M/M/∞, and M/M/1/K. The simulations are carried out in MATLAB, and the results are analyzed based on the rejection probability of the jobs. It is observed that with an increase in the request arrival rate, the rejection probability of jobs increases. However, with an increase in execution rate, the rejection probability of jobs decreases. If we change the model to M/M/∞, actually, the formulas of request rejection probability and job rejection probability got changed that resulted in a continuous decrease in values of rejection rate lines as compared to the values of the author. Hence, we can say that changing the queueing model is beneficial. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.",Scopus,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,973

Firstly, behavior of the attacker is described in-depth by the attack graph generated through MulVAL. Then, with the quantitative evaluation conducted by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, the nodes on the attack path can will be evaluated and the value will be further evaluated by the Bayesian model.

In this paper, a secure and high capacity data communication model is proposed to protect the transmitted data based on identical frames between a secret and cover data. In this model, the cover data does not convey any embedded data (as in normal steganography system) or modify the secret message (as in traditional cryptography techniques). Alternatively, the proposed model sends the positions of the cover frames that are identical with the secret frames to the receiver side in order to recover the secret message. One of the significant advantages of the proposed model is the size of the secret key message which is considerably larger than the cover size, it may be even hundred times larger. Accordingly, the experimental results demonstrate a superior performance in terms of the capacity rate as compared to the traditional steganography techniques. Moreover, it has an advantage in terms of the required bandwidth to send the data or the required memory for saving when compared to the steganography methods, which need a bandwidth or memory up to 3-5 times of the original secret message. Where the length of the secret key (positions of the identical frames) that should be sent to the receiver increases by only 25% from the original secret message. This model is suitable for applications with a high level of security, high capacity rate and less bandwidth of communication or low storage devices. © Czech Technical University in Prague, 2019.",Scopus,Acta Polytechnica,977

The combination of NB-IoT and WSNs can active the application of WSNs. In order to evaluate the influence of node heterogeneity on malware propagation in NB-IoT based Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks, we propose a node heterogeneity model based on node distribution and vulnerability differences, which can be used to analyze the availability of nodes. We then establish the node state transition model by epidemic theory and Markov chain. Further, we obtain the dynamic equations of the transition between nodes and the calculation formula of node availability. The simulation result is that when the degree of node is small and the node vulnerability function is a power function, the node availability is the highest; when the degree of node is large and the node vulnerability function satisfies the exponential function and the power function, the node availability is high. Therefore, when constructing a NBIOT-HWSNs network, node protection is implemented according to the degree of node, so that when the node vulnerability function satisfies the power function, all nodes can maintain high availability, thus making the entire network more stable. © 2019 Xiaojun Wu et al.",Scopus,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,978

Most broadcast encryption schemes do not provide anonymity, and the identities of target receivers are sent in plaintext. However, in several applications, the authorized users' identities have the same sensitivity as the broadcasted messages. Yu, Ren, and Lou (YRL) [Yu, S., Ren, K., and Lou, W.

This paper first proposed an attack on the YRL scheme, and showed that the unauthorized receivers could also decrypt the broadcasted message. Next, we proposed the Improved-YRL scheme and proved that it achieved anonymity and semantic security under adaptive corruptions in the chosen ciphertext setting. The proof is provided by the dual system encryption technique and is based on three complexity assumptions in composite order bilinear maps.

Cyber attacks, nevertheless, have shifted the attention to various other threats and damages. The attackers try to exploit vulnerabilities in networks and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, since these technologies are the integral part of the critical systems. Therefore, the vulnerability of Critical Infrastructure (CI) against cyber threats has led the need to devise modern security measures. Unavailability or failure of one CI can cause enormous devastation and damage to the society, economy and stability by provoking cascading failures to many other related infrastructures. Traditional security measures attempt to cater well-known emerging threats; however, strong and adaptive security measures/techniques are inevitable to defend against innovative attacks.

The principles guiding the design of such software have been mainly manifested by the service-oriented architecture (SOA) concept. In a SOA, applications are orchestrated by software services generally operated by distinct entities. Due to the latter fact, service security has been of importance in such systems ever since. A dominant protocol for implementing SOA-based systems is SOAP, which comes with a well-elaborated security framework. As an alternative to SOAP, the architectural style representational state transfer (REST) is gaining traction as a simple, lightweight and flexible guideline for designing distributed service systems that scale at large. This paper starts by introducing the basic constraints representing REST. Based on these foundations, the focus is afterwards drawn on the security needs of REST-based service systems. The limitations of transport-oriented protection means are emphasized and the demand for specific message-oriented safeguards is assessed. The paper then reviews the current activities in respect to REST-security and finds that the available schemes are mostly HTTP-centered and very heterogeneous. More importantly, all of the analyzed schemes contain vulnerabilities. The paper contributes a methodology on how to establish REST-security as a general security framework for protecting REST-based service systems of any kind by consistent and comprehensive protection means.

Each region is defined by a set of physical constraints that determine the sensing scope, e.g., based on device position or other environmental variables, plus a set of periodic tasks that perform the actual sensing. The resulting behavior is inherently dynamic: as a device's state changes, e.g., moves in space, it enters and/or leaves different regions, thereby changing the set of active tasks; moreover, regions can be added, deleted, and reprogrammed on-the-fly. Flux makes use of a domain-specific language for sensing tasks that is compiled into abstract bytecode, later executed by a low-footprint virtual machine within a device, guaranteeing runtime safety by construction. For region/task dissemination, Flux employs a broker that holds a changeable region configuration plus gateways that mirror the configuration throughout different network access points to which devices connect. Sensing data is streamed by devices to gateways and then back to the broker. Live or archived data streams are in turn fed by the broker to data-processing clients, which interface with the broker using a publish/subscribe API. We conducted two case-study experiments illustrating Flux: a single-region deployment to monitor WiFi signal quality, and a multi-region deployment to monitor noise, temperature, and places-of-interest based on device movement. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Scopus,ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks,991

In this paper, two semi-Markov decision process (SMDP)-based coordinated virtual machine (VM) allocation methods are proposed to balance the tradeoff between the high cost of providing services by the remote cloud and the limited computing capacity of the local fog. We first present a model-based planning method in which it is necessary to train the state transition probabilities and the expected time intervals between adjacent decision epochs. To facilitate training them, the SMDP is degraded into a continuous-time Markov decision process (CTMDP) in which the service requests and ongoing service completions follow a continuous-time Markov chain. The relative value iterative algorithm for the CTMDP is used to find an asymptotically optimal VM allocation policy. In addition, we also propose a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) method, where an optimal coordinated VM allocation policy is approximated by learning from the states and rewards of feedback. The simulation results show that the performance of the model-free RL method can converge to a level similar to that of the model-based planning method and outperform the greedy VM allocation method. © 2014 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,992

Collaborative security exploits the capabilities of these connected devices and opportunistically composes them to protect assets from potential harm. By dynamically composing these capabilities, collaborative security implements the security controls that satisfy both security and non-security requirements. However, this dynamic composition is often hampered by the heterogeneity of the devices available in the environment and the diversity of their behaviours. In this article, we present a systematic, tool-supported approach for collaborative security where the analysis of requirements drives the opportunistic composition of capabilities to realise the appropriate security control in the operating environment. This opportunistic composition is supported through a combination of feature modelling and mediator synthesis. We use features and transition systems to represent and reason about capabilities and requirements. We formulate the selection of the optimal set of features to implement adequate security control as a multi-objective constrained optimisation problem and use constraint programming to solve it efficiently. The selected features are then used to scope the behaviours of the capabilities and thereby restrict the state space for synthesising the appropriate mediator. The synthesised mediator coordinates the behaviours of the capabilities to satisfy the behaviour specified by the security control. Our approach ensures that the implemented security controls are the optimal ones, given the capabilities available in the operating environment. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by implementing a feature-driven mediation for collaborative security tool and applying it to a collaborative robots case study. © 2018 ACM.",Scopus,ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems,993

The synthesis tool implements deterministic FSM by adding extra don’t care states/transitions during optimization. This additional insertion makes the FSM vulnerable to setup-time violation based fault injection (STVFI) and hardware Trojan attacks. The existing techniques are inefficient to completely mitigate these vulnerabilities and exhibit significant design overhead. Therefore, this paper presents a novel lightweight secure machine design technique that completely mitigates the vulnerabilities with minimum overhead. The paper first proposes a new metric to identify all types of vulnerable transitions (VTs) followed by a trustworthy FSM design algorithm and efficient vulnerability mitigation architecture (EVMA). Though our EVMA completely alleviates the vulnerabilities to STVFI and Trojan attacks, it slightly increases the overhead due to additional multiplexers. Hence, we also propose new secure FSM design algorithm and two new lightweight vulnerability mitigation architectures (LVMA-I and LIVMA-II) that control the FFs using existing clear and/or preset pins instead of multiplexers. The experimental results on AES and RSA encryption modules show that the proposed technique detects 100% VTs. Further, ASIC and FPGA implementation of the proposed LIVMA-II using Cadence RTL and Xilinx Vivado presents on an average 40%, 59.6%, and 51.1% reduced area, power and delay respectively compared to the well-known technique. Due to negligible design overhead, our technique is best suitable for designing secure controller of portable IoT devices. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,Journal of Electronic Testing: Theory and Applications (JETTA),994

Graphical security models (e.g., Attack Graphs and Attack Trees) are widely used to systematically analyse the security posture of network systems using security metrics. However, there are problems using them to assess the security of dynamic networks. First, most models are unable to capture dynamic changes occurring in the networks over time. Second, the existing security metrics are not designed for the analysis of dynamic networks and hence their effectiveness to the dynamic changes in the network still remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically categorise network changes into two categories (i.e., changes in hosts and changes in edges). We conduct a comprehensive analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of security metrics using a Temporal Hierarchical Attack Representation Model, which can capture and analyse the changes in the security of network systems. Further, we investigate the varying effects of security metrics when changes are observed in the dynamic networks. Our simulation results show that different security metrics (except the shortest attack path) have varying security posture changes with respect to changes in the network (when we introduce time to them). However, none of the security metrics consistently changes for all the network changes that we observe in our scenarios. Hence, the results provide some insights into what security metrics can change (accordingly) when a particular network change is observed.

In the future, most of the homes will be equipped with sensing and interaction services which would be used for monitoring, controlling and alarming giving users a new and a different experience. The aim of introducing smart technology in houses is for providing a better quality living to the residents by the integrating technology and services. These smart applications focus on safety, security, care and comfort while this paper focuses on comfort. One of the major issues today is to having many items in the kitchen but not knowing what to cook. This paper mainly addresses this issue by suggesting the appropriate recipes according to the food items present in the kitchen. Each food item is tagged using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tag and is scanned using a RFID card reader. Based on the items scanned this application suggests a list of recipes that can be cooked from the food items available at that particular point of time. Design of Application Programming Interfaces (API) helps in reusability of modules across various applications. APIs minimize the need to understand every detail of the component that forms a building block by means of abstraction. The proposed paper is API centric since most of the functionality is accomplished through API calls thus realizing complete abstraction. The interaction between APIs is achieved through RESTful web services. Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style which runs over HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol) provides light weight communication and when web services use REST architecture they are called RESTful APIs. Another reason for using RESTful web services is that they are stateless and hence easily scalable. The flexibility of REST makes it extremely useful in providing consumer need specific message payloads and also assigning resources their Universal Resource Identifier (URI). Therefore, the proposed paper aims to develop APIs for smart kitchen enabling easy extensibility to other similar applications like smart health. © 2018 IEEE.",Scopus,"2nd International Conference on Computer, Communication, and Signal Processing: Special Focus on Technology and Innovation for Smart Environment, ICCCSP 2018",999

Therefore, a trade-off between risk mitigation actions and network performance can be perceived as a major performance objective.

For instance, the probabilistic verification of the long-run behavior of a safety-critical system enables assessors to check whether it accepts a human abortcommand at any time with a probability that is sufficiently high. The stochastic system is represented as probabilistic model, a long-run property is asserted and a probabilistic verifier checks the model against the property. However, existing probabilistic verifiers do not account for the imprecision of the probabilistic parameters in the model. Due to uncertainty, the probability of any state transition may be subject to small perturbations which can have direct consequences for the veracity of the verification result. In reality, the safety-critical system may accept the abort-command with an insufficient probability. In this paper, we introduce the first probabilistic verification technique that accounts for uncertainty on the verification of longrun properties of a stochastic system. We present a mathematical framework for the asymptotic analysis of the stationary distribution of a discrete-time Markov chain, making no assumptions about the distribution of the perturbations. Concretely, our novel technique computes upper and lower bounds on the long-run probability, given a certain degree of uncertainty about the stochastic system. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Scopus,ESEC/FSE 2018 - Proceedings of the 2018 26th ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering,1001

Cybercriminals have adapted their methods to circumvent traditional defences and hide undetected on systems for months or even years.

A balanced blending of direct and recommendation trust are done with trust weights to make them relevant to current application scenarios.

Web service technology defines several supporting protocols and specifications such as SOAP and WSDL for communication with client and server for data interchange. A new architectural paradigm has emerged in SOA in recent years called REpresentational State Transfer (REST) that is also used to integrate loosely coupled service components, named RESTful web services, by system integration consortiums. This SOA implementation does not possess adequate security solutions within it, and its security is completely dependent on network/transport layer security that is obsolete owing to latest web technologies such as Web 2.0 and its upgraded version, Web 3.0. Vendor security products have major implementation constraints such as they need secured organizational environment and breach to SOA specifications, hence introducing new vulnerabilities. Herein, we examine the security vulnerabilities of RESTful web services in the view of popular OWASP rating methodologies and analyze the gaps in the existing security solutions. We hence propose an adaptive security solution for REST that uses public key infrastructure techniques to enhance the security architecture. The proposed security architecture is constructed as an adaptive way-forward Internet-of-Things (IoT) friendly security solution that is comprised of three cyclic parts: learn, predict and prevent. A novel security component named “intelligent security engine” is introduced which learns the possible occurrences of security threats on SOA using artificial neural networks learning algorithms, then it predicts the potential attacks on SOA based on obtained results by the developed theoretical security model, and the written algorithms as part of security solution prevent the SOA attacks.

An intrusion tolerance model based on multiple recovery mechanisms is introduced in this paper and how to quantify the security attributes of the model is proposed. A state transition model with recovery states more accurately describes the dynamic behavior of the system. Considering that recovery mechanisms have a great impact on the security performance of the system, we set up the cost models corresponding to different recovery mechanisms. We propose a feasible security measure based on mean cost to security failure in order to evaluate the system cost during the recovery phase.

Collaborative robots may offer a solution; however, these systems only comply with safety standards if operating at reduced speeds. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and implementation of a novel security system that allows human–robot coexistence while permitting the robot to execute much of its task at nominal speed. Design/methodology/approach: The security system is defined by three modes: a nominal mode, a coexistence mode and a gravity compensation mode. Mode transition is triggered by three lasers, two of which are mechanically linked to the robot. These scanners create a dynamic envelope around the robot and allow the detection of operator presence or environmental changes. To avoid velocity discontinuities between transitions, the authors propose a novel time scaling method. Findings: The paper describes the system’s mechanical, software and control architecture. The system is demonstrated experimentally on a collaborative robot and is compared with the performance of a state-of-art security system. Both a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the new system is carried out. Practical implications: The mode transition method is easily implemented, requires little computing power and leaves the trajectories unchanged. As velocity discontinuities are avoided, motor wear is reduced. The execution time is substantially less than a commercial alternative. These advantages can lead to economic benefits in high-volume manufacturing environments. Originality/value: This paper proposes a novel system that is based on industrial material but can generate dynamic safety zones for a collaborative robot. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Scopus,Industrial Robot,1008

Revocable hierarchical identity-based encryption (RHIBE) has attracted a lot of attention in recent years, many RHIBE schemes have been proposed but shown to be either insecure or bounded where they have to fix the maximum hierarchical depth of RHIBE at setup. In this paper, we propose a new unbounded RHIBE scheme with decryption key exposure resilience and with short public system parameters, and prove our RHIBE scheme to be adaptively secure. Our system model is scalable inherently to accommodate more levels of user adaptively with no adding workload or restarting the system. By carefully designing the hybrid games, we overcome the subtle obstacle in applying the dual system encryption methodology for the unbounded and revocable HIBE.

Nevertheless, conventional VM migration approaches induce significant extra storage and network traffic to the source server that is already heavily loaded or scheduled for upgrade or repair. As a result, both the VM performance perceived by the application/user and the migration performance are degraded significantly. In this paper, we aim to address this problem by proposing a novel scheme, called SnapMig, to improve the VM live storage migration efficiency and eliminate its performance impact on user applications at the source server by effectively leveraging the existing VM snapshots in backup servers. By outsourcing the task of transferring VM base image and snapshots to the destination server to backup servers, the source server only needs to migrate the latest state changes to the destination server, leading to simultaneous improvement on VM performance, migration time and multiple-VM migration efficiency. Our lightweight prototype implementation of the SnapMig scheme demonstrates that, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, SnagMig can significantly reduce the migration time and improve the source-server VM performance at the same time. Moreover, the performance improvement provided by SnapMig becomes much more pronounced with multiple concurrent VM migrations. © 1990-2012 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,1012

In this context, Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a promising network layer technology that is used for a secure, reliable and remote access to patient health information. It is an overlay network that creates secure and dynamic tunnels between various devices across a public network such as the Internet. However, it is vulnerable to several attacks such as spoofing, snipping, and hacking as the data is transmitted through the Internet connection. In addition, due to the IoT device's energy constraints and the application requirements, the main purpose is to adaptively select the most appropriate encryption and authentication algorithms to secure the communication tunnel between these resource constrained devices and the remote user. Therefore, adaptive risk-aware secure tunnel negotiation is perceived as a major performance objective.

Attackers chain together these vulnerabilities for effective attack path traversal in a given attack. The challenge has not been in identifying the vulnerable components but in capturing the dependencies amongst the vulnerabilities and statistically evaluating the effect exerted by one vulnerability unto another. In this paper, we capture the dependencies between vulnerabilities in hypervisor networks by aggregating incoming attack edges via disjunction and conjunction of attack events in the resultant Bayesian attack network. We illustrate the use of local conditional probabilities distributions at a given node to evaluate the likelihood of node exploitation for attack propagation under varying conditions. We further identify critical nodes and edges without which a given attack will not materialize and show how a security analyst can use such in the security mitigation process.

There have been extensive efforts in government, academia, and industry to anticipate, forecast, and mitigate such cyberattacks. A common approach is time-series forecasting of cyberattacks based on data from network telescopes, honeypots, and automated intrusion detection/prevention systems. This research has uncovered key insights such as systematicity in cyberattacks. Here, we propose an alternate perspective of this problem by performing forecasting of attacks that are “analyst-detected” and “-verified” occurrences of malware. We call these instances of malware cyber event data. Specifically, our dataset was analyst-detected incidents from a large operational Computer Security Service Provider (CSSP) for the US Department of Defense, which rarely relies only on automated systems. Our data set consists of weekly counts of cyber events over approximately 7 years. This curated dataset has characteristics that distinguish it from most datasets used in prior research on cyberattacks. Since all cyber events were validated by analysts, our dataset is unlikely to have false positives which are often endemic in other sources of data. Further, the higher-quality data could be used for a number of important tasks for CSSPs such as resource allocation, estimation of security resources, and the development of effective risk-management strategies. To quantify bursts, we used a Markov model of state transitions. For forecasting, we used a Bayesian State Space Model and found that events one week ahead could be predicted with reasonable accuracy, with the exception of bursts. Our findings of systematicity in analyst-detected cyberattacks are consistent with previous work using cyberattack data from other sources. The advanced information provided by a forecast may help with threat awareness by providing a probable value and range for future cyber events one week ahead, similar to a weather forecast. Other potential applications for cyber event forecasting include proactive allocation of resources and capabilities for cyber defense (e.g., analyst staffing and sensor configuration) in CSSPs. Enhanced threat awareness may improve cybersecurity by helping to optimize human and technical capabilities for cyber defense. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

Wireless body area network (WBAN) is a highly suitable communication tool for the medical IoT devices. However, the conception of WBAN applications is still a challenging job that should take into consideration many technical requirements such as network lifetime, security level, network throughput and data criticality and prioritization. As a consequence, a trade-off between security effectiveness, energy efficiency, and QoS requirements can be perceived as a major performance objective. In this paper, we propose a stochastic game to balance the tradeoff between network performance and security level while taking into account the context dynamics. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve an acceptable security level and is more efficient than benchmark algorithms in terms of network lifetime and throughput. © 2018 IEEE.",Scopus,CCNC 2018 - 2018 15th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications and Networking Conference,1020

The VTPAC is a force multiplier that allows users to gain valuable teach pendant experience in labs with few robots, and makes the actual real-world robot time more valuable. It is also like a graduated driver's license where the student must prove some proficiency with the VTPAC before being allowed to get behind the wheel. The VTPAC will be used to operate the real robot system too and will allow people to be trained without using real robotic systems in very safe environment. The VTPAC can be used for industrial training and can be integrated in the academic programs, especially for online courses. In this research, the Fanuc LR Mate 200iC robot and the Visual Components software have been selected as a case study. These choices were made because of the easy access to the Fanuc LR Mate 200iC and this interface by reason of it can control the robot the same way as the Teach Pendant in the real world. Using the robot kinematic theory to understand the Teach Pendant commands, the code was developed suchthat it respects the operating mode of the robot and all the security operations needed. For the VTPAC development we used Python to communicate with the Visual Components software to work as a client for the software. This can allow users to utilize its own cellphone as the teach pendant and the software as the robot, having a more real experience in a safe environment.

Stealthy malware has become an emerging challenge to Android security as it can remain undetected for quite a long time. However, traditional defense techniques are insufficient in face of this new threat. Our in-depth study on published malware analysis reports and corresponding code analysis leads to three key observations: 1) a stealthy attack goes through multiple states; 2) state transitions are caused by a sequence of attack actions; 3) an attack action typically involves several Android APIs on different objects. These insights motivate us to design a two-layer finite state machine (FSM) model, named StateDroid, to depict multi-step stealthy attacks in terms of state transitions. Our goal is to reason about various stealthy attacks from an Android app in one pass. However, the heterogeneous characteristics of attack actions make automatic construction of accurate detection model a challenging work. To overcome this obstacle, StateDroid abstracts the semantics of Android APIs and attacks as Horn clauses, and then it automatically constructs the two-layer FSM model via Horn-clause verification. We have developed an open-source prototype of StateDroid and evaluated it extensively with ground truth dataset, 1, 505 Google Play apps, and 1, 369 malicious apps, respectively. The encouraging experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of StateDroid. Our study shows stealthy attacks have been quite common among new-generation malware such as notorious ransomware, and we even identify 7.5% of recent Google Play apps exhibit unexpected stealthy behaviors.  © 2018 ACM.",Scopus,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,1022

For example, in a smart-home project, a set of spatiotemporal pattern learning automata are used to monitor a user's repetitive activities, by which the home's automaticity can be promoted while some of his/her burdens can be reduced. Existing algorithms for spatiotemporal event pattern recognition in dynamic noisy environment are based on fixed structure stochastic automata whose state transition function is fixed and predesigned to guarantee their immunity to noise. However, such design is conservative because it needs continuous and identical feedbacks to converge, thus leading to its very low convergence rate. In many real-life applications, such as ambient assisted living, consecutive nonoccurrences of an elder resident's routine activities should be treated with an alert as quickly as possible. On the other hand, no alert should be output even for some occurrences in order to diminish the effects caused by noise. Clearly, confronting a pattern's change, slow speed and low accuracy may degrade a user's life security. This paper proposes a fast and accurate leaning automaton based on variable structure stochastic automata to satisfy the realistic requirements for both speed and accuracy. Bias toward alert is necessary for elder residents while the existing method can only support the bias toward 'no alert.' This paper introduces a method to allow bias toward alert or no alert to meet a user's specific bias requirement.

Once a user of the entity signs-on for a service, she can access all services available to her. This is known as single sign-on (SSO). For implementation of SSO, user authentication is separated, at least logically, from services. An identity provider (IDP) authenticates a user and a service provider (SP) delivers each service. Thus, a user has an active IDP session, and one active service session for each SP she is accessing. While SSO eases the life of users and system-administrators, if SSO not implemented carefully, a user may sign-out from all services but still may have an active IDP session, and users might not be aware of existence of the active IDP sessions. In this work, we use state-transition diagrams to trace the steps during a SSO activity, and then show the states that a user’s browser may maintain. We show that even after a user signs-out or timed-out from all service sessions or the IDP server session, active sessions may exist that the user maybe unaware of. This situation may happen because implementer never thought of this possibility or the user is unaware of such possibility or both.

FSA are also widely used in network security [6], bioinformatics [4] to enable efficient pattern matching. Compute-centric architectures like CPUs and GPG-PUs perform poorly on automata processing due to ir-regular memory accesses and can process only few state transitions every cycle due to memory bandwidth limitations. On the other hand, memory-centric architectures such as the DRAM-based Micron Automata Processor (AP) [2] can process up to 48K state transitions in a single cycle due to massive bit-level parallelism and reduced data movement/instruction processing overheads. Micron Automata Processor: The Micron AP re-purposes DRAM columns to store FSM states and the row address to stream input symbols. It implements homogeneous non-deterministic finite state automata (NFA), where each state has incoming transitions only on one input symbol. Each state has a label, which is the one-hot encoding of the symbols it is required to match against. Each input symbol is processed in two phases: (1) state-match, where the states whose label matches the input symbol are determined and (2) state-transition, where each of the matched states activates their corresponding next states. We explore SRAM-based last-level caches (LLCs) as a substrate for automata processing that are faster and integrated on processor dies. Cache capacity: One immediate concern is whether caches can store large automata. Interestingly, we observe that AP sacrifices a huge fraction of die area to accommodate the routing matrix and other non-memory components required for automata processing and only has a packing density comparable to caches. Repurposing caches for automata processing: While the memory technology benefits of moving to SRAM are apparent, repurposing the 40-60% passive LLC die area for massively parallel automata computation comes with several challenges. Processing an input symbol every LLC access (∼20-30 cycles @ 4GHz), would lead to an operating frequency comparable to DRAM-based AP (∼200 MHz), negating the memory technology benefits. Increasing operating frequency further can be made possible only by architecting an (1) in-situ computation model which is cognizant of internal geometry of LLC slices, and (2) accelerating state-match (array read) and state-transition (switch+wire propagation delay) phases of symbol processing. Accelerating state-match: This is challenging because industrial LLC subarrays typically have 4-8 bitlines sharing a sense-amp. This means that only 1 out of 4-8 states stored can match every cycle leading to gross under-utilization and loss of parallelism. To solve this, we leverage sense-amp cycling techniques that exploit spatial locality of state-matches. Accelerating state-transition: Accelerating state-transition at low-area cost requires the design of a scalable interconnect that efficiently encodes and supports multiple state-transitions on the same cycle, often to the same destination state. We observe that a 8T SRAM memory array can be re-purposed to become a compact state-transition crossbar for automata supporting large fan-in for states. Scaling to large automata: Supporting all-to-all connectivity between states requires prohibitively large and slow switches. Large real-world automata are typically composed of several connected components, grouped into densely connected partitions with only few (8-16) interconnections between them. This motivated us to explore a hierarchical switch topology with local switches providing rich intra-partition connectivity and global switches providing sparse inter-partition connectivity. To this end, we also design a compiler that automates the mapping of states into SRAM arrays. We propose and evaluate two architectures and mapping policies, one optimized for performance and the other optimized for space, across a set of 20 diverse benchmarks from ANMLZoo [5] and Regex [1] suites. We also demonstrate acceleration of parsing activities in browser front-end as a case study where FSA computations are a bottleneck taking up to 40% of the loading time of web pages [3]. The performance optimized and space optimized designs provide a speedup of 15× and 9× over Micron's AP respectively. © 2017 IEEE.",Scopus,"Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques - Conference Proceedings, PACT",1038

Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime data-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics checking. In this work, we propose Orpheus, a security methodology for defending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution semantics. We address several challenges in reasoning cyber-physical execution semantics of a control program, including the event identification and dependence analysis. As an instantiation of Orpheus, we present a new program behavior model, i.e., the event-Aware finite-state automaton (eFSA). eFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of control programs and incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented exploits if physical events and eFSA's state transitions are inconsistent. We evaluate our prototype's performance by conducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that eFSA can successfully detect different runtime attacks. Our prototype on Raspberry Pi incurs a low overhead, taking 0.0001s for each state transition integrity checking, and 0.063s-0.211s for the cyber-physical contextual consistency checking. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

The world today is ever more interdependent than one would have imagined even half a century ago. However, security as a concept still continues to be heavily influenced by traditional threat and response mechanisms. Traditionally, security is seen as an outcome of effective management of the three pillars of power: economic, military, and political instruments of national power. Economic power is derived from the resources and technology within a state’s borders and the aptitude to trade them; military power comes from the availability of people, material, and technology; and political power is drawn from the potency of leaders and institutions, the people’s support and endorsements from other nation-states. (Dunn Cavelty 2007, p. 89) In the past, conflicts have been the results, invariably, of intense competition amongst the states for resources and acquisition of territories. Wealth creation and, hence, increase in the power of a state, has always been seen as resulting from its ability to conquer territories and thus gain control of resources. The results of these, in turn, were meant to create advantages in trade and domination of markets. Industrial revolution and technological growth gave rise to colonial powers, which exercised enormous control over vast geographical and manpower resources. The end of the colonial system after the World Wars and the end of the Cold War in 1991 have resulted in a world of more than 200 independent, sovereign nation-states and, for most of them, values of democracy, self-determination and sovereignty have become the bedrock of international relations. Ideology-based territorialism, and hunger for resource-driven territorial expansion, in the colonial mould, is largely irrelevant in the 21st century. New patterns are emerging for territorial control, such as the religious fundamentalist route by ISIS for control 85across multi-states, and the historicism route established through reclamation by China in the South China Sea. However, nations continue to be driven by the objectives of wealth creation. Various methodologies are followed in pursuit of this objective: free flow of trade, technology domination, creation and domination of markets through product-driven strategies, and domination of the global commons for distinct advantages to those nations who have started early and have dominant technologies. It gives rise to classical resource-based competition amongst states, which is a serious source of conflict with adverse impact on international security. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Gruszczak and Pawel Frankowski.",Scopus,"Technology, Ethics and the Protocols of Modern War",1045

It is of vital importance to assess the security of such dynamic networks in order to improve the security of them. One way to assess the security is to use a graphical security model. However, the existing graphical security models (e.g., attack graphs and attack trees) have only considered static networks (i.e. the network does not change). It is also unclear how the existing cyber security metrics (e.g., attack cost, shortest attack path) change when the network configuration changes over time. To address this problem, we propose (i) to develop a novel graphical security model named Temporal-Hierarchical Attack Representation Model (T-HARM) to capture network changes and (ii) investigate the effect of network change on the existing cyber security metrics based on the proposed security model. We show how the existing security metrics change when the status of vulnerabilities changes. © 2016 IEEE.",Scopus,"Proceedings - 2016 16th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology, CIT 2016, 2016 6th International Symposium on Cloud and Service Computing, IEEE SC2 2016 and 2016 International Symposium on Security and Privacy in Social Networks and Big Data, SocialSec 2016",1047

A targeted attack (also termed a control aware attack) on the controller/SCADA software can lead a control system to operate in an unsafe mode or sometimes to complete shutdown of the plant. Such malware attacks can result in tremendous cost to the organization for recovery, cleanup, and maintenance activity. SCADA systems in operational mode generate huge log files. These files are useful in analysis of the plant behavior and diagnostics during an ongoing attack. However, they are bulky and difficult for manual inspection. Data mining techniques such as least squares approximation and computational methods can be used in the analysis of logs and to take proactive actions when required. This paper explores methodologies and algorithms so as to develop an effective monitoring scheme against control aware cyber attacks. It also explains soft computation techniques such as the computational geometric method and least squares approximation that can be effective in monitor design. This paper provides insights into diagnostic monitoring of its effectiveness by attack simulations on a four-tank model and using computation techniques to diagnose it. Cyber security of instrumentation and control systems used in nuclear power plants is of paramount importance and hence could be a possible target of such applications. © 2017",Scopus,Nuclear Engineering and Technology,1049

Although this architecture is deployed in cellular (mobile) networks, the latter represents several limitations, notably in terms of security. To overcome this inadequacy, IPsec protocol can be deployed between user equipment (UE) and Proxy Call Session Control Functions (P-CSCF). This solution has certain limitations in terms of reliability, i.e. the same security policy deployed between UE and P-CSCF will be applied to any type of the client traffic. In other words, if network performances are critical and the security policy deployed requires high processing, the transported traffic of real-time characteristic will suffer from a quality deterioration.

This amplified interest in the use of online banking has consequently raised the concerns over the security. This has raised the need to protect online banking in to guard these transactions as well as establishing secure mechanisms for information exchange that prevent fraud and safeguard the personal data. With the internet now popular among all age groups, online banking has become a necessity. Security mechanisms are, therefore a must for the proper functioning of online banking. In addition to this, all the users are required to manage multiple passwords and devices. Security which are provided by the extensively used systems namely knowledge-based security and token-based security can be easily breached when one reveals his password and his cards are stolen. In order to overcome this, biometrics are used. Banks have started using single biometric systems for financial transactions. In order to provide further security for online banking transactions, the proposed system introduces the use of multiple(face and fingerprint) biometrics for online financial transaction where both are required for authentication of log-in-process and one biometric is used for transaction process, thus would help overcome traditional vulnerabilities. Further, this proposed research further explores the matching at the feature level, which of course is a under studied problem. Here in this approach, the feature sets extracted from multiple data sources would be fused to create a new feature set to represent the individual. Since the feature set contains better-off information about the fresh biometric data compared to the match score level or the final decision, combination at this level is possible to provide better authentication results. Initial results indicate that the planned technique can lead to large improvement in multimodal matching performance. © 2016 IEEE.",Scopus,"Proceedings of 2016 Online International Conference on Green Engineering and Technologies, IC-GET 2016",1052

Though issues of cost and stringent marketing deadlines have been resolved in such a methodology, yet the root of hardware trust has been evicted. Malicious circuitry, a.k.a.

A HTH remains dormant during testing but gets triggered at runtime to cause sudden active and passive attacks. In this work, we focus on the runtime passive threats based on the parameter delay. Nature-inspired algorithms offer an alternative to the conventional techniques for solving complex problems in the domain of computer science.

Our approach consists of four main phases: (i) definition of the basic steps of a methodology for run-time safety management; (ii) development of an ontological knowledge-base of safety in work environments; (iii) definition of constraints on the ontology based on organizations’ safety protocols; (iv) communication of relevant information to each actor in the safety management team. We propose a generic ontological model of safety expertise, based on Occupational Safety and Health Regulations (OSHA), that is employed as Knowledge required in our safety management methodology based on the MAPE-K (Monitor–Analyze–Plan–Execute and Knowledge) loop. We present the RAMIRES (Risk-Adaptive Management in Resilient Environments with Security) tool, implementing this methodology. RAMIRES is developed as a dashboard, supporting the safety management team in understanding the risk and its consequences, and to support decision making in risk treatment. RAMIRES interacts with the SWE and the safety management team (actors) in order to: (i) communicate the risks and preventive strategies to actors; (ii) obtain more data about the observed areas to understand the risk and its consequences; and (iii) execute the automatic preventive strategies and support actors in the execution of human-operated preventive strategies. In this paper, we show the details on concepts designed in the safety ontology and illustrate how these concepts can be extended to provide an abstract model of a specific use case. Furthermore, we propose the definition of constraints on the ontology using logic-based rules. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed methodology regarding the resilience of the environment. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,Future Generation Computer Systems,1059

Currently, there are mainly two functions in the developed plant DiD risk monitor software that are knowledge-base editor which is used to model the system in a hierarchical manner and the interaction simulator that simulates the interactions between the different actors in the model. In this paper, a model for playing its behavior is called an Actor which is modeled at the top level. The passive safety AP1000 power plant was studied and the small-break loss-of-coolant accident (SBLOCA) design basis accident transient is modeled using the plant DiD risk monitor software. Furthermore, the simulation result is shown for the interactions between the actors which are defined in the plant DiD risk monitor system as PLANT actor, OPERATOR actor, and SUPERVISOR actor.

In the proposed method, system risk under other operational modes is converted into the security grade under basic operational mode. Thus, when operational mode changes, the security grade change can reflect the degree of system security change and act as a decision support tool for operators.

However, traditional anonymous ABE schemes may not be secure in the real word due to the side-channel attacks. In addition, the existing anonymous ABE schemes are considered in the leak-free scenario assuming that secret keys are not leaked to the adversary. Thus, it is compelling to study the anonymity of ABE schemes in the context of key leakage attacks. Aiming at tackling the challenge above, an anonymous CP-ABE scheme against side-channel attacks in the bounded-leakage model is constructed.

The state space obfuscation is achieved by transforming a given hardware design through judicious modification of the state transition function and insertion of special logic structures at well-chosen locations inside a design. Such modifications perturb the circuit functionality to a maximum extent, while keeping the overall hardware and performance overheads low. Normal functionality is enabled by the application of a specific sequence of vectors at the circuit input, which acts as the enabling key for the circuit. The proposed state space obfuscation methodology effectively locks a gate-level design, and only a legitimate user can unlock it with the application of a predefined key in the form of a sequence of input vectors. We also extend the proposed obfuscation concept to make a given design more robust against hardware Trojan horse (HTH) insertion, thereby increasing the detectability of inserted HTH instances, while incurring low hardware and performance overheads. We present a suitable metric to quantify the level of obfuscation. Finally, we point toward extension of the concept for register transfer level (RTL) circuit descriptions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Scopus,Hardware Protection through Obfuscation,1064

A sensitivity analysis-based method with Graphics processing unit (GPU) is proposed for power systems, which can reduce calculation time by 40% compared to the execution on a 4-core CPU. The proposed method involves load flow analysis and sensitivity analysis. In load flow analysis, a multifrontal method for sparse LU factorization is explored on GPU through dynamic frontal task scheduling between CPU and GPU. The varying matrix operations during sensitivity analysis on GPU are highly optimized in this study. The results of performance evaluations show that the proposed GPU-based SSSA with optimized matrix operations can achieve a significant reduction in computation time.

However, such systems need additional protection from spoofing attacks. In our paper we present full pipeline of anti-spoofing method (based on our previous work) for bimodal audiovisual verification system. This method allows to evaluate parameters of quality for a sequence of face images during a verification process. Based on this parameters it’s decided whether the data is suitable for processing by the standard method (fiducial points based audiovisual liveness detection, FALD). If the quality of data is not sufficient, then our system switches to a new algorithm (svm-based audiovisual liveness detection, SALD), which provides less protection quality, but is able to operate when FALD is unsuitable. To improve the quality of the FALD algorithm we have collected the special dataset. This dataset allows to get better reliability of the algorithm for searching of fiducial points on the user’s face image.

In this paper, we make significant progress in this area in the context of password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) and oblivious transfer (OT) protocols. More precisely, we first revisit the notion of projective hash proofs and introduce a new feature that allows us to explain any message sent by the simulator in case of corruption, hence the notion of Explainable Projective Hashing. Next, we demonstrate that this new tool generically leads to efficient PAKE and OT protocols that are secure against semi-adaptive adversaries without erasures in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We then show how to make these protocols secure even against adaptive adversaries, using non-committing encryption, in a much more efficient way than generic conversions from semiadaptive to adaptive security. Finally, we provide concrete instantiations of explainable projective hash functions that lead to the most efficient PAKE and OT protocols known so far, with UC-security against adaptive adversaries, without assuming reliable erasures, in the single global CRS setting. As an important side contribution, we also propose a new commitment scheme based on DDH, which leads to the construction of the first one-round PAKE adaptively secure under plain DDH without pairing, assuming reliable erasures, and also improves previous constructions of OT and two- or three-round PAKE schemes. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2017.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1068

To support this vision, a range of play-based interfaces were designed by which an operator can team with autonomy (consisting of several intelligent agents/services) to manage twelve air, ground, and sea surface UVs performing security defense tasks for a simulated military base. To enable flexible delegation control, the interfaces were designed to enable the operator to use one or more of three control modalities in calling and editing plays that define UV actions. Specifically, each step defining a play could be completed: (1) manually, via mouse/click inputs, (2) by touching a touchscreen monitor, or (3) via speech commands. This paper reports results relevant to input modality from two experiments where operators were free to choose which modality to employ. Operators overwhelmingly used the mouse compared to the touchscreen or speech and were faster and more accurate with the mouse. Subjective data also favored the mouse modality with operators commenting that it was more intuitive to use with the play calling interfaces.

Resilience properties are then analyzed assuming a lower bound on the fraction of honest players. Honest players, however, are not only assumed to follow the prescribed the protocol, but also assumed to be online throughout the whole execution of the protocol. The advent of “large-scale” consensus protocols (e.g., the blockchain protocol) where we may have millions of players, makes this assumption unrealistic. In this work, we initiate a study of distributed protocols in a “sleepy” model of computation where players can be either online (awake) or offline (asleep), and their online status may change at any point during the protocol. The main question we address is: Can we design consensus protocols that remain resilient under “sporadic participation”, where at any given point, only a subset of the players are actually online? As far as we know, all standard consensus protocols break down under such sporadic participation, even if we assume that 99 % of the online players are honest. Our main result answers the above question in the affirmative. We present a construction of a consensus protocol in the sleepy model, which is resilient assuming only that a majority of the online players are honest. Our protocol relies on a Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI), a Common Random String (CRS) and is proven secure in the timing model of Dwork-Naor-Sahai (STOC’98) where all players are assumed to have weakly-synchronized clocks (all clocks are within Δ of the “real time”) and all messages sent on the network are delivered within Δ time, and assuming the existence of sub-exponentially secure collision-resistant hash functions and enhanced trapdoor permutations. Perhaps surprisingly, our protocol significantly departs from the standard approaches to distributed consensus, and we instead rely on key ideas behind Nakamoto’s blockchain protocol (while dispensing the need for “proofs-of-work”). We finally observe that sleepy consensus is impossible in the presence of a dishonest majority of online players. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2017.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1073

Even though current efforts provide solutions to specific problems under given circumstances, these methods are neither adaptive nor flexible enough to provide security under the dynamic conditions which make the security breaches an important concern. In this paper, a cognitive security (CS) concept for wireless communication systems in the physical layer is proposed with the aim of providing a comprehensive solution to wireless security problems. The proposed method will enable the comprehensive security to ensure a robust and reliable communication in the existence of adversaries by providing adaptive security solutions in the communication systems by exploiting the physical layer security from different perspective. The adaptiveness relies on the fact that radio adapts its propagation characteristics to satisfy secure communication based on specific conditions which are given as user density, application specific adaptation, and location within CS concept. Thus, instead of providing any type of new security mechanism, it is proposed that radio can take the necessary precautions based on these conditions before the attacks occur. Various access scenarios are investigated to enable the CS while considering these conditions. © 2017 Mustafa Harun Yilmaz et al.",Scopus,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,1077

By interacting with local agents of the given compute nodes, the scheduler defines the system node parameters and selects the resources with the specified security and performance requirements. Ensuring an optimum combination of mutually exclusive security and performance parameters is a non-trivial task, requiring the development of new approaches to solving it. The research found that the adaptive distributed system resource security management mechanism increases the DCS performance in comparison with the classical resource security management mechanism. In particular, the research shows that the average task time in the queue and the average task time in the system with the adaptive security level management mechanism is 2.8 and 2.1 times lower, respectively, in comparison with the classical security level management mechanism. At the same time, the adaptive security management introduction requires additional software on the DCS compute nodes for the CN status parameters monitoring. The experiments demonstrate that the monitoring system can significantly reduce the DCS performance. Thus, according to the experiments, in case of 25 % load on the DCS CN from the monitoring system, the average task time in the queue and the average task time in the system increase by 62 % compared with a situation where monitoring is not performed. The research results need to be considered when introducing the secure data processing mechanisms in DCS to prevent a substantial decrease in the distributed system performance. © Hu Zhenbing, V.

Directed to the problem of the improper defensive strategy selection caused by inaccurately characterizing the attack and defense game in MTD, optimal strategy selection for MTD based on Markov game (MG) is proposed to balance the hopping defensive revenue and network service quality. On the one hand, traditional matrix game structure often fails to describe MTD confrontation accurately. To deal with this inaccuracy, MTD based on MG is constructed. Markov decision process is used to characterize the transition among network multi-states. Dynamic game is used to characterize the multi-phases of attack and defense in MTD circumstances. Besides, it converts all the attack and defense actions into the changes in attack surface or the ones in exploration surface, thus improving the universality of the proposed model. On the other hand, traditional models care little about defense cost in the process of optimal strategy selection. After comprehensively analyzing the impact of defense cost and defense benefit on the strategy selection, an optimal strategy selection algorithm is designed to prevent the deviation of the selected strategies from actual network conditions, thus ensuring the correctness of optimal strategy selection. Finally, the simulation and the deduction of the proposed approach are given in case study so as to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy optimal selection approach. © 2013 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Access,1080

The traditional geographic information system (GIS) mostly manages time-discretized geospatial data by means of the Structured Query Language (SQL) database management system (DBMS) and emphasizes query and retrieval of massive historical geospatial data on disk. This limits its capability for on-the-fly access of real-time geospatial data for online analysis in real time. This paper proposes a hybrid database organization and management approach with SQL relational databases (RDB) and not only SQL (NoSQL) databases (including the main memory database, MMDB, and distributed files system, DFS). This hybrid approach makes full use of the advantages of NoSQL and SQL DBMS for the real-time access of input data and structured on-the-fly analysis results which can meet the requirements of increased spatio-temporal big data linking analysis. The MMDB facilitates real-time access of the latest input data such as the sensor web and IoT, and supports the real-time query for online geospatial analysis. The RDB stores change information such as multi-modal features and abnormal events extracted from real-time input data. The DFS on disk manages the massive geospatial data, and the extensible storage architecture and distributed scheduling of a NoSQL database satisfy the performance requirements of incremental storage and multi-user concurrent access. A case study of geographic video (GeoVideo) surveillance of public security is presented to prove the feasibility of this hybrid organization and management approach.",Scopus,ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,1081

Unlike the traditional wired network, VANETs are characterized by numerous new features, e.g., quick movement and unstable channel.

Multi-agent systems often need to operate in unsafe environments, and hence there is a need for situational awareness and risk assessment security mechanism that can evaluate agent data to detect threats and analyse the risk posed by them. Basic belief-desire-intention (BDI) architecture lacks a framework that would facilitate effective communication, to bring about situational awareness among agents in an insecure environment. This paper addresses the problems faced by a group of agents lacking global knowledge and global communications, by the introduction of a belief sharing and risk assessment mechanism. We have extended basic BDI architecture with the concept of situational awareness and adaptive risk management. With the proposed architecture, agents can gain awareness by exchanging beliefs, ascertaining the truth of such beliefs and measuring the credibility of a peer agent.

This technology will permit billions of devices to interconnect over the Internet giving rise to an unprecedented number of new applications, services and business opportunities: from smart energy management to intelligent cities and intelligent transportation, from surveillance to eHealthcare and ambient environments. Technology in its bare form, as devices and equipment used by humans, will be pushed far in the background. The interaction of humans will be based on devices hidden in the environment (device physically ""disappearing) or devices that are not perceived as computational objects but rather through the changes, they create in terms of sound, movement, light, smell or taste. Today's devices, which can be characterized by a single type (mode) of interface, will be replaced by multi-modal interfaces that have the ability to simultaneously affect several of the seven human senses. This paradigm is defined as Ambient Intelligence (AmI). The Ambient Intelligence is a way to extend human capabilities and empower people by means of interactions with the new ambient environment. AmI has opened the way to new technologies and platforms and can be applied in numerous areas, but when specifically related to ""assisted living"" the term Ambient Assisted Living is adopted. This chapter focuses on introducing the M2M technology, the existing standards and challenges, and the role it can play in realizing the AAL paradigm, in the context of eHealthcare systems. Such systems are especially suitable for elderly people, who naturally have much reduced sensory or physical interaction abilities. Based on M2M communications AAL will allow to intelligently monitor their physical conditions and intervene when necessary; to increase the quality of their life; to empower them to carry on a fulfilling social life even when physically restricted. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we focus on the employment of iO in order to construct short signatures with strong security guarantees (i.e., adaptive security) that provide a very efficient signing process for resource-constrained devices. Sahai and Waters (SW) (STOC 2014) initially explored the construction of iO -based short signature schemes but their proposal provides selective security. Ramchen and Waters (RW) (CCS 2014) attempted to provide stronger security guarantees (i.e., adaptive security) but their proposal is much more computationally expensive than the SW proposal. In this work, we propose an iO -based short signature scheme that provides adaptive security, fast signing for resource-constrained devices and is much more cost-efficient than the RW signature scheme. More precisely, we employ a puncturable PRF with a fixed length input to get a fast and adaptively secure signature scheme without any additional hardness assumption as in the SW signature scheme. To achieve this goal, we employ the technique of Hofheinz et al. called “delayed backdoor programming” using a random oracle, which allows to embed an execution thread that will only be invoked by special inputs generated using secret key information. Furthermore, we compare the cost of our signature scheme in terms of the cost of the underlying PRG used by the puncturable PRF. Our scheme has a much lower cost than the RW scheme, while providing strong security guarantees (i.e., adaptive security). © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1088

Focused on this issue, the method of fusing attack graph model and Hidden Markov model (HMM) was proposed. Firstly, the network environment and attacker's aggressive behavior were abstracted by the attack graph model; Secondly, the probabilistic mapping that was between network observation and attack status was established by the HMM; Finally, the Viterbi algorithm was used to calculate the maximum probability state transition sequence. Experimental results show that the maximum probability of the state transition sequence can be effectively calculated and then the attack intention can be accurately inferred by this dual model.

We consider not only the classic real-time and quality of service requirements, but also the emerging security and power efficiency demands. Modern embedded systems are not any more developed for a fixed purpose, but instead designed for undertaking various processing requests. This leads to the concept of multimode embedded systems, in which the number and nature of active tasks change during runtime. Under dynamic situations, providing high performance along with various design concerns becomes a really difficult problem. Therefore, we propose a novel power-aware secure embedded systems design framework that efficiently solves the problem of runtime quality optimization with security and power constraints.

To tame this complexity, we propose AnBx, a formal protocol specification language based on the popular Alice & Bob notation. AnBx offers channels as the main abstraction for communication, providing different authenticity and/or confidentiality guarantees for message transmission. AnBx extends existing proposals in the literature with a novel notion of forwarding channels, enforcing specific security guarantees from the message originator to the final recipient along a number of intermediate forwarding agents. We give a formal semantics of AnBx in terms of a state transition system expressed in the AVISPA Intermediate Format. We devise an ideal channel model and a possible cryptographic implementation, and we show that, under mild restrictions, the two representations coincide, thus making AnBx amenable to automated verification with different tools.

This paper proposes two artificial neural networks namely multi-layer feed forward neural network (MFNN) and radial basis function network (RBFN) to realize the online power system static security assessment (PSSSA) module. To assess the severity of the system, two indices have been used, namely active power performance index and voltage performance index, which are computed using Newton-Raphson load flow (NRLF) analysis for variable loading conditions under N - 1 line outage contingencies. The proposed MFNN and RBFN models based PSSSA module, are fed with power system operating states, load conditions and N - 1 line outage contingencies as input features to train the neural network models, to predict the performance indices for unseen network conditions and rank them in descending order based on performance indices for security assessment. The proposed approaches are tested on standard IEEE 30-bus test system, where the simulation results prove its performance and robustness for power system static security assessment. The comparison of severity obtained by the neural network models and the NRLF analysis in terms of time and accuracy, signifies that the proposed model is quick, accurate and robust for power system static security evaluation for unseen network conditions. Thus, the proposed PSSSA module implemented using MFNN and RBFN models are found to be feasible for online implementation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style has been extensively used recently for integrating services and applications. Its adoption to build SOA-based distributed systems brings several benefits, but also poses new challenges and risks. Particularly important among those risks are failures to effectively address quality attribute requirements such as security, reliability, and performance. A proved efficient technique to identify and help mitigate those risks is the architecture evaluation. In this paper we propose an approach, tooling, and guidelines to aid architecture evaluation activities in REST-based systems. These guidelines can be systematically used along with evaluation methods to reason about design considerations and tradeoffs. To demonstrate how the guidelines can help architecture evaluators, we present a proof of concept describing how to use the guidelines in an ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) evaluation. We also present the results of a survey conducted with industry specialists who have performed architecture evaluations in real world REST-based systems in order to gauge the suitability and utility of the proposed guidelines.

In this method, each state should be known to the sink, in order to predict accurately. Also, in some cases, if the residual energy estimation is not based on the operational states of a sensor node, it may not reflect the exact amount of energy consumed by each node. In order to overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose to design an intrusion detection system to detect and mitigate the attacks using energy monitoring technique. In this technique, the malicious attacks are detected by monitoring the node's energy. The monitoring nodes predicts the energy using hidden Markov model (HMM) and compares it with the actual energy detected through an energy query technique. The detected attacks are classified based on the energy threshold levels. The attacks are then mitigated by establishing the attack-free route between source and destination, respectively.

Dual system encryption methodology is developed to guide design and analysis of various functional encryption schemes (FEs) with adaptive security. Observing the compatibility of dual system methodology and leakage-resilience, Lewko et al. present constructions of a number of strong leakage-resilient functional encryptions. In particular, they present fully secure identity-based encryption (IBE), hierarchical IBE (HIBE) and attribute-based encryption (ABE) satisfying the continual memory leakage (CML) model, one of the strongest models that allows continuous leakage on both user and master secret keys. Inspired by the recent work from Attrapadung on pair encodings which greatly simplifies the design and analysis of FE, we propose a generic framework for constructing fully secure FEs in the CML model (LR-FEs). Specifically, our framework “compiles” predicate encodings into fully secure LR-FEs in a two-step process. Firstly, we propose a generic transformation of pair encoding schemes into their leakage-resilient forms. Next, we present another conversion that turns leakage-resilient pair encodings into fully secure LR-FEs. Our framework is highly compatible with Attrapadung’s, meaning that it is applicable to many existing pair encoding schemes. The contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, our framework simplifies the design and analysis of LR-FEs into the design and analysis of predicate encodings. Secondly, our framework allows us to improve the security of some existing LR-FEs, such as LR-IBE with a tighter reduction. Thirdly, we discover new adaptively secure LR-FEs, including FE for regular languages, ABE for large universe and ABE with short ciphertext. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1111

Many practical memory devices such as solid state drives, hard disks, or file systems are not perfectly erasable because a deletion operation leaves traces of the deleted data in the system. A number of methods for constructing a large erasable memory from a small one, e.g., using encryption, have been proposed. Despite the importance of erasable memory in cryptography, no formal model has been proposed that allows one to formally analyse such memory constructions or cryptographic protocols relying on erasable memory. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we provide a formal model of erasable memory. A memory device allows a user to store, retrieve, and delete data, and it is characterised by a leakage function defining the extent to which erased data is still accessible to an adversary. Second, we investigate how the erasability of such memories can be amplified. We provide a number of constructions of memories with strong erasability guarantees from memories with weaker guarantees. One of these constructions of perfectly erasable memories from imperfectly erasable ones can be considered as the prototypical application of Canetti et al.’s All-or-Nothing Transform (AoNT). Motivated by this construction, we propose some new and better AoNTs that are either perfectly or computationally secure. These AoNTs are of possible independent interest. Third, we show (in the constructive cryptography framework) how the construction of erasable memory and its use in cryptographic protocols (for example to achieve adaptive security) can naturally be composed to obtain provable security of the overall protocol. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1114

While this revolution promises to transform silicon markets and drive a number of disruptive changes in society, it is also the case that the protocols, complexity, and security issues of extremely large dynamic, co-mingled networks is still poorly understood. Furthermore, embedded system developers, to include military and aerospace users, have largely ignored the potential (good and bound) of the cloudlike, possibly intermingling networks having variable structure to how future systems might be engineered. In this paper, we consider a new interpretation of IoT inspired modular architecture strategies involving the representational state transfer (REST) model, in which dynamic networks with variable structure employ stateless application programming interface (API) concepts. The power of the method, which extends concepts originally developed for space plug-and-play avionics, is that it allows for the fluid co-mingling of hardware and software in networks whose structure can overlap and evolve. Paradoxically, these systems may have the most stringent determinism and fault-tolerant needs. In this paper we review how RESTful APIs can potentially be used to design, create, test, and deploy systems rapidly while addressing security and referential integrity even when the nodes of many systems might physically co-mingle. We will also explore ways to take advantage of the RESTful paradigm for fault tolerance and what extensions might be necessary to deal with high-performance and determinism. © 2016 SPIE.",Scopus,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,1117

In the semi-adaptive model the attacker is forced to disclose the challenge messages before it makes any key queries, but is allowed to see the public parameters. We show how to generically transform any selectively secure ABE or FE scheme into one that is semi-adaptively secure with the only additional assumption being public key encryption, which is already naturally included in almost any scheme of interest. Our technique utilizes a fairly simple application of garbled circuits where instead of encrypting directly, the encryptor creates a garbled circuit that takes as input the public parameters and outputs a ciphertext in the underlying selective scheme. Essentially, the encryption algorithm encrypts without knowing the ‘real’ public parameters. This allows one to delay giving out the underlying selective parameters until a private key is issued, which connects the semi-adaptive to selective security. The methods used to achieve this result suggest that the moral gap between selective and semi-adaptive security is in general much smaller than that between semiadaptive and full security. Finally, we show how to extend the above idea to generically bundle a family of functionalities under one set of public parameters. For example, suppose we had an inner product predicate encryption scheme where the length of the vectors was specified at setup and therefore fixed to the public parameters. Using our transformation one could create a system where for a single set of public parameters the vector length is not apriori bounded, but instead is specified by the encryption algorithm. The resulting ciphertext would be compatible with any private key generated to work on the same input length. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2016.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1119

There are two types of adaptively-secure protocols: Adaptive with erasures and adaptive without erasures. Achieving adaptivity without erasures is preferable, since secure erasures are not always trivial. However, it seems far harder. We introduce a new model of adaptive security called adaptive security with partial erasures that allows erasures, but only assumes them in a minimal sense. Specifically, if all parties are corrupted then security holds as long as any single party successfully erases. In addition, security holds if any proper subset of the parties is corrupted without erasures. We initiate a theoretical study of this new notion and demonstrate that secure computation in this setting is as efficient as static secure computation.

The security of IP cores connected with the NoC infrastructure has been widely studied in previous work; however, countermeasures for the security threats in NoCs themselves lack investigation. In the first phase of our method, we add key bits to the finite state machine of the NI control unit and create dummy states to increase the difficulty for the execution of meaningful attacks. In the second phase, we examine the illegal states and illegal state transitions induced by a wrong key to detect the occurrence of HTs. Simulation results show that our method obtains a HT detection rate of over 97.5% and reduces the probability of a successful HT attack by 71.5%. Our synthesized netlist with a 65nm technology shows that the NI using the proposed method only increases the area overhead by 3.2%, over the baseline NI design. © 2015 IEEE.",Scopus,Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems,1128

Recent trends of IP piracy and reverseengineering, and malicious circuit modifications (""hardware Trojans"") in remote fabrication facilities, are major concerns. In this chapter, we propose a comprehensive secure SoC design flow based on the principle of design obfuscation that can provide effective protection against IP piracy as well as hardware Trojan attacks. We present the overall approach and illustrate the obfuscation process with an example. We provide a brief survey of related work on hardware obfuscation and then present two variations of obfuscation, which differ in the level of protection and the complexity of implementation. The first approach is based on extraction and modification of the state transition from the gate-level synthesized design, such that normal operation is possible only on the successful application of a correct initialization sequence. Optionally, an obfuscated register transfer level (RTL) design can be generated by de-compilation of the obfuscated netlist. In the second approach, a register transfer level IP is obfuscated by manipulating its control and data flow graphs. The proposed approaches are scalable, and can be integrated in the SoC design and manufacturing flow to benefit all parties associated with the design flow, while minimally affecting the end-user experience. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

It is a promising concept to provide the high data rate requirements for bandwidth hungry applications like social networking, multimedia services etc. It facilitates better utilization of radio resources and shorter transmitter receiver delays and therefore better user performance. In this paper framework for studying performance of D2D communications in orthogonal frequency division multiple access based multicellular scenario is developed using downlink cellular resources. The load condition of D2D mode in addition to that of cellular mode plays an important role. The performance of both modes for their respective load conditions have been analyzed. The key parameters analysed are ratio of signal power to noise plus interference power (SINR), outage probabilty, effect of variation in D2D transmitter power, capacity, mode selection and D2D mode switching distance. The goal of the paper is to find the optimum distance for switching to D2D mode from cellular mode for loads with different power ratios. The results shows that D2D communications is beneficial for cellular edge UEs and improves their capacity. It is seen that with increase in load in both the cellular and D2D modes the corresponding link capacity falls. It is also seen that as the cellular load increases, the switching distance moves away from BS while it moves towards the BS when the D2D load increases. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Scopus,Wireless Personal Communications,1130

EDS are increasingly dependent on networked computing assets, as are many Industrial Control Systems. Consequently, cyber-attacks pose a real and pertinent threat, as evidenced by Stuxnet, Shamoon and Dragonfly. Hence, there is a critical need for novel methods to detect, prevent, and mitigate effects of such attacks. To detect cyber-attacks in EDS, we developed a framework for gathering and analyzing timing data that involves establishing a baseline execution profile and then capturing the effect of perturbations in the state from injecting various malware. The data analysis was based on nonlinear dynamics and graph theory to improve detection of anomalous events in cyber applications. The goal was the extraction of changing dynamics or anomalous activity in the underlying computer system. Takens' theorem in nonlinear dynamics allows reconstruction of topologically invariant, time-delay-embedding states from the computer data in a sufficiently high-dimensional space. The resultant dynamical states were nodes, and the state-to-state transitions were links in a mathematical graph. Alternatively, sequential tabulation of executing instructions provides the nodes with corresponding instruction-to-instruction links. Graph theorems guarantee graphinvariant measures to quantify the dynamical changes in the running applications.

In this work, on-line monitoring is carried out by comparing environmental state transitions with prior beliefs descriptive of optimal behavior. The agent policy is computed analytically using linearly solvable Markov decision processes. Active inference using prior beliefs allows a monitor proactively rehearsing on-line future agent actions over a rolling horizon so as to generate expectations to discover surprising behaviors. A Bayesian surprise metric is proposed based on twin Gaussian processes to measure the difference between prior and posterior beliefs about state transitions in the agent environment. Using a sliding window of sampled data, beliefs are updated a posteriori by comparing a sequence of state transitions with the ones predicted using the optimal policy.

With the advantages of low cost and fast access speed, non-volatile memories (NVMs) like NAND flash memory have become a critical component in building security-critical real-time embedded devices. Therefore, to improve the security protection of NVM-based embedded systems becomes a great challenge. In this paper, we are interested in online optimization of security-sensitive storage applications over modern NVM-based embedded systems, whose workloads are unpredictable but have explicit timing constraint and certain security constraint. Sensitive data must be stored before a specific deadline, otherwise it will lose its validity. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Feedback Vulnerability and Utilization Control (FVUC) mechanism. FVUC employs two proportional-integral controllers, the Utilization Controller and the Vulnerability Controller, to build a big feedback loop which dynamically monitors the system run-time status as well as decides how many flash pages would be encrypted by a cryptography service. Relied on the accurate model and design, FVUC can make a balance between the utilization and vulnerability, and achieve a better overall performance. Based on synthetic experiments, we obtain that FVUC can fully beat other three mechanisms on the overall performance with acceptable time overhead. Equipped with proportional-integral controller, FVUC can make the system more stable than the one with only proportional controller. The proposed mechanism can be utilized to resist on-line confidential attack and even achieve the off-line privacy protection when embedded devices are lost or stolen. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we provide a declarative semantics for SMP through a translation from SMP to Answer Set Programming (ASP). We show that our translation is sound and complete for bounded SMP reasoning. With this translation, we are able not only to directly compute users’ authorization query answers, but also to specifically extract information of how users’ authorization states change in relation to the underlying query answering. In this way, we eventually avoid SMP’s tedious proof system and significantly simply the SMP reasoning process. Furthermore, we argue that the proposed ASP translation of SMP also provides a flexibility to enhance SMP’s capacity for accommodating more complex authorization reasoning problems that the current SMP lacks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1138

We introduce the Capability URL (CURL) as the unit of communication capability and show how two distinct mechanisms, communication capability and mobile code, can be combined to express and enforce constraints on the communications among decentralized computations. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

While this may be beneficial from the performance and energy perspective, it certainly exhibits new challenges in terms of security due to increased data transmission over networks with potentially unknown threats. Among possible security issues are timing attacks which are not prevented by traditional cryptographic security. Metrics on which offloading decisions are based must include security aspects in addition to performance and energy-efficiency. This paper aims at quantifying the security attributes and their impact on the performance of mobile offloading systems. The offloading system is modeled as a hybrid CTMC and queueing model. The proposed model focuses on state transition and state-based control. The quantification analysis is carried out for steady-state behavior of the CTMC model as to optimize the weighted-sum cost measure. By transforming the security model to a model with absorbing state, we compute the “mean time to security failure” (MTTSF) measure. Finally, a security and performance tradeoff measure is computed based on the system model and optimum parameter set is found for the system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1142

Our reduction has polynomial loss to the underlying primitives. We develop a “punctured programming” approach to constructing and proving systems where outside of obfuscation we rely only on primitives realizable from pseudo random generators. Our work consists of two constructions. Our first FE construction is provably secure against any attacker that is limited to making all of its private key queries after it sees the challenge ciphertext. (This notion implies selective security.) Our construction makes use of an we introduce called puncturable deterministic encryption (PDE) which may be of independent interest. With this primitive in place we show a simple FE construction. We then provide a second construction that achieves adaptive security from indistinguishability obfuscation. Our central idea is to achieve an adaptively secure functional encryption by bootstrapping from a one bounded FE scheme that is adaptively secure. By using bootstrapping we can use “selective-ish” techniques at the outer level obfuscation level and push down the challenge of dealing with adaptive security to the one bounded FE scheme, where it has been already been solved. We combine our bootstrapping framework with a new “key signaling” technique to achieve our construction and proof.

The entropy is used to describe the macro state of a self-organization system in physics. The entropy change indicates the system macro state change. This paper provides a method to construct crowd behavior microstates and the corresponded probability distribution using the individuals' velocity information (magnitude and direction). Then an entropy model was built up to describe the crowd behavior macro state. Simulation experiments and video detection experiments were conducted. It was verified that in the disordered state, the crowd behavior entropy is close to the theoretical maximum entropy; while in ordered state, the entropy is much lower than half of the theoretical maximum entropy. The crowd behavior macro state sudden change leads to the entropy change. The proposed entropy model is more applicable than the order parameter model in crowd behavior detection. By recognizing the entropy mutation, it is possible to detect the crowd behavior macro state automatically by utilizing cameras. Results will provide data support on crowd emergency prevention and on emergency manual intervention. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, there is a great demand for autonomous systems able to detect abnormal events such as violent acts aboard passenger cars and intrusions when the train is parked at the depot. To this end, we present an innovative approach which aims at providing efficient automatic event detection by fusing video and audio analytics and reducing the false alarm rate compared to classical stand-alone video detection. The multi-modal system is composed of two microphones and one camera and integrates onboard video and audio analytics and fusion capabilities. On the one hand, for detecting intrusion, the system relies on the fusion of ""unusual"" audio events detection with intrusion detections from video processing. The audio analysis consists in modeling the normal ambience and detecting deviation from the trained models during testing. This unsupervised approach is based on clustering of automatically extracted segments of acoustic features and statistical Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) modeling of each cluster. The intrusion detection is based on the three-dimensional (3D) detection and tracking of individuals in the videos. On the other hand, for violent events detection, the system fuses unsupervised and supervised audio algorithms with video event detection. The supervised audio technique detects specific events such as shouts. A GMM is used to catch the formant structure of a shout signal. Video analytics use an original approach for detecting aggressive motion by focusing on erratic motion patterns specific to violent events. As data with violent events is not easily available, a normality model with structured motions from non-violent videos is learned for one-class classification. A fusion algorithm based on Dempster-Shafer's theory analyses the asynchronous detection outputs and computes the degree of belief of each probable event. © 2015 SPIE.",Scopus,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,1146

In many known constructions of FE schemes, security is guaranteed only for messages that are fixed ahead of time (i.e., before the adversary even interacts with the system). This so-called selective security is too restrictive for many realistic applications. Achieving adaptive security (also called full security), where security is guaranteed even for messages that are adaptively chosen at any point in time, seems significantly more challenging. The handful of known adaptively-secure schemes are based on specifically tailored techniques that rely on strong assumptions (such as obfuscation or multilinear maps assumptions) can be transformed into an adaptively-secure one without introducing any additional assumptions. We present a black-box transformation, for both public-key and private-key schemes, making novel use of hybrid encryption, a classical technique that was originally introduced for improving the efficiency of encryption schemes. We adapt the hybrid encryption approach to the setting of functional encryption via a technique for embedding a “hidden execution thread” in the decryption keys of the underlying scheme, which will only be activated within the proof of security of the resulting scheme. As an additional application of this technique, we show how to construct functional encryption schemes for arbitrary circuits starting from ones for shallow circuits (NC1 or even TC0). © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2015.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1147

The main problem of integration is to develop an optimized pattern for the monitoring system: the data collecting net (DCN) should combine certain types of measurement units, such as automatic control stations monitoring geological processes, monitoring stations controlled by regular manual checking, mobile control by vehicles or helicopters, and remote control. Integrated control stations are very important for overcoming the problem of integration. The problem of representativeness can be solved based on two approaches: (1) Revealing the landscape pattern of the area under control using the technique of landscape indicators; (2) Detecting water migration flows by remote sensing data interpretation and digital terrain model (DTM) analysis. The solution to the problem of adaptability of monitoring systems is having an adaptive pattern to the system design. System adaptability results from (1) its ability to change the pattern of data acquisition and the operating mode, according to changes in the environment; (2) changes in the number of control stations; (3) changes of the set of control parameters; (4) changes in observation frequency and data processing procedures. An algorithm for changes of observation frequency is offered. The paper shows that the risk assessment subsystem is an obligatory part of the monitoring system for environmental security of energy supply infrastructure. It is shown that quantitative risk assessment for, say, damage to an engineering structure can be more effective using methods involving determining a mathematical morphology of the landscape. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.",Scopus,Environmental Security of the European Cross-Border Energy Supply Infrastructure,1150

Adaptive UC-Secure Computation: We provide a round-efficient compiler that transforms any stand-alone semi-honest adaptively secure multiparty computation to adaptive UC-security. Recently, Dana et. al (Asiacrypt 2013) showed how to acheive adaptive UC-security in any trusted setup under minimal assumptions. They achieve this by constructing an O(n)-round adaptively secure concurrent non-malleable commitment scheme. The main contribution of our work shows how to achieve the same in O(1)-rounds. 2.

Systems in these contexts are often designed to support decision making, such as responding to alerts triggered by sensors and incidents detected by surveillance systems as well as to provide useful information for monitoring and emergency-response teams concerned with health and public safety. Various tools and techniques from different fields such as operations research, computer vision, image and video processing, pattern recognition, and multimedia fusion have contributed to the proliferation of such systems in the context of Hajj. In this paper, a systematic review and synthesis of the representative works that have been done in the field of multimedia surveillance for event detection in Hajj is presented.

Administrative models specify the rules for state transition for any given access control model. While security analysis of role-based access control (RBAC) systems has been done using administrative models, work on security analysis of its temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal extensions has so far not considered the presence of any corresponding administrative model. In this paper, we present a methodology for performing security analysis of temporal RBAC (TRBAC) where state changes occur using the relations defined in a recently proposed administrative model named as AMTRAC (Administrative Model for Temporal Role-based Access Control). We initially define a number of security properties for TRBAC. These properties along with a representation of the TRBAC system and the administrative relations in AMTRAC are then formally specified using Alloy, a first order logic based language. Subsequently, validity of the specified properties is analyzed using the Alloy analyzer. We study the impact of the number of roles, users and temporal elements of TRBAC as well as various relations defined in AMTRAC on the time taken for security analysis. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the key aspects of this challenge is deploying intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that can operate in heterogeneous and large scale environments. This is particularly difficult because the majority of existing IDSs are not designed to work in a cooperative fashion. The integration becomes more difficult when we should reduce computing and memory costs incurred by the high speed IDSs communication. Service oriented architecture (SOA) is one of the key paradigms that enables the deployment of services at large-scale over the internet domain and its integration with IDSs may open new pathways for novel applications and research. Characteristics such as platform transparency and loose coupling make the web services technology a good choice for IDS integration. In this context, this paper presents a lightweight RESTful communication model for coordinating different entities of a high speed distributed IDS.

This article proposes a stochastic game based approach to security and intrusion response in enterprise networks. To analyze the intrusion response scenario, this paper formally represents the real-time interaction of an attacker and network administrator as a two-player non-zero-sum stochastic game. The network configuration information and vulnerability scan results of an enterprise network are used to construct a network security state space, where a network security state changes as a result of actions taken by the attacker/ administrator. Using the modeled stochastic game, a quantitative decision making framework has been proposed for enterprise network administrators to identify his optimal actions in case of network intrusion. Experimentations show that proposed model scales well with networks consisting of number of hosts in order of hundreds. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1158

This is achieved by sharing of resources and service instances among multiple ""tenants"" of the cloud-hosted application. However, supporting multi-tenancy adds more complexity to SaaS applications required capabilities. Security is one of these key requirements that must be addressed when engineering multi-tenant SaaS applications. The sharing of resources among tenants - i.e. multi-tenancy - increases tenants' concerns about the security of their cloud-hosted assets. Compounding this, existing traditional security engineering approaches do not fit well with the multi-tenancy application model where tenants and their security requirements often emerge after the applications and services were first developed. The resultant applications do not usually support diverse security capabilities based on different tenants' needs, some of which may change at run-time i.e. after cloud application deployment. We introduce a novel model-driven security engineering approach for multi-tenant, cloud-hosted SaaS applications. Our approach is based on externalizing security from the underlying SaaS application, allowing both application/service and security to evolve at runtime. Multiple security sets can be enforced on the same application instance based on different tenants' security requirements. We use abstract models to capture service provider and multiple tenants' security requirements and then generate security integration and configurations at runtime. We use dependency injection and dynamic weaving via Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to integrate security within critical application/service entities at runtime. We explain our approach, architecture and implementation details, discuss a usage example, and present an evaluation of our approach on a set of open source web applications. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Scopus,Automated Software Engineering,1164

The first two chapters focus on practical considerations of cloud computing. In Chapter 1, Chandramouli, Iorga, and Chokani describe the evolution of cloud computing and the current state of practice, followed by the challenges of cryptographic key management in the cloud. In Chapter 2, Chen and Sion present a dollar cost model of cloud computing and explore the economic viability of cloud computing with and without security mechanisms involving cryptographic mechanisms. The next two chapters address security issues of the cloud infrastructure. In Chapter 3, Szefer and Lee describe a hardware-enhanced security architecture that protects the confidentiality and integrity of a virtual machine's memory from an untrusted or malicious hypervisor. In Chapter 4, Tsugawa et al. discuss the security issues introduced when Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is deployed within and across clouds. Chapters 5-9 focus on the protection of data stored in the cloud. In Chapter 5, Wang et al. present two storage isolation schemes that enable cloud users with high security requirements to verify that their disk storage is isolated from some or all other users, without any cooperation from cloud service providers. In Chapter 6, De Capitani di Vimercati, Foresti, and Samarati describe emerging approaches for protecting data stored externally and for enforcing fine-grained and selective accesses on them, and illustrate how the combination of these approaches can introduce new privacy risks. In Chapter 7, Le, Kant, and Jajodia explore data access challenges in collaborative enterprise computing environments where multiple parties formulate their own authorization rules, and discuss the problems of rule consistency, enforcement, and dynamic updates. In Chapter 8, Smith et al. address key challenges to the practical realization of a system that supports query execution over remote encrypted data without exposing decryption keys or plaintext at the server. In Chapter 9, Sun et al. provide an overview of secure search techniques over encrypted data, and then elaborate on a scheme that can achieve privacy-preserving multi-keyword text search. The next three chapters focus on the secure deployment of computations to the cloud. In Chapter 10, Oktay el al. present a risk-based approach for workload partitioning in hybrid clouds that selectively outsources data and computation based on their level of sensitivity. The chapter also describes a vulnerability assessment framework for cloud computing environments. In Chapter 11, Albanese et al. present a solution for deploying a mission in the cloud while minimizing the mission's exposure to known vulnerabilities, and a cost-effective approach to harden the computational resources selected to support the mission. In Chapter 12, Kontaxis et al. describe a system that generates computational decoys to introduce uncertainty and deceive adversaries as to which data and computation is legitimate. The last section of the book addresses issues related to security monitoring and system resilience. In Chapter 13, Zhou presents a secure, provenance-based capability that captures dependencies between system states, tracks state changes over time, and that answers attribution questions about the existence, or change, of a system's state at a given time. In Chapter 14, Wu et al. present a monitoring capability for multicore architectures that runs monitoring threads concurrently with user or kernel code to constantly check for security violations. Finally, in Chapter 15, Hasan Cam describes how to manage the risk and resilience of cyber-physical systems by employing controllability and observability techniques for linear and non-linear systems. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

Metadata representation schemes are extremely important to facilitate (system) interoperability and to define ground truth annotations for surveillance research and benchmarks. Surveillance places specific requirements on these metadata representation schemes. This paper offers a clear and coherent terminology, and uses this to present these requirements and to evaluate them in three ways: their fitness in breadth for surveillance design patterns, their fitness in depth for a specific surveillance scenario, and their realism on the basis of existing schemes. It is also validated that no existing metadata representation scheme fulfils all requirements. Guidelines are offered to those who wish to select or create a metadata scheme for surveillance for security. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Scopus,Multimedia Tools and Applications,1167

The current technologies that support vehicular travel like wired sensors, inductive loops, surveillance camera etc., are expensive and also require high maintenance cost. Further the accuracy of these devices also depends on environment conditions. The typical traditional approaches attempt to optimize traffic lights control for a particular density and configuration of traffic. However, the major disadvantage of using these techniques is that the dynamic behavior of traffic densities and configurations change is difficult to model constantly. Traffic seems to be an adaptation problem rather than an optimization problem. This paper therefore tries to address the above issue, and hence we propose algorithms which perform adaptive traffic light control using a wireless sensor network setup. The paper aims at analyzing methods to build an intelligent system that can blend and support some of the existing technologies of traffic control and therefore reduce the average waiting time of vehicles on a junction. The proposed algorithms are adaptive to traffic flow at any intersection point of roads. Simulations of the real-life traffic scenarios are conducted in a simulated platform called Green Light District Simulator (GLD) to generate graph average waiting time versus cycles. The results generated show that the proposed method is effective for the traffic control in a real road intersection. © 2013 IEEE.",Scopus,"Proceedings of IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications, AICCSA",1168

Then, we construct a channel state transition diagram that characterizes this channel model. We obtain the effective secure capacity which describes the maximum constant buffer arrival rate under given QoS constraints. We find out the optimal transmission power policies that maximize the effective secure capacity, and then, we propose an algorithm that, in general, converges quickly to these optimal policy values.

Representational state transfer (REST) is an architectural style that has attracted attention in the SOA domain as it allows the development of Web services based on original principles of the World Wide Web. Unlike Web service specifications, which are based on Simple Object Access Protocol and Web Services Description Language, REST does not provide 'official' standards to address non-functional requirements of services, such as security, reliability, and transaction control. The timestamp-based two-phase commit protocol for RESTful service (TS2PC4RS) algorithm specifies concurrency control of RESTful services during a transaction. An extension of the TS2PC4RS specifies the concurrency control of the Web services considering the update operation to meet some business rules. However, neither algorithm addresses transaction control when failures occur. In long-term transactions, failures can occur and compromise the success of Web service applications. Two common failures traditionally considered in the analysis of protocols are host and connection failures. The aim of this paper is to address fault tolerance for TS2PC4RS and its extension. A fault-tolerant protocol based on timeout and log records is proposed. The fault-tolerant protocol provides support for the host and connection failures that may occur during a transaction execution. The fault-tolerant mechanisms are used to meet the application domain business rules that guide the behavior of RESTful services. We describe the protocol using scenarios when failures occur.

In this paper, we consider the problem of enforcing opacity in systems modeled as partially-observed finite-state automata. We propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output of the system that changes the system's output behavior by inserting additional observable events. We define the property of ""i-enforceability"" that an insertion function needs to satisfy in order to enforce opacity. I-enforceability captures an insertion function's ability to respond to every system's observed behavior and to output only modified behaviors that look like existing non-secret behaviors. Given an insertion function, we provide an algorithm that verifies whether it is i-enforcing. More generally, given an opacity notion, we determine whether it is i-enforceable or not by constructing a structure called the ""All Insertion Structure"" (AIS). The AIS enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in a compact state transition structure. If a given opacity notion has been verified to be i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to synthesize an i-enforcing insertion function. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Rather than simply classifying all features in a scene as either dynamically moving foreground or long-lasting, stationary background, a temporal model is used to place each scene object in time relative to each other. Foreground objects that become stationary are registered as layers on top of the background layer. In this process of layer formation, the algorithm deals with ""fake objects"" created by moved background, and noise created by dynamic background and moving foreground objects. Objects that leave the scene are removed based on the occlusion reasoning among layers. The technique allows us to understand and visualize a scene with multiple objects entering, leaving, and occluding each other at different points in time. This scene understanding leads to a richer representation of temporal scene events than traditional foreground/background segmentation. The technique builds on a low-cost background modeling technique that makes it suitable for embedded, real-time platforms. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Scopus,Machine Vision and Applications,1175

In a policy-based management approach, administrators define user privileges as rules that determine the conditions and the extent of users' access rights. As rules become more complex, analytical skills are required to identify conflicts and interactions within the rules that comprise a system policy - especially when rules are stateful and depend on event histories. Without adequate tool support such an analysis is error-prone and expensive. In consequence, many policy specifications are inconsistent or conflicting that render the system insecure. The security of the system, however, does not only depend on the correct specification of the security policy, but in a large part also on the correct interpretation of those rules by the system's enforcement mechanism. In this paper, we show how policy rules can be formalized in Fusion Logic, a temporal logic for the specification of behavior of systems. A symbolic decision procedure for Fusion Logic based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) is provided and we introduce a novel technique for the construction of enforcement mechanisms of access control policy rules that uses a BDD encoded enforcement automaton based on input traces which reflect state changes in the system. We provide examples of verification of policy rules, such as absence of conflicts, and dynamic separation of duty and of the enforcement of policies using our prototype implementation (FLCheck) for which we detail the underlying theory. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Scopus,Formal Methods in System Design,1176

Furthermore, individuals can become better engaged in monitoring and managing their own health.

First, we propose an mHealth sensing protocol that provides strong security and privacy properties at the link layer, with low energy overhead, suitable for low-power sensors. The protocol uses three novel techniques: adaptive security, to dynamically modify transmission overhead; MAC striping, to make forgery difficult even for small-sized Message Authentication Codes; and asymmetric resource requirements, in recognition of the limited resources in tiny mHealth sensors.

Increasingly complex demands are placed on the software component systems, in particular relating to the dynamic properties. The emergence of such requirements has been gradually enforced by the practice of development and implementation of these systems, especially for information systems software. Just the information systems (robust IS) of different types require that target software meets their requirements. Among other things, we mean primarily the adaptive processes of different domains, high distributives due to the possibilities of the Internet 2.0, acceptance of high integrity of life domains (process, data and communications integrity), scalability, and flexible adaptation to process changes, a good context for external devices and transparent structure of the sub-process modules and architectural units. Of course, the target software of required qualities and the type robust cannot be a monolith. As commonly known, development of design toward information systems software has clearly come to the need for the software composition of completely autonomous, but cooperating architectural units that communicate with each other using messages of prescribed formats. Although for such units there were often used the so called subsystems and modules, see (Jac, Boo, Rumbo, 1998) and (Arlo, Neus, 2007), their abstraction being gradually enacted as the term component. In other words, the subsystems and modules are specific types of components. In (Kral, Žeml, 2000) and (Kral, Žeml, 2003) there are considered two types of target software of information systems. The first type - there are SWC (Software Components), composed of permanently available components, which are thought as services - Confederate software. The second type - SWA (Software Alliance), called semi Confederate, formed during the run-time of the software system and referred to as software alliance. In both of these mentioned publications there is delivered deep philosophy of relevant issues relating to SWC /SWA as creating copies of components (cloning), the establishment and destruction of components at software run-time (dynamic reconfiguration), cooperation of autonomous components, programmable management of components interface in depending on internal components functionality and customer requirements (functionality, security, versioning). Nevertheless, even today we can meet numerous cases of SWC /SWA existence, with a highly developed architecture that is accepting vast majority of these requests. On the other hand, in the development practice of component-based systems with a dynamic architecture (i.e. architecture with dynamic reconfiguration), and finally with a mobile architecture (i.e. architecture with dynamic component mobility) confirms the inadequacy of the design methods contained in UML 2.0. It proves especially the dissertation thesis (Rych, Weis, 2008). Software Engineering currently has two different approaches to systems SWC /SWA. The first approach is known as component-oriented software development CBD (Component based Development). According to (Szyper, 2002) that is a collection of CBD methodologies that are heavily focused on the setting up and software components re-usability within the architecture. Although CBD does not show high theoretical approach, nevertheless, it is classified under the general evolution of SDP (Software Development Process), see (Sommer, 2010) as one of its two dominant directions. From a structural point of view, a software system consists of self-contained, interoperable architectural units - components based on well-defined interfaces. Classical procedural objectoriented methodologies significantly do not use the component meta-models, based on which the target component systems are formed, then. Component meta-models describe the syntax, semantics of components. They are a system of rules for components, connectors and configuration. Component meta-models for dynamic and mobile architectures also describe the concept of rules for configuration changes (rules for reconfiguration). As well-known meta-models are now considered: Wright for static architecture, SOFA and Darvin for dynamic architecture and SOFA 2.0 for mobile architecture, see (Rych, Weis, 2008). The CBD approach verbally defines the basic terms as component (primitive /composite), interface, component system, configuration, reconfiguration, logical (structural) view, process view (behavioral), static component architecture, dynamic architecture, mobile architecture (fully dynamic architecture), see (IEEE Report, 2000) and (Crnk, Chaud, 2006). The CBD approach also presents several ADL languages (Architecture Description Languages) which are able to describe software architecture. The known languages are integration ACME and UML (Unified Modeling Language), see (Garl, Mon, Wil, 2000) and (UNIFEM, 2005). The second approach to SWC /SWA systems is formed on SOA, but this article does not deal with it consistently. SOA is a philosophy of architecture. SOA is not a methodology for the comprehensive development of the target software. Nevertheless, SOA successfully filled the role of software design philosophy and on the other hand, also gave an important concept linking software components and their architectural units - business services. SOA understands any software as a Component System of a business service and solved life components in it. The physical implementation of components is given by a Web services platform. A certain lack of SOA is its weak link to the business processes that are a universally recognized platform for business activities and the source for the creation of enterprise services. This paper deals with a specific activity in the CBD, i.e. the integration of the concept of componentbased system into an advanced procedural, object-oriented methodology (Arlo, Neust, 2007), (Kan, Muller, 2005), ( Krutch, 2003) for problem domains with double-layer process logic. There is indicated an integration method, based on a certain meta-model (Applying of the Component system Development in object Methodology) and leading to the component system formation. The mentioned meta-model is divided into partial workflows that are located in different stages of a classic object process-based methodology. Into account there are taken the consistency of the input and output artifacts in working practices of the meta-model and mentioned object methodology. This paper focuses on static component systems that are starting to explore dynamic and mobile component systems. In addition, in the contribution the component system is understood as a specific system, for its system properties and basic terms notation being used a set and graph and system algebra.",Scopus,Acta Universitatis Agriculturae et Silviculturae Mendelianae Brunensis,1179

Writing string manipulation code for input validation and sanitization is an error-prone process leading to many vulnerabilities in real-world web applications. Automata-based static string analysis techniques can be used to automatically compute vulnerability signatures (represented as automata) that characterize all the inputs that can exploit a vulnerability. However, there are several factors that limit the applicability of static string analysis techniques in general: 1) undesirability of static string analysis requires the use of approximations leading to false positives, 2) static string analysis tools do not handle all string operations, 3) dynamic nature of the scripting languages makes static analysis difficult. In this paper, we show that vulnerability signatures computed for deliberately insecure web applications (developed for demonstrating different types of vulnerabilities) can be used to generate test cases for other applications. Given a vulnerability signature represented as an automaton, we present algorithms for test case generation based on state, transition, and path coverage. These automatically generated test cases can be used to test applications that are not analyzable statically, and to discover attack strings that demonstrate how the vulnerabilities can be exploited. © 2014 IEEE.",Scopus,"Proceedings - IEEE 7th International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation, ICST 2014",1180

This paper presents a cyber security design approach that addresses cyber attacks that include modification of operator displays used for support in managing software controlled automated systems. This class of problems is especially important because our nation's critical infrastructures include such systems. In addition, many other systems, such as surveillance systems, navigation systems, and communications systems, are candidates for such solutions as they continue to become more and more automated. The suggested design approach builds upon fault-tolerant and automatic control system techniques that, with important and necessary modifications, are the basis for providing improved cyber security. In particular, the appropriate combination of diversely redundant security designs coupled with system dynamics models and state estimation techniques provide a potential means for detecting purposeful adjustments to operator displays. This paper provides a theoretical approach for designing such solutions and a corresponding set of examples with simulation-based results. In addition, the paper includes a discussion of important implementation requirements for greater assurance of such physical system security solutions. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Scopus,Systems Engineering,1182

Cloud computing is user-centric, and provides end users with leasing service. Guaranteeing the security of user data needs careful consideration before cloud computing is widely applied in business. Virtualization provides a new approach to solve the traditional security problems and can be taken as the underlying infrastructure of cloud computing. In this paper, we propose an intrusion prevention system, VMFence, in a virtualization-based cloud computing environment, which is used to monitor network flow and file integrity in real time, and provide a network defense and file integrity protection as well. Due to the dynamicity of the virtual machine, the detection process varies with the state of the virtual machine. The state transition of the virtual machine is described via Definite Finite Automata (DFA). We have implemented VMFence on an open-source virtual machine monitor platform - Xen. The experimental results show our proposed method is effective and it brings acceptable overhead. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Scopus,Journal of Supercomputing,1183

Determining the state of a power system is crucial and requirements for real-time decision making in power system security assessment demand low dimensionality and low computational time. This paper investigates the benefits of using feature selection based on mutual information in power system state classification with machine learning. The AdaBoost algorithm is used for classification based on large training datasets and feature selection is applied in order to reduce their dimensionality. The selection is implemented as a filter in the pre-processing stage of AdaBoost and uses genetic algorithms to perform the search with the fitness function computed based on mutual information. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE New England 39-bus network and a comparison between the learning algorithm performances with and without feature selection is provided. Results for different genetic algorithm parameters are also presented. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,Scopus,Computers and Mathematics with Applications,1186

In particular, we investigate techniques to synthesize a controller implementing a fully controllable target behavior by suitably coordinating available partially controllable behaviors that are to execute within a shared, fully observable, but partially predictable (i.e., non-deterministic), environment. Both behaviors and environment are represented as arbitrary finite state transition systems. The technique we propose is directly based on the idea that the controller job is to coordinate the concurrent execution of the available behaviors so as to ""mimic"" the target behavior. To this end, we exploit a variant of the formal notion of simulation to formally capture the notion of ""mimicking"", and we show that the technique proposed is sound and complete, optimal with respect to computational complexity, and robust for different kind of system failures. In addition, we demonstrate that the technique is well suited for highly efficient implementation based on synthesis by model checking technologies, by relating the problem to that of finding a winning strategy in a special safety game and explaining how to actually solve it using an existing verification tool. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the state transition model of vulnerability in the network based on semi-Markov process is proposed at first. Once events are triggered by an attacker's action or system response, the current states of the vulnerabilities are known. Then we calculate the transition probabilities of the vulnerability from the current state to security failure state. Furthermore in order to improve accuracy of our algorithms, we adjust the probabilities that they exploit the vulnerability according to the attacker's skill level. In the light of the preconditions and post-conditions of vulnerabilities in the network, attack graph is built to visualize security situation in real time. Subsequently, we predict attack path, recognize attack intention and estimate the impact through analysis of attack graph. These help administrators to insight into intrusion steps, determine security state and assess threat. Finally testing in a network shows that this method is reasonable and feasible, and can undertake tremendous analysis task to facilitate administrators' work. © 2013 SPIE.",Scopus,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,1188

In particular, one unsolved problem is to ensure that customers data protection policies are honored, regardless of where the data is physically stored and how often it is accessed, modified, and duplicated. This issue calls for two requirements to be satisfied. First, data should be managed in accordance to both owners' preferences and to the local regulations that may apply. Second, although multiple copies may exist, a consistent view across copies should be maintained. Toward addressing these issues, in this work we propose innovative policy enforcement techniques for adaptive sharing of users' outsourced data. We introduce the notion of autonomous self-controlling objects (SCO), that by means of object-oriented programming techniques, encapsulate sensitive resources and assure their protection by means of adaptive security policies of various granularity, and synchronization protocols. Through extensive evaluation, we show that our approach is effective and efficiently manages multiple data copies.

In this paper, attack patterns are analysed in the field of software engineering, and Bayesian Networks is applied to construct attack networks topology, to find the dependencies of attack patterns. It helps to find the vulnerable points, locate the path of security threats effectively, and predict probable attacks reasonably. We use multi-variant statistical analysis for the attack networks, and factor analysis is applied to reduce the relevance. In Dirichlet distribution, the state transition distribution of each attack node is calculated to detect and predict the security threats. In order to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the approach, buffer flow is chosen as the analysis domain, and 14 attack patterns are selected for the experiments.

First, transport routes are divided into smaller route segments. Second, likelihood scores of security-related accidents in which dangerous freight is involved and possibly causing fatalities in the surrounding population, are determined per route segment. Third, the consequences of accident scenarios (using reference products and spatial plans) are calculated in terms of the number of people within the 1% lethality distance of the accident center. Fourth, using these likelihood scores and consequence figures, transport route security risk levels are determined. Fifth, transshipment risks are considered for determining the final transport route security risk levels. This leads to a multi-modal user-friendly security threat assessment tool which can be used by policy makers as well as by industrialists (shippers or Logistics Service Providers). The generic method allows for comparing the security risk levels of the different route segments and routes of transportation of hazardous goods and for taking countermeasures from a uni-modal as well as from a multi-modal perspective. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,Transport Policy,1195

In these schemes, a quorum of at least (d≤n) servers needs to act upon a message to produce the result (decrypted value or signature), while corrupting less than d servers maintains the scheme's security. For about two decades, extensive study was dedicated to this subject, which created a number of notable results. So far, most practical threshold signatures, where servers act non-interactively, were analyzed in the limited static corruption model (where the adversary chooses which servers will be corrupted at the system's initialization stage). Existing threshold encryption schemes that withstand the strongest combination of adaptive malicious corruptions (allowing the adversary to corrupt servers at any time based on its complete view), and chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA) all require interaction (in the non-idealized model) and attempts to remedy this problem resulted only in relaxed schemes. The same is true for threshold signatures secure under chosen-message attacks (CMA). To date (for about 10 years), it has been open whether there are non-interactive threshold schemes providing the highest security (namely, CCA-secure encryption and CMA-secure signature) with scalable shares (i.e., as short as the original key) and adaptive security. This paper answers this question affirmatively by presenting such efficient decryption and signature schemes within a unified algebraic framework. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Despite of all the hype surrounding the cloud, enterprise customers are still reluctant to deploy their business in the cloud. This study proposes a security framework that provides security as a service for cloud applications. This framework provides security as a single-tier or multi-tier based on the application's demand. Moreover, these tiers are enabled to change dynamically making the entire security system less predictable. The behavior of this framework is designed to be customizable based on the application's importance and is localized. This design will help the cloud in adverse situations of threats because the threats will also be localized and will not pose a threat to the entire cloud. In a cloud where there are heterogeneous asset systems, a single security system would be too costly for certain applications and if there is less security then the vulnerability factor of some applications like financial and military applications will shoot up. This consideration is incorporated within the framework which enables security levels based on the importance of the assets of the services provided by the cloud and their respective clients. The framework was tested and the results were positive. ©Medwell Journals, 2012.",Scopus,Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences,1202

The disadvantage of this approach is that if there is no malicious activity, the user has to redo all of the work in her actual workspace since there is no easy way to commit (i.e., merge) only the benign updates within the VM back to the host environment. In this work, we develop a VM commitment system called Secom to automatically eliminate malicious state changes when merging the contents of an OS-level VM to the host. Secom consists of three steps: grouping state changes into clusters, distinguishing between benign and malicious clusters, and committing benign clusters. Secom has three novel features. First, instead of relying on a huge volume of log data, it leverages OS-level information flow and malware behavior information to recognize malicious changes. As a result, the approach imposes a smaller performance overhead. Second, different from existing intrusion detection and recovery systems that detect compromised OS objects one by one, Secom classifies objects into clusters and then identifies malicious objects on a cluster by cluster basis. Third, to reduce the false-positive rate when identifying malicious clusters, it simultaneously considers two malware behaviors that are of different types and the origin of the processes that exhibit these behaviors, rather than considers a single behavior alone as done by existing malware detection methods. We have successfully implemented Secom on the feather-weight virtual machine system, a Windows-based OS-level virtualization system. Experiments show that the prototype can effectively eliminate malicious state changes while committing a VM with small performance degradation. Moreover, compared with the commercial antimalware tools, the Secom prototype has a smaller number of false negatives and thus can more thoroughly clean up malware side effects. In addition, the number of false positives of the Secom prototype is also lower than that achieved by the online behavior-based approach of the commercial tools. © 2013 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,1203

However, there has been little study on how to specify and utilize timing diagrams in practice. Given sequence diagrams and state machine diagrams with MARTE annotations, we propose a systematic way to construct timing diagrams with MARTE annotations. To get well-formed models, we check timing constraints and consistency of the input UML/MARTE models. We present checking criteria for well-formed UML/MARTE models and systematic transformation rules.

Many entities from various administrative domains orchestrate such sessions. Faunus decouples the entities that specify the session from entities that activate and manage them. It restricts the operations to specific agents using capabilities. It unifies the specification and management operations through its naming system. Each Faunus name is persistent and globally unique. A collection of attributes are attached to each name. Together, they represent a collection of services that form a collaboration session. Anyone can create a name; the creator has full read and write privileges that can be delegated to others. With the proper capability, anyone can modify session attributes between an active and inactive state. Though the system is designed for Internet scale deployments, the security model for providing and revoking capabilities currently assumes an Intranet style deployment.

S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to check the effectiveness of maintenance carried out in nuclear plants. MR was consolidated in the U.S. in 1996. MR classifies Structures, System or Components (SSC) into two categories: Category (a)(2), the SSCs that reach the intended performance demonstrate that preventive maintenance is being appropriately performed, and category (a)(1), which stands for the SSCs that do not fulfill category (a)(1), and must have established goals, so that the discrepancies can be revised and then return to Category (a)(2). The purpose of this paper is to present a model that can be implemented in a personal computer, which allows the reliability analysis of nuclear power plant safety systems to be performed, starting from a state transition diagram, typically employed in Markovian reliability analyses. The classical Markovian model will not apply if at least one of the transition rates in the state transition diagram is time-dependent, due to equipment aging. To overcome this difficulty, the model is recast into a Markovian model by means of supplementary variables. The algorithm developed for this purpose also estimates the necessary parameters for the reliability analysis, starting from crude failure information available from the plant and using goodness of fit statistical tests for the most commonly employed probability distributions.

As more and more smart cameras are deployed for surveillance tasks across the globe, an efficient background modeling technique is required that balances accuracy, speed, and power. Due to its high parallel computational characteristics, robust adaptive background modeling has been implemented on GPUs with significant performance improvements over CPUs. However, these implementations are infeasible in embedded applications due to the high power ratings of the targeted general-purpose GPU platforms. We propose implementing a fast, adaptive background modeling algorithm on a low-power integrated GPU, the NVIDIA ION, with thermal design power (TDP) of only 12 watts. This paper focuses on how data and thread-level parallelism is exploited and memory access patterns are optimized to target this algorithm to a low-power GPU.

In the case of threshold public-key encryption, at least t ≤ n servers need to contribute to the decryption process. A threshold primitive is said robust if no coalition of t malicious servers can prevent remaining honest servers from successfully completing private key operations. So far, most practical non-interactive threshold cryptosystems, where no interactive conversation is required among decryption servers, were only proved secure against static corruptions. In the adaptive corruption scenario (where the adversary can corrupt servers at any time, based on its complete view), all existing robust threshold encryption schemes that also resist chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA) till recently require interaction in the decryption phase. A specific method (in composite order groups) for getting rid of interaction was recently suggested, leaving the question of more generic frameworks and constructions with better security and better flexibility (i.e., compatibility with distributed key generation). This paper describes a general construction of adaptively secure robust non-interactive threshold cryptosystems with chosen-ciphertext security. We define the notion of all-but-one perfectly sound threshold hash proof systems that can be seen as (threshold) hash proof systems with publicly verifiable and simulation-sound proofs. We show that this notion generically implies threshold cryptosystems combining the aforementioned properties. Then, we provide efficient instantiations under well-studied assumptions in bilinear groups (e.g., in such groups of prime order). These instantiations have a tighter security proof and are indeed compatible with distributed key generation protocols. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1213

However, further use of this framework is limited due to the following reasons. Firstly, it is difficult to build comprehensive and rigorous models for complex network structures by the state-based game model. Secondly, solving and extending the dynamic behaviors of participators of the network are nearly impossible, because of the complexity of state transitions. Last but not least, general game model is not able to describe and analyze specific events and behaviors in some kinds of networks, like enterprise networks. In this paper, we propose a new modeling paradigm (stochastic game net, or SGN) for stochastic games representation with Petri nets. Based on our graphical tool, stochastic game problems can be described clearly, and the model can be solved and extended easily. Moreover, this paper puts forth a series of methods for modeling and analyzing the competitive game by SGN, which is the main contribution of this work. Our achievements are applied to the security analysis for enterprise networks. The analysis results prove the powerful ability of our achievements in solving the complicated and dynamic game problems.

In this paper, a new systems engineering focused approach for mitigating such risks is described. This approach involves the development of a security architectural formulation that integrates a set of reusable security services as an architectural solution that is an embedded component of the system to be protected. The System-Aware architectural approach embeds security components into the system to be protected. The architecture includes services that (1) collect and assess real-time security relevant measurements from the system being protected, (2) perform security analysis on those measurements, and (3) execute system security control actions as required. This architectural formulation results in a defense that is referred to as System-Aware Cyber Security. This includes (1) the integration of a diverse set of dynamically interchangeable redundant subsystems involving hardware and software components provided from multiple vendors to significantly increase the difficulty for adversaries by avoiding a monoculture environment, (2) the development of subsystems that are capable of rapidly changing their attack surface through hardware and software reconfiguration (configuration hopping) in response to perceived threats, (3) data consistency checking services (e.g., intelligent voting mechanisms) for isolating faults and permitting moving surface control actions to avoid operations in a compromised configuration, and (4) forensic analysis techniques for rapid post-attack categorization of whether a given fault is more likely the result of an infected embedded hardware or software component (i.e., cyber attack) or a natural failure. In this paper we present these key elements of the System-Aware Cyber Security architecture and show, including an application example, how they can be integrated to mitigate the risks of insider and supply chain attacks. In addition, this paper outlines an initial vision for a security analysis framework to compare alternative System-Aware security architectures.

State recovery attack on stream cipher attempts to recover the hidden internal state by observing the keystream. RC4 is a very widely used commercial stream cipher that has a huge internal state. No known state recovery attack on RC4 is feasible in practice and the best so far has a complexity of 2241 (Maximov et al., CRYPTO 2008). In this paper, we take a different approach to the problem. RC4 has a secret index j of size one byte. We perform a combinatorial analysis of the complexity of RC4 state recovery under the assumption that the values of j are known for several rounds. This assumption of knowledge of j is reasonable under some attack models, such as fault analysis, cache analysis, side channel attacks etc. Our objective is not to devise an unconditional full state recovery attack on RC4, but to investigate how much information of j leaks how much information of the internal state. In the process, we reveal a nice combinatorial structure of RC4 evolution and establish certain interesting results related to the complexity of state recovery. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1220

One is using multiple PINs, namely Stored-PIN, Install-PIN, and Update-PIN, which allows providing different security-level services to diverse applets and/or users that have different security requirements. The other is applying cryptographic algorithms to make a PIN setting and verification activity more trustworthy.

The main idea behind the proposed system is to transform the conventional passive way of accidents management to an active way of eliminating the potential safety hazards arising in vehicle operations. Specifically, the proposed system involves equipping each fleet vehicle with an OBD (on-board device) to obtain real-time data on the vehicle's operating state, such as position, speed and direction. The collected data are sent to the fleet operations control center through wireless communication network, which can in turn send warnings or alerts to the driver had any incorrect maneuver or impending hazards been detected. This paper provides a detailed discussion about the architecture, components, and functionality of the system. The proposed safety monitoring system has been implemented and field tested in Chongqing, China, which has demonstrated its effectiveness in gathering valuable operational data and reducing vehicle road accidents. © 2011 ASCE.",Scopus,"ICTIS 2011: Multimodal Approach to Sustained Transportation System Development - Information, Technology, Implementation - Proceedings of the 1st Int.

Comprehensive detection of these Trojans during post-manufacturing test has been shown to be extremely difficult. Hence, it is important to develop design techniques that provide effective countermeasures against hardware Trojans by either preventing Trojan attacks or facilitating detection during test. Obfuscation is a technique that is conventionally employed to prevent piracy of software and hardware intellectual property (IP). In this work, we propose a novel application of key-based circuit structure and functionality obfuscation to achieve protection against hardware Trojans triggered by rare internal circuit conditions. The proposed obfuscation scheme is based on judicious modification of the state transition function, which creates two distinct functional modes: normal and obfuscated. A circuit transitions from the obfuscated to the normal mode only upon application of a specific input sequence, which defines the key. We show that it provides security against Trojan attacks in two ways: (1) it makes some inserted Trojans benign, i.e. they become effective only in the obfuscated mode; and (2) it prevents an adversary from exploiting the true rare events in a circuit to insert hard-to-detect Trojans. The proposed design methodology can thus achieve simultaneous protection from hardware Trojans and hardware IP piracy. Besides protecting ICs against Trojan attacks in foundry, we show that it can also protect against malicious modifications by untrusted computer-aided design (CAD) tools in both SoC and FPGA design flows. Simulation results for a set of benchmark circuits show that the scheme is capable of achieving high levels of security against Trojan attacks at modest area, power and delay overhead. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Scopus,Journal of Electronic Testing: Theory and Applications (JETTA),1227

CaPaS utilises an adaptive security control mechanism to adjust for varying workload conditions initiated by client-issued disk requests as well as security requirements and contains a cache partitioning scheme, a response-time estimator, and an adaptive security quality controller. The CaPaS algorithm solves a non-linear optimisation problem to increase the quality of security of disk requests in cluster storage systems while ensuring the disk requests to be completed within their desired response times. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been tested with the newly defined performance indicators on a cluster storage system including CaPaS, eight cryptographic and seven integrity services. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the CaPaS algorithm improves the overall system performance enormously over two traditional baseline cache management algorithms. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Scopus,International Journal of High Performance Systems Architecture,1231

Given a set of access control policies, a general safety requirement in such a system is to determine whether a desirable property is satisfied in all the reachable states. Such an analysis calls for the use of formal verification techniques. While formal analysis on traditional Role Based Access Control (RBAC) has been done to some extent, recent extensions to RBAC lack such an analysis. In this paper, we consider the temporal RBAC extensions and propose a formal technique using timed automata to perform security analysis by analyzing both safety and liveness properties. Using safety properties one ensures that something bad never happens while liveness properties show that some good state is also achieved. GTRBAC is a well accepted generalized temporal RBAC model which can handle a wide range of temporal constraints while specifying different access control policies. Analysis of such a model involves a process of mapping a GTRBAC based system into a state transition system. Different reduction rules are proposed to simplify the modeling process depending upon the constraints supported by the system. The effect of different constraints on the modeling process is also studied. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Scopus,Computers and Security,1236

The query interface, implemented with WS-* Web services, enables business applications to consume and share data within and across companies, to form a global network of independent EPCIS instances. However, the interface limits the application space to the rather powerful platforms which understand WS-* Web services. In this paper we propose seamlessly integrating this network into the Web by designing a RESTful (REpresentational State Transfer) architecture for the EPCIS. Using this approach, each query, tagged object, location or RFID reader gets a unique URL that can be linked to, exchanged in emails, browsed for, bookmarked, etc. Additionally, this paradigm shift allows Web languages like HTML and JavaScript to directly use RFID data to fast-prototype light-weight applications such as mobile applications or Web mashups. We illustrate these benefits with a JavaScript mashup platform that integrates several services on the Web (e.g., Twitter, Wikipedia, etc.) with RFID data to allow managers along the supply chain and customers to get comprehensive data about their products. ©2010 IEEE.",Scopus,"2010 Internet of Things, IoT 2010",1240

In this study, a real-time speech recognizer based on a Hidden Markov Network (HM-Net) was incorporated into the proposed system.

Serving a mobile user automatically by sensing his/her locations in an indoor environment is considered as a challenge. However, indoor localization cannot be carried out effectively using the Global Positioning System (GPS). In recent years, the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in locating a mobile object in an indoor environment has become popular. Some physical features have also been discussed to solve localization in WSNs. In this paper, we inquire into received signal strength indication (RSSI)-based solutions and propose a new localization scheme called the closer tracking algorithm (CTA) for indoor localization. Under the proposed CTA, a mechanism on mode-change is designed to switch automatically between the optimal approximately closer approach (ACA) and the real-time tracking (RTT) method according to pre-tuned thresholds. Furthermore, we design a mechanism to move reference nodes dynamically to reduce the uncovered area of the ACA for increasing the estimation accuracy. We evaluate the proposed CTA using ZigBee CC2431 modules. The experimental results show that the proposed CTA can determine the position accurately with an error distance less than 0.9 m. At the same time, the CTA scheme has at least 87% precision when the distance is less than 0.9 m. The proposed CTA can select an adaptive mode properly to improve the localization accuracy with high confidence. Moreover, the experimental results also show that the accuracy can be improved by the deployment and movement of reference nodes. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Scopus,International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering,1242

Although a variety of parallel disk systems were developed, most existing disk systems lack a means to adaptively control the quality of security for dynamically changing workloads. We address this gap in disk technology by designing, implementing, and evaluating a quality of security control framework for parallel disk systems, or ASPAD for short, that makes it possible for parallel disk systems to adapt to changing security requirements and workload conditions. The ASPAD framework comprises four major components, namely, a security service middleware, a dynamic data-partitioning mechanism, a response time estimator, and an adaptive security quality controller. The framework is conducive to adaptively and expeditiously determining security services for requests submitted to a parallel disk system in a way to improve security of the disk system while making an effort to guarantee desired response times of the requests. We conduct extensive experiments to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed ASPAD framework. Empirical results show that ASPAD significantly improves the overall performance of parallel disk systems over the same disk systems without using the ASPAD framework. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Mobile devices with multi-mode interfaces can access heterogeneous wireless networks, such as wireless local area network (WLAN), worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) network and third generation (3G) network. In heterogeneous wireless networks, different network provides different network capability, transmission range, data rate, access cost, security policy and quality of service. Therefore, a ubiquitous access aims to provide users intelligent human-centric context-aware handoff mechanism in heterogeneous wireless networks at anytime anywhere is gradually become an important issue. Optimal handoff planning in heterogeneous wireless networks considers the needs of users, accessing service and the surrounding context. However, most of existing handoff mechanisms only considered few contexts that lead to not able to select the most suitable network for individual user. In this paper, we propose a human-centric context-aware solution to access most appropriate network that satisfies individual user's requirement, fulfills seamless data transmission and reduces handoff delay. We develop two integrated approaches for context-awareness handoff planning mechanisms, namely MADM approach and GA approach. The MADM approach contains initial process and decision process. Initial process weights context by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method while decision process selects the most appropriate network by Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The GA approach uses Genetic Algorithm to minimize handoff under given QoS constraints. Performance of proposed mechanisms is evaluated under different services with different QoS considerations. Our simulation results show that both mechanisms are able to derive a proper network handoff plan which guarantees QoS requirements and reduces delay, jitter, and number of handoffs. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1250

Challenges include heterogeneity of hardware, software, and communication protocols, variability of resource limitations and varying wireless channel quality. In this scenario, security becomes a major concern for mobile users and applications. Security requirements for each application are different, as well as the hardware capabilities of each device. To make things worse, wireless medium conditions may change dramatically with time, incurring great impact on performance and QoS guarantees for the application. Currently, most of the security solutions for mobile devices use a static set of algorithms and protocols for services such as cryptography and hashes. In this work we propose a security service, which works as a middleware, with the ability to dynamically change the security protocols used between two peers. These changes can occur based on variations on wireless medium parameters and system resource usage, available hardware resources, application-defined QoS metrics, and desired data ""security levels"". We compare our solution to some widespread static security protocols, demonstrate how our middleware is able to adapt itself over different conditions of medium and system, and how it can provide a performance gain in the execution of cryptographic primitives, through the use of data semantics. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Scopus,Journal of Network and Computer Applications,1251

The amount of information produced by such dynamic analyses, in terms of scenarios and probability distributions of the occurring events, is very broad and usually calls for a significant effort in the post-processing phase. In an attempt to retrieve and organize this information, the present paper presents an approach for identifying and grouping the scenarios resulting from a dynamic system safety analysis. The aim is to single out the principal patterns of system evolution with respect not only to the final system states but also to the time of events and to the process evolution. Due to the burden of the analysis, this is often overlooked in dynamic safety analyses, which mainly focus on the system states at the end of the scenarios with little consideration given to the actual evolution of the system towards these states. Monte Carlo simulation is exploited for generating stochastic scenarios that are then grouped by combining information from the end state, the sequence of events and the physical behavior of the process variables. The grouping is based on possibilistic clustering classification. The approach has been tested on scenarios produced by dynamic simulation of a chemical batch reactor of literature in which a highly exothermic process is worked out. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Rigorous and designer-friendly methodologies for modeling and analyzing secure software are highly desirable. A formal method for software development, however, often suffers from a gap between the rigidity of the method and the informal nature of system requirements. To narrow this gap, this paper presents a UML-based framework for modeling and analyzing security threats (i.e. potential security attacks) rigorously and visually. We model the intended functions of a software application with UML statechart diagrams and the security threats with sequence diagrams, respectively. Statechart diagrams are automatically converted into a graph transformation system, which has a well-established theoretical foundation. Method invocations in a sequence diagram of a security threat are interpreted as a sequence of paired graph transformations. Therefore, the analysis of a security threat is conducted through simulating the state transitions from an initial state to a final state triggered by method invocations. In our approach, designers directly work with UML diagrams to visually model system behaviors and security threats while threats can still be rigorously analyzed based on graph transformation. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Scopus,International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering,1258

In this work we devise a novel behavior-based malware detection system named pBMDS, which adopts a probabilistic approach through correlating user inputs with system calls to detect anomalous activities in cellphones. pBMDS observes unique behaviors of the mobile phone applications and the operating users on input and output constrained devices, and leverages a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to learn application and user behaviors from two major aspects: process state transitions and user operational patterns. Built on these, pBDMS identifies behavioral differences between malware and human users. Through extensive experiments on major smartphone platforms, we show that pBMDS can be easily deployed to existing smartphone hardware and it achieves high detection accuracy and low false positive rates in protecting major applications in smartphones.

In recent articles, we conducted nonparametric analyses and Weibull fits of satellite and satellite subsystems reliability for 1584 Earth-orbiting satellites launched between January 1990 and October 2008. In this paper, we extend our investigation of failures of satellites and satellite subsystems beyond the binary concept of reliability to the analysis of their anomalies and multi-state failures. In reliability analysis, the system or subsystem under study is considered to be either in an operational or failed state; multi-state failure analysis introduces ""degraded states"" or partial failures, and thus provides more insights through finer resolution into the degradation behavior of an item and its progression towards complete failure. The database used for the statistical analysis in the present work identifies five states for each satellite subsystem: three degraded states, one fully operational state, and one failed state (complete failure). Because our dataset is right-censored, we calculate the nonparametric probability of transitioning between states for each satellite subsystem with the Kaplan-Meier estimator, and we derive confidence intervals for each probability of transitioning between states. We then conduct parametric Weibull fits of these probabilities using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach. After validating the results, we compare the reliability versus multi-state failure analyses of three satellite subsystems: the thruster/fuel; the telemetry, tracking, and control (TTC); and the gyro/sensor/reaction wheel subsystems. The results are particularly revealing of the insights that can be gleaned from multi-state failure analysis and the deficiencies, or blind spots, of the traditional reliability analysis. In addition to the specific results provided here, which should prove particularly useful to the space industry, this work highlights the importance of conducting, beyond the traditional reliability analysis, multi-state failure analysis of any engineering system when seeking to understand its failure behavior. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is assumed that the equipment's unobservable degradation state transition follows a Markov chain, and we model it using a hidden Markov model. The Bayes' rule is used to determine the probability of being in a certain degradation state at each observation moment. Cox's time-dependent proportional hazards model is considered to model the equipment's failure rate. This paper addresses two main problems: the problem of imperfect observations, and the problem of taking into account the whole history of observations. Two numerical examples are presented. © 2010 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Reliability,1264

In this paper, we propose an innovative remote attestation framework called DR@FT for efficiently measuring a target system based on an information flow-based integrity model. With this model, the high integrity processes of a system are first verified through measurements and these processes are then protected from accesses initiated by low integrity processes. Also, our framework verifies the latest state changes in a dynamic system instead of considering the entire system information. In addition, we adopt a graph-based method to represent integrity violations with a ranked violation graph, which supports intuitive reasoning of attestation results. Our experiments and performance evaluation demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of DR@FT. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1265

However, security policies are often carefully tightened during system design-time, and the large number of service dependencies in a system architecture makes their dynamic adaptation difficult. The enforcement of a single response rule requires performing multiple configuration changes on multiple services. This paper formally describes a Service Dependency Framework (SDF) in order to assist the response process in selecting the policy enforcement points (PEPs) capable of applying a dynamic response rule. It automatically derives elementary access rules from the generic access control, either allowed or denied by the dynamic response policy, so they can be locally managed by local PEPs. SDF introduces a requires/provides model of service dependencies. It models the service architecture in a modular way, and thus provides both extensibility and reusability of model components. SDF is defined using the Architecture Analysis and Design Language, which provides formal concepts for modeling system architectures. This paper presents a systematic treatment of the dependency model which aims to apply policy rules while minimizing configuration changes and reducing resource consumption. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1267

The non-satisfaction of time may have important consequences for both security and performance points of view. For automated systems with level of security, the verification of time requirements is an essential part of the process validation system. In this paper, we are laying the foundations for a new and systematic approach for the verification of discrete event systems with time constraints. The contribution of this approach is threefold: first, unlike existing approaches, it allows for the verification of several requirements at once. Therefore, the approach is generic because we focus on developing mechanisms that take into account different types of requirements rather than the system to be verified. Finally, the implementation of the approach is almost as systematic because the verification tools we are developing are based on the instantiation of patterns. These patterns are designed on the basis of a classification of temporal requirements that we have established. The concepts of parallelism and hierarchy which characterize the Stocharts formalism compared to other state-transitions models help us build the foundations of our approach.

Using bilinear maps, we then construct broadcast encryption systems that are semi-statically secure in the standard model and have constant-size ciphertexts. Our semi-static constructions work when the number of indices or iDentifiers in the system is polynomial in the security parameter. For iDentity-based broadcast encryption, where the number of potential indices or iDentifiers may be exponential, we present the first adaptively secure system with sublinear ciphertexts.

The rich history of the development of countermeasures for specific MSCA, e.g., DDoS, worms, has shown that it is the special spatio-temporal characteristic that causes the prevention, detection and response of MSCA to be challenging. Instead of focusing on fine-grained specific attack analysis, this paper presents a model from high-level viewpoint, aiming at characterizing the behaviors of MSCA in terms of key spatio-temporal properties for better understanding and more effective design of countermeasures. The model is specifically developed for two purposes: First, it sheds light on the fundamental elements of an MSCA by examining its spatio-temporal related observations, and formulating attacker behavior as a reward-directed Markov decision process; Second, it assists security administrator in identifying the potential causal relationship of system vulnerabilities based on the reports of deployed security tools, so as to suggest appropriate actions. Taking the model as a basis, two meta-heuristic algorithms are designed. Specifically, attackers nondeterministic trail search (ANTS) is developed for approximately searching attack schemes with the minimum attack cost, and attacker's pivots discovery via backward searching (APD-BS) is designed for examining the pivots of attack schemes, namely the key observations associated with system state transitions during an attack. Finally, a proof-of-concept validation is conducted using a simulated enterprise network under DDoS attack, which is a typical MSCA variant. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In MDA, the reusability of models is improved as well as the traceability of requirements. Agent-oriented model-driven architecture (AMDA) associates adaptive agents with a business-oriented interaction model and lets agents dynamically interpret their behaviour from the continuously maintained model via which the current business needs are deployed at runtime. The continuous re-interpretation rather than discrete re-transformation of models means immediate requirements deployment after re-configuration, no system down time being required to affect changes and results in a development process that is oriented to business experts rather than developers. Adopting the adaptive agent model, an AMDA paradigm, we put forward a security-aware model-driven mechanism by using an extension of the role-based access control (RBAC) model. For this purpose, the concept of agent role proposed in agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) is integrated with the one proposed in RBAC. Agent duties are specified in an interaction model and describe the roles that agents can play to fulfil their functional responsibilities. Agent rights are specified in a security policy rule model attached to the interaction model and describe constraints upon agent capabilities caused by their associated social roles. The role-based interaction and policy-driven model incorporates both agent rights and duties. Hence, functional requirements and non-functional security constraint requirements are put together, related by the concept of role. Consequently, agents can continuously use the re-configurable model to play their roles in order to fulfil their responsibilities, and at the same time respect the security constraints. The major contribution from the approach is a method for building adaptive and secure MAS, following model-driven architecture.

Testing such applications requires significant effort. Manual testing alone is often impractical, so testers also rely on automated testing techniques. However, current automated testing techniques may produce false positives (or false negatives) even in a perfectly working system because the outcome of a test case depends on the state of the database which changes over time as data is inserted and deleted. The Automatic Database Tester (AutoDBT) generates functional test cases that account for database updates. AutoDBT takes as input a model of the application and a set of testing criteria. The model consists of a state transition diagram that shows how users navigate pages, a data specification that captures how data flows, and an update specification that shows how the database is updated. AutoDBT generates guard queries to determine whether the database is in a state conducive to performing and evaluating tests. AutoDBT also generates partial oracles to help validate whether a back-end database is updated correctly during testing.

The idea suggests that a client computer, protected by a light-weight firewall, could establish diversified authenticated communication channels, controlled and accounted by ""legal"" states of the smart card. The program of a smart card is state-oriented or a state machine, which defines a chain of events involving various state transitions. The ""legal"" states of a smart card program are defined to be legal to communicate with surfing targets. A predefined Access Control List (ACL), stored in the same card, is necessary. An ACL is a sequential list of permit or deny statements that apply to addresses or upper-layer protocols. The proposed firewall decides acceptance or rejection messages by matching the current state of the card program and the ACL. In addition, a complete surfing account for tracing back is recorded. It is a by-product of the smart card authentication. The proposed Card-Aided Firewall framework is implemented to demonstrate its effectiveness. The implementation is done at the driver level.

To enhance the effectiveness of robotic assets and their interaction with human operators, smart sensors are required to give more autonomous function to robotic platforms. Biologically inspired sensors are an essential part of this development of autonomous behavior and can increase both capability and performance of robotic systems. Smart, biologically inspired acoustic sensors have the potential to extend autonomous capabilities of roboticplatforms to include sniper detection, vehicle tracking, personnel detection, and general acoustic monitoring. The key to enabling these capabilities is biomimetic acoustic processing using a time domain processing method based on the neural structures of the mammalian auditory system. These biologically inspired algorithms replicate the extremely adaptive processing of the auditory system yielding high sensitivity over broad dynamic range. The algorithms provide tremendous robustness in noisy and echoic spaces; properties necessary for autonomous function in real world acoustic environments. These biomimetic acoustic algorithms also provide highly accurate localization of both persistent and transient sounds over a wide frequency range, using baselines on the order of only inches. A specialized smart sensor has been developed to interface with an iRobot Packbot® platform specifically to enhance its autonomous behaviors in response to personnel and gunfire. The low power, highly parallel biomimetic processor, in conjunction with a biomimetic vestibular system (discussed in the companion paper), has shown the system's autonomous response to gunfire in complicated acoustic environments to be highly effective. © 2009 SPIE.",Scopus,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,1294

Many of us that surf the Internet from home with a 56 kbps modem think that it is slow and a cell phone only uses 9.6 kbps so WAP has to take the lesser bandwidth into consideration. For this reason, this study proposed a flexible and reliable system to be implemented by using the characteristic of agents ""mobile agent"" through wireless application protocol for identification of distributed Intruder. The problem appears when the limitation of data transfer when the distributed systems are used (which includes the heterogeneous database) through internet. For this reason the suggested approach will be the solution to the problem of WAP for mobile agent. Approach: The purpose of this study was to present the ability for dispatch mobile agent from a host to carry out operations directly to the remote point of interest, thus agent's scans provide an appropriate response which is faster than a hierarchical IDS that communicates with a central coordinator based elsewhere on the network. Results: The methodology was used in order to understand the mobile agent mechanism and will introduce the distributed computing mechanisms that are intended for large scale distributed systems. Since the distributed security agent models system was built using mobile agent and net, this will develop small applications for data stores, like sequential query language server. The method used the algorithms built refer to each part of the structure and the rules that implemented (users and the security agent system roles). The result was simulating the intended for business roles for both commercial and government modules, which included the solution to the problem and to architecture to be more flexible and reliable. Conclusion/Recommendations: One of main conclusion for the mobile agent used WAP protocol: To make this protocol secure when transmit the messages in the distributed system using agents chrematistics and Interaction with security agent is multi-mode providing hassle-free access to the user. Security agent alerted the users based on their alert rules. This study had new approach and idea in implementation, also presented the ability to dispatch mobile agent from a host to carry out operations directly to the remote point of interest, thus agent's scans provide an appropriate response which is faster than a hierarchical IDS that communicates with a central coordinator based elsewhere on the network. © 2009 Science Publications.",Scopus,Journal of Computer Science,1296

In a light-trail, the optical shutters at the start node and the end node are configured to be in OFF state and the optical shutters at the intermediate nodes are configured to be in ON state. Thus, an optical bus is formed, allowing traffic multiplexing without the state change of any optical shutter. This, however, limits the system throughput and also makes it impossible to implement a fully distributed medium access control (MAC) protocol to assure quality of service (QoS) in a light-trail. With the recent development on ultrafast optical shutter, we propose an improved light-trail architecture, called opportunistic hyperchannel in this paper. In an opportunistic hyperchannel, an intermediate node can dynamically control its optical shutter which makes it possible to design a fully distributed QoS assuring MAC protocol. We then present a QoS assuring distributed dynamic scheduling protocol, namely, minimum source round robin (minSrcRR) protocol, for opportunistic hyperchannels. Theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed QoS assuring protocol and the worst-case delay bound are also derived in this paper. The simulation results quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of opportunistic hyperchannels and the effectiveness of minSrcRR protocol. © 2009 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,1298

This problem occurs due to implicit sharing in operating systems, and it can be especially severe for persistent state. In particular, the file system provides a single namespace that when compromised can have cascading effects on the entire system, making intrusion analysis and recovery a time-consuming and error-prone process. In this paper, we present Solitude, an application-level isolation and recovery system that is designed to both limit the effects of attacks and simplify the post-intrusion recovery process. Solitude uses a copy-on-write filesystem to provide a transparent, restricted privilege isolation environment for running untrusted applications, and it uses an explicit file sharing mechanism across the isolation environments that limits attack propagation without compromising functionality. Solitude provides two modes of recovery. If a sandboxed application proves to be untrustworthy, a course-grained recovery method allows easily removing the footprint of the software. However, if a user mistakenly moves malicious files to the trusted environment via explicit file sharing, then Solitude uses data dependency tracking to allow fine-grained recovery.

It is useful in many settings, including proactive security, adaptive security, forward security, and intrusion resilience. Protocols for all these settings typically assume the ability to perfectly erase information. Unfortunately, as amply demonstrated in the systems literature, perfect erasures are hard to implement in practice. We propose a model of partial erasures where erasure instructions leave almost all the data erased intact, thus giving the honest players only a limited capability for disposing of old data. Nonetheless, we provide a general compiler that transforms any secure protocol using perfect erasures into one that maintains the same security properties when only partial erasures are available. The key idea is a new redundant representation of secret data which can still be computed on, and yet is rendered useless when partially erased. We prove that any such a compiler must incur a cost in additional storage, and that our compiler is near optimal in terms of its storage overhead. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1301

This is because the requirements for the respective computer usage are different in the network and security policies. In this paper, a new destination addressing control system scheme (DACS Scheme) for the university network services is shown. The DACS Scheme performs the network services efficiently through the communication management of a client. As the characteristic of DACS Scheme, only the setup modification is required by a system administrator, when the configuration change is needed in the network server. Then, the setup modification is unnecessary by a customer, which shows a merit for both a system administrator and a customer. However, there is a problem to be solved. In existing DACS Scheme, it is assumed that DACS Client for controlling the communication must be implemented on all clients. If the client without DACS Client is connected to the network, each network server can be accessed from the client. Therefore, in this paper, secure DACS Scheme with the function to prevent the communication from the client without DACS Client is proposed and examined. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

For a given sequence of crucial commands of an intrusion, all the possible derived sequences as an intrusion scenario can be generated by means of the model. We may also use the model to detect the attacks from different cooperating attackers and the attacks from one attacker in different login sessions.

At first glance the variety of data gathered by a multitude of traditional and non-traditional Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors should allow decision makers to better understand their environment and the threat. However, a number of factors tend to mitigate this advantage. Incompatible data formats, bandwidth limitations, sensor persistence and revisit rates, and multi-level security are but a few of the technical challenges that preclude end users from being able to take full advantage of the sensor information. Further, as the amount of sensor data increases, real challenges emerge in identifying the most salient pieces of information, fusing that with other relevant sensor modalities, and rapidly moving this information in a presentation format that does not overwhelm the decision maker. At the same time, the number of end users needing access to this information is also increasing. Boyd's OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) applies throughout the decision chain from the strategic to the operational and tactical levels. In this light a decision maker could be a pilot of an F-35 Lightning II making a targeting decision, a Marine Company Commander securing a city, an Army squad leader trying to quell a civil disturbance among rival tribes, or members of the strategy cell at a Combined/Joint Air Operations Center developing the strategic plan for the C/JFACC. While specific information requirements and available bandwidth constraints will differ among each of these end users, the overall need for timely, relevant, accurate, and trusted information to achieve and maintain situational awareness remains the same. It was this problem space of improving information access to increase the situational awareness of decision makers that spawned the Layered Sensing vision. Layered Sensing is an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate initiative to bring fused, multi-source, multi-spectral, multi-dimensional (e.g. cultural, environmental, etc.) information to the decision-maker consistent with their needs regardless of location with the goal of improving the situational awareness of the decision maker. In essence Layered Sensing is a Sensing Oriented Architecture where the customer can provide or request information tailored to their needs in order to facilitate situational awareness. While Layered Sensing began as a potential solution to a warfighter problem, it has applicability outside the Department of Defense. For example, the Department of Homeland Security is one federal agency that could potentially face many of the same information challenges in operations as diverse as providing a common operating picture during a post-Katrina type reconstitution scenario or in fusing multi-source and multi-mode data (e.g. HUMINT, electronic intercepts, etc) in order to track or capture a suspected terrorist. Although the Layered Sensing concept was initially developed in the AFRL Sensors Directorate, the technical challenges associated with Layered Sensing will require the efforts of all AFRL Technical Directorates and the involvement of other DoD entities. Sensor improvements in size, weight, and power as well as continued developments in the field of autonomic networks, trust, high capacity communications, cultural modeling, data semantics, and cognition will be needed to fully execute this vision. In addition, the participation of sister service laboratories will be critical if we are to take advantage of other services' information systems such as the Army's Future Combat System that could be a user and provider of information to the Layered Sensing architecture and information space. While the eventual architecture of Layered Sensing is still undefined, we have begun to define some its attributes. Key among these attributes is the requirement for autonomic, trusted sensors and networks. In austere areas of the world or in a disaster zone we may not have access to readily available broadband, high capacity networks or long-haul commercial communications.

That is, they react to channel errors by simply retransmitting erroneous packets and do not proactively decide whether or not to transmit a packet in a given slot based on past channel conditions. Clearly, ARQ protocols operating in this mode are not energy efficient. For example, continuously retransmitting erroneous packets when the wireless channel is in deep fade would cause significant wastage of transmission energy. In this paper, we present a stochastic learning automaton-based wireless channel state aware ARQ protocol. The learning automaton learns to predict and track the time-varying wireless channel conditions based on past observations. A Markov chain model for the channel state transitions is used. No a priori knowledge about the state transition probabilities is required by this predictor. Stochastic convergence of the learning algorithm is proved. The proposed ARQ protocol utilizes the predictions to compute transmission/retransmission policies in an online fashion. No pilot (training) symbols are used by the protocol for channel state prediction thereby avoiding any energy wastage due to the transmission of these symbols. Simulation results show that depending on the channel memory significant energy savings can be attained when compared with standard ARQ protocols. We also discuss the transmission energy versus delay trade-off. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Scopus,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,1308

To avoid SPDoS attack, a framework is presented to design a resource-aware self-adaptive network security provisioning scheme for the resource constraint MANET. With the support of the offline optimal secure protocol selection module and the online self-adaptive security control module, the framework is capable of deploying different combinations of secure protocols to satisfy different security needs at different conditions for different applications. Consequently, the proposed self-adaptive security provisioning achieves the maximum overall network security services and network performance services, without causing the SPDoS attack. Moreover, it provides additional security capability via security services hopping. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2007.",Scopus,IET Information Security,1309

The model is based on a finite-Markovian process. The methodology presented here is unique and simple to determine the state probabilities of susceptible populations in general. Although the emphasis is on a computer-based infection model, it can be applied to various types of epidemiology. The simple epidemic model [D. Daley, J. Gani, Epidemic Modeling, an Introduction, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1999.] has its limitations; it has only one state transition, which goes from susceptible to infected, and hence infected forever. This paper will show that the states are recurrent. A healthy but susceptible node can become infected by a virus, can then become a transmitter, and can also return to a healthy state. Efficient mitigation approaches and optimal system reliability depend on accurately determined parameters for failure-rate and repair-rate of attacked systems. The model presented here is useful in determining state transition dynamics for estimating infection and recovery rates of susceptible systems. Thus, our model can complement the existing worm propagation models for bias-corrections and fine-tuning of worm's dynamics. Another major contribution of this paper is to promote further studies in determining performance criteria regarding the costs of mitigation and the improved system availability. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Most of these techniques are based on informal models and due to this, analysis is often subjective and success is dependent on the skill of the practitioner.

This technique is based on formal models of the system under development and can be applied on requirements, design and code to get assurance of the respective artifact satisfying a wide variety of functional requirements. In this paper, we present a case study of applying formal verification methods for doing safety analysis of requirements of a generic aircraft flight control system. Flight control system is broadly specified in two parts: mode transition logic part specifies which mode the system is in and represents the function performed by the flight control system. In each mode, certain control laws are executed to implement the various flight control functions. We used a particular technique in formal verification namely that of model checking for analysis.

Common primitives which are used for symmetric key algorithms have been thoroughly analysed by the hardware and cryptography community to design more efficient implementations. A side product of this development and a common fact for cryptographers is the strong modularisation of block ciphers and the similarities therein. This contribution shows how an efficient combination framework can exploit these characteristics to support a large variety of cryptographic primitives on resource restricted hardware. We present a collection of basic building blocks, which can be combined dynamically to implement various primitives. With the high energy consumption of radio transmission in mind the presented work takes a different direction from existing approaches which aim at highly optimised primitives. By exploiting the modular redundancy within existing block ciphers the presented approach can adapt to a node context and choose the primitives optimal for a specific task in terms of security requirements, and resource consumption. This work additionally discusses how this modularity enables a device to efficiently update existing and install new primitives, and how it may adapt implementations to resource restricted execution environments. © 2007 ICST.",Scopus,"Proceedings of the Bio-Inspired Models of Network, Information, and Computing Systems, Bionetics 2007",1314

Therefore, sensor networks need to support an authentication service for sensor identity and message transmission. Furthermore, intrusion detection and prevention schemes are always integrated in sensor security appliances so that they can enhance network security by discovering malicious or compromised nodes. This study provides adaptive security modules to improve secure communication of cluster-based sensor networks. A dynamic authentication scheme in the proposed primary security module enables existing nodes to authenticate new incoming nodes, triggering the establishment of secure links and broadcast authentication between neighboring nodes. This primary security design prevents intrusion from external malicious nodes using the authentication scheme. For advanced security design, the proposed intrusion detection module can exclude internal compromised nodes, which contains alarm return, trust evaluation, and black/white lists schemes. This study adopts the two above mentioned modules to achieve secure communication in cluster-based sensor networks when the network lifetime is divided into multiple cluster rounds. Finally, the security analysis results indicate that the proposed design can prevent and detect malicious nodes with a high probability of success by cluster-based and neighbor monitor mechanisms. According to the performance evaluation results, the proposed security modules cause low storage, computation, and communication overhead to sensor nodes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We present an efficient incremental checkpointing mechanism. It requires to record only the state changes and not the complete state. After the creation of a check-point, state changes are logged incrementally as records in memory, with which an application can spontaneously roll back later. This incrementalism allows us to implement checkpointing with high performance. Only small constant time is required for checkpoint creation and state recording. Rollback requires linear time in the number of recorded state changes, which is bounded by the number of state variables times the number of checkpoints. We implement a Java source transformer that automatically converts an existing application into a behavior-preserving one with checkpointing functionality.

Universal composition (UC) provides a very attractive framework for the modular design of cryptographic protocols that captures both static and adaptive security formulations. In the UC framework, one can design protocols in hybrid worlds that allow access to idealized functionalities and then apply the universal composition theorem to obtain more concrete protocol instances. The zero-knowledge (ZK) ideal functionality is one of the most useful sub-protocols in modular cryptographic design. Given an adaptively secure protocol in the ideal ZK-hybrid-world do we always need an adaptively secure realization of the ZK functionality in order to preserve adaptive security under composition? In this work, perhaps surprisingly, we find that this is not so and in fact there are useful protocol instances that we can ""trade static security for adaptive security."" We investigate the above setting, by introducing a weakened ZK ideal functionality, called the ideal leaking-zero-knowledge functionality (LZK) that leaks some information about the witness to the adversary in a certain prescribed way. We show that while LZK is interchangeable to ZK against static adversaries, ZK is more stringent when adaptive adversaries are considered. We then proceed to characterize a class of protocols in the hybrid-ZK-world that can be ""transported"" to the LZK-hybrid-world without forfeiting their security against adaptive adversaries. Our results demonstrate that in such settings a static protocol realization of ZK is sufficient for ensuring adaptive security for the parent hybrid protocol something that enables simplified and substantially more efficient UC realizations of such protocols. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1322

It uses the vulnerability index (VI) and margin index (MI) to evaluate the vulnerability and security of the individual system parts, as well as the whole system during an operating state. It identifies the vulnerable parts of the power system using the topology processing and operation index methods. For a given disturbance, it calculates the power flow, evaluates the vulnerability and security, identifies the vulnerable part, finds the transmission line overload and bus voltage problems, and predicts the possible successive events. The approach defines the control means using the following methods for early detection and prevention of cascading events: network contribution factor (NCF), generator distribution factor (GDF), load distribution factor (LDF), and selected minimum load shedding (SMLS). This approach has been tested using the IEEE RTS-96 24-bus system and promising results have been obtained. The proposed approach allows the power system operator to detect initial stages of cascading events and assert actions that will prevent such events from unfolding. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Over the last decades, software and systems engineering expanded to a comprehensive engineering discipline. Nowadays software engineering comprises requirements engineering, modeling and design, implementation and testing, installation and maintenance. Software engineering proved to be a key technology; its mastery determines the functioning of modern infrastructures and consumer products. Software development has matured from heuristic practice to an engineering discipline. In the meantime, software engineers can benefit from a solid stock of basic research addressing modeling and design techniques for sequential, concurrent, distributed, and timed systems. Software quality and reliability, security and safety, the management of change, reuse and integration pose new requirements to the practice of software engineering. A major challenge consists in integrating the developed theories into a coherent engineering framework accepted by practitioners. Software engineers face different system views described by a variety of graphical and textual formalisms. Software development must safely bridge the system views on different levels of abstraction ranging from high-level specifications to executable code. The system views center around the data model, the communication model, the state transition model, and the trace model. The data model describes the data structure in an abstract or concrete way. The communication model manifests how a component interacts with the environment by exchanging messages. The state transition model describes an abstract implementation where an input affects an update of the internal state and a possible output. The trace model characterizes the operational behaviour of the system by a set of possible runs composed of atomic actions. The lecture classifies different system models and addresses discrete interactive systems with asynchronous communication in greater detail. We present a model for interactive components along with transformations refining the component's behaviour, interface and state. The approach supports the design of elementary components for processing, memory, control and transmission. Moreover, it allows a structural and behavioural description of component-based software architectures and services. Finally we relate the approach to pragmatic engineering techniques focusing on UML-oriented state transition diagrams and sequence diagrams.",Scopus,"Proceedings - SNPD 2007: Eighth ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking, and Parallel/Distributed Computing",1325

In order to increase the system's survivability a multilevel protection against the destructive factors can be applied to its subsystems.

Consider checking a red-black tree implementation. Traditional software model checkers systematically generate all red-black tree states (within some given bounds) and check every red-black tree operation (such as insert, delete, or lookup) on every red-black tree state. Our key idea is as follows. As our checker checks a red-black tree operation o on a red-black tree state s, it uses program analysis techniques to identify other red-black tree states s' 1, s'2, ..., s'k on which the operation o behaves similarly. Our analyses guarantee that if o executes correctly on s, then o will execute correctly on every s'i. Our checker therefore does not need to check o on any s'i once it checks o on s. It thus safely prunes those state transitions from its search space, while still achieving complete test coverage within the bounded domain. Our preliminary results show orders of magnitude improvement over previous approaches. We believe our techniques can make model checking significantly faster, and thus enable checking of much larger programs and complex program properties than currently possible.

Examples of such environments include disaster relief and war zone. In such situations, system resources may need re-configuration or operational modes may change, necessitating a change of policies. For the system to continue functioning, the policies must be changed immediately and the modified policies automatically enforced. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem-we consider real-time update of access control policies in the context of a database system. In our model, a database consists of a set of objects that are read and updated through transactions. Access to the data objects are controlled by access control policies which are stored in the form of policy objects. We consider an environment in which different kinds of transactions execute concurrently; some of these may be transactions updating policy objects. Updating policy objects while they are deployed can lead to potential security problems. We propose algorithms that not only prevent such security problems, but also ensure serializable execution of transactions. The algorithms differ on the degree of concurrency provided and the kinds of policies each can update. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Scopus,Information Systems,1333

Compared to internetworking schemes between UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems) and WLAN [3-4], the scheme from [1] has relatively low overhead and latencies because WLAN and MANET are physically and logically similar to each other. However, the mode switching algorithm proposed in [1] for internetworking only considers signal strength and determines handoff, and mobile nodes following a zigzag course in pollution area may frequently perform handoff at short intervals. Furthermore, [1] employs mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) at base, which brings still high delay on handoff and overhead due to signal message exchange. In this paper, we present optimized internetworking scheme between WLAN and MANET, modified from [1]. To settle ping-pong handoff, we propose adaptive mode switching algorithm. HMIPv6 is employed for IP connectivity and mobility service in WLAN, which solves some shortcomings, such as high handoff overhead and vulnerable security from MIPv6. For routing in MANET, OLSR is employed, which operates with current IP protocol compatibly with no change or modification.

The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) has specified a powerful security layer, the WTLS. In this paper, a VLSI architecture for the implementation of the WTLS integrity unit is proposed. The proposed architecture is reconfigurable in the sense that operates in three different modes: as Keyed-Hash Authentication Code (HMAC), as SHA-1 and MD5 hash functions, according to WTLS specifications. This multi-mode operation is achieved due to the reconfigurable applied design technique in the proposed architecture, which keeps the allocated area resources at a minimized level. The proposed architecture achieves high speed performance, due to the pipeline designed architecture. Especially, SHA-1 operation achieved throughput is equal to 1,7Gbps, while MD5 operation mode bit rate is equal to 2,1 Gbps. The proposed architecture has been integrated by using VHDL and has been synthesized placed and routed in an FPGA device. Comparisons with related hash functions implementations have been done in terms of throughput, operating frequency, allocated area and Area-Delay product. The achieved performance of the SHA-1 operation mode is better at about 14-42 times compared with the other conventional works. In addition, MD5 performance is superior to the other works at about 6-18 times, in all of the cases. The proposed Integrity Unit is a very trustful and powerful solution for the WTLS layer. In addition, it can be integrated in security systems which are used for the implementation networks for wireless protocols, with special needs of integrity in data transmission. © Ohmsha, Ltd. 2005.",Scopus,New Generation Computing,1351

The selection of input signals for ANN is influenced by the operating state of the system and the contingency in question which determines the extent of line power limit violations. In an attempt to attain perfection in PI prediction, suitable architecture and topology for the network is investigated.

The tight space limits of Java smart cards make the implementation non-trivial. A potential application is to ensure that applets down-loaded off the internet conform to personalised security permissions stored on the Java card using a security policy encoded in multi-modal logic. In particular, modal logic may be useful to ensure that previously checked “trust” relationships between pre-existing multiple applets on a Java card are not broken by the addition of a new applet. That is, by using multi-modal logic to express notions of permissions and obligations, we can turn the security check into an on-board theorem proving task. Our theorem prover itself could be down-loaded “just in time” to perform the check, and then deleted to free up space on the card once the check has been completed. Our work is thus a “proof of principle” for the application of formal logic to the security of multi-application Java cards. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1358

Firstly, the attacks are characterized by applying Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and these characterized intrusions are analyzed according to their state changes by utilizing transient state analysis. Subsequently, the software rejuvenation methods are performed by killing the intruders' processes in their tracks, halting abuse before it happens, shutting down unauthorized connection, and responding and restarting in real time. These slogans will really frustrate and deter the attacks, as the attacker can't make their progress.

A conventional centralized solution breaks down when the security servers are destroyed by the enemies. In this paper we design and evaluate a security framework for multilevel ad hoc wireless networks with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In battlefields, the framework adapts to the contingent damages on the network infrastructure. Depending on the availability of the network infrastructure, our design is composed of two modes. In infrastructure mode, security services, specifically the authentication services, are implemented on UAVs that feature low overhead and flexible managements. When the UAVs fail or are destroyed, our system seamlessly switches to infrastructureless mode, a backup mechanism that maintains comparable security services among the surviving units. In the infrastructureless mode, the security services are localized to each node's vicinity to comply with the ad hoc communication mechanism in the scenario. We study the instantiation of these two modes and the transitions between them. Our implementation and simulation measurements confirm the effectiveness of our design.

Each state can be characterized by a performance rate, which is the quantitative measure of a system's ability to perform its task. Both the impact of external factors (attack) and internal causes (failures) affect system survivability, which is determined as the probability of meeting a given demand. In order to increase the system 's survivability a multilevel protection is applied to its subsystems. This means that a subsystem and its inner level of protection are in turn protected by the protection of an outer level. This double-protected subsystem has its outer protection and so forth. In such systems, the protected subsystems can be destroyed only if all of the levels of their protection are destroyed. Each level of protection can be destroyed only if all of the outer levels of protection are destroyed. In such systems, different protections play different roles in providing for the system's survivability. The evaluation of the relative influence of the protections' survivability on the survivability of the entire system provides useful information about the importance of these protections. The protection survivability importance index is introduced in order to evaluate this influence and an algorithm for evaluating the index is presented. The relevancy of protection is also considered.

We ground our study in the context of a security scenario called ""A Line in the Sand"" and accordingly define the target, system, environment, and fault models. Based on the performance requirements of the scenario and the sensing, communication, energy, and computation ability of the sensor network, we explore the design space of sensors, signal processing algorithms, communications, networking, and middleware services.

The FCS provides the capability to stabilize and control the aircraft, while the FMS is responsible for flight planning and navigation. A clear trend in the aerospace industry is to place greater reliance on software systems, and many FCS and FMS subsystems are implemented primarily in software. For example, within the FCS is the Flight Guidance System (FGS) that generates roll and pitch guidance commands. Similarly, within the FMS is the Vertical Navigation (VNAV) function that acts like a third crew member in the cockpit, ordering mode change requests and resetting target altitude values to enable the aircraft to track the vertical flight plan. We have developed formal, executable models of the requirements for the mode logic of a FGS and for portions of the VNAV functionality. We have also conducted a comprehensive software safety analysis on the FGS mode logic model, and are completing the analysis of the VNAV model. This analysis uses as its starting point several ""traditional"" safety analysis techniques such as a Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA), a Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), and a Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA). However, we are also using formal methods techniques known as model checking and theorem proving to verify the presence of safety properties in the model. This paper summarizes the (now completed) safety analysis that was performed on the FGS model, and highlights the similarities and differences with the (still on-going) safety analysis of the FMS model. In particular, we summarize progress made to date in the use of formal methods to verify the presence of the required safety properties in the models themselves.",Scopus,IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine,1368

In this model, each state represents an impromptu condition that a system is presented, and the state is characterized by the historical context record and the internal action record. Each state transition in the model represents a context input. The whole finite state machine models the dynamicity of the situation-aware application software system that adjusts its own behavior according to the situation changes. The situation-aware requirement is application-specific, and each situation-aware requirement is corresponding to an FSM. This model is useful in the mobile application software development: it can be used to verify the validness of the situation-aware requirement; it can be used to generate test cases that represent the situation changes a system may experience in a mobile environment.

Then, it was relatively simple to identify our intelligence collection targets. It was sometimes hard to collect the intelligence, but the targets were clear. Today we live in a world of asymmetries. The most serious asymmetric threat facing the United States today is terrorism; a threat characterized by collections of loosely organized people who operate in shadowy networks that are difficult to identify and define and whose goal is the destruction of our way of life. The intelligence collection targets are thousands of people whose identities and whereabouts we do not always know. If we are to preserve our national security, we must figure out a way of combating this threat. The solution is largely associated with information technology. We must become much more efficient and clever in the ways we use existing sources of data to find new sources of data, mine it for new information, generate context relevant information, make it widely available for collaborative analysis, convert it to knowledge and create actionable options for senior decision-makers. Also, we need a more systemic approach to the problem. A variety of tools, processes and procedures will be required to deal with this problem, however, to be effective, they must be integrated and harmonized within a system context built around a common architecture. In this paper, we will provide a broad overview of the Total Information Awareness (TU) program - a new counter terrorism initiative sponsored by the Information Awareness Office (MO) at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The TIA program will develop and integrate a variety of information technologies enabling early warning and understanding of terrorist activities and ultimately the preemption of terrorist attacks through collaborative decision making at the national security level. Examples of some of the key technologies needed for TIA include: entity and event detection and extraction, link discovery and pattern learning across space and time, human language exploitation including summarization and translation, biometrics and multi-modal techniques for human identification, various methods for privacy protection and policy formulation, and several prediction and estimation approaches to understand individual and group behavior and intent. TIA will also require concepts and methods for bringing users with diverse points of view together in a collaborative problem-solving environment, where they can have access to their relevant data sources, the use of discovery tools and the ability to exploit and quickly generate models for structured arguments that facilitate the presentation and vetting of competing hypotheses. © 2003 IEEE.",Scopus,IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings,1370

Secure OS based on Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the systems that reflect these techniques. The RBAC system controls access to system resources based on roles. Recently, many systems employ more fine-grained access control on system resources to enhance system security. However, this approach in access control level may cause unexpected problems, since most systems acquire system resources through system call that is hooked on kernel. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The proposed Autonomic Protection System (APS) supports fine-grained intrusion detection. It resides above Secure OS based on RBAC that provides general-grained access control. The system detects intrusions using security policy based on RBAC model. The system performs double checking for intrusions using positive and negative intrusion detection policy. Additionally, as one of active responses, the system supports the self-adaptation of security policy depending on various computing environments. Therefore, the system can detect intrusions more accurately and respond to the attacks actively and appropriately. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.",Scopus,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),1371

We propose the use of an infrastructure-based secure proxy architecture to bridge the gap between the capabilities of post-PC devices and the requirements of Internet services. By combining generic content and security transformation functions with service-specific rules, the architecture decouples device capabilities from service requirements and simplifies the addition of new devices and services. Security and protocol specifics are abstracted into reusable components. Additionally, the architecture offers the novel ability to deal with untrusted public Internet access points by providing fine-grain control over the content and functionality exposed to the end device, as well as support for using trusted and untrusted devices in tandem. Adding support for a deployed Internet service requires a few hundred lines of scraping scripts. Similarly, adding support for a new device requires a few hundred lines of stylesheets for the device format.

The method is flexible, allowing analysis of attacks from both outside and inside the network. It can analyze risks to a specific network asset, or examine the universe of possible consequences following a successful attack. The graph-based tool can identify the set of attack paths that have a high probability of success (or a low ""effort"" cost) for the attacker. The system could be used to test the effectiveness of making configuration changes, implementing an intrusion detection system, etc. The analysis system requires as input a database of common attacks, broken into atomic steps, specific network configuration and topology information, and an attacker profile. The attack information is ""matched"" with the network configuration information and an attacker profile to create a superset attack graph. Nodes identify a stage of attack, for example the class of machines the attacker has accessed and the user privilege level he or she has compromised. The arcs in the attack graph represent attacks or stages of attacks. By assigning probabilities of success on the arcs or costs representing level-of-effort for the attacker, various graph algorithms such as shortest-path algorithms can identify the attack paths with the highest probability of success. © 1999 ACM.",Scopus,Proceedings New Security Paradigms Workshop,1375

First, we introduce a method and its associated technique to model both real-Time tasks and the timeliness ensuring concern when tasks are executed in parallel. This approach is based on formal aspects of our real-Time tasks model and on the definition of the synchronized product operator on the tasks. Real-Time tasks are equivalent to their state-Transition diagrams and the operator allows us to compose the diagrams of a set of tasks to represent their interactions. The operator is then used to map the tasks to a system of linear constraints to determine the schedulability of the tasks and deduce a system load upper bound. An illustration of our technique on a safety critical study case is presented in which the timeliness property can be achieved for the real-Time set of tasks executed in parallel on the same processor.

Further, the mobile code environment is fluid, i.e. the programs and resources located on a host many change rapidly, necessitating an extensible security model. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a security infrastructure. The model is built around an event/response mechanism, in which a response is executed when a security-related event occurs. We support a fine-grained, conditional access control language, and enforce policies by instrumenting the bytecode of protected classes.

Since intrusion detection is performed in different domains (i.e., the network or the hosts) and in different operating environments (e.g., Linux, Solaris, or Windows NT), it is useful to have an extensible language that can be easily tailored to different target environments. STATL defines domain-independent features of attack scenarios and provides constructs for extending the language to describe attacks in particular domains and environments. The STATL language has been successfully used in describing both network-based and host-based attacks, and it has been tailored to very different environments, e.g., Sun Microsystems' Solaris and Microsoft's Windows NT. An implementation of the runtime support for the STATL language has been developed and a toolset of intrusion detection systems based on STATL has been implemented. The toolset was used in a recent intrusion detection evaluation effort, delivering very favorable results. This paper presents the details of the STATL syntax and its semantics. Real examples from both the host and network-based extensions of the language are also presented.",Scopus,Journal of Computer Security,1382

There are challenges in maintenance as well as keeping updated on minor upgrades and modifications. Production modes also change as facilities age, e.g. water production increases while oil/gas production decreases. The operational modes change from manual to automatic, often resulting in fewer operations personnel. How do you operate this safely and knowing where you are in relation to your ""operational envelope""? After several years in operation we experience that the assumptions made and precautionary measures taken in the engineering phase of the platform development are not often commonly shared knowledge. Vital technical ""history"" can also become obscured after some years of operation, often due to changing of personnel, cumbersome and voluminous documentation etc. An HSE Management System (HSE-MS) was established from first operation, but does it reflect all minor upgrades and modifications over time? This uncertainty resulted in a perceived increase of risk. This was the situation, which justified launching a project to define and assuring the technical integrity of an offshore platform. The presentation will provide examples of a successful revamp of the HSE-MS, leading to a fully integrated risk based MS.

It turns out that the power of an adaptive adversary is greatly affected by the amount of information gathered upon the corruption of a party. This amount of information models the extent to which uncorrupted parties are trusted to carry out instructions that cannot be externally verified, such as erasing records of past configurations. It has been shown that if the parties are trusted to erase such records, then adaptively secure computation can be carried out using known primitives. However, this total trust in parties may be unrealistic in many scenarios. An important question, open since 1986, is whether adaptively secure multi-party computation can be carried out in the ""insecure channel"" setting, even if no party is thoroughly trusted. Our main result is an affirmative resolution of this question for the case where even uncorrupted parties may deviate from the protocol by keeping record of all past configurations. We first propose a novel property of encryption protocols and show that if an encryption protocol enjoying this property is used, instead of a standard encryption scheme, then known constructions become adaptively secure. Next we construct, based on the standard RSA assumption, an encryption protocol that enjoys this property. © 1996 ACM.",Scopus,Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing,1384

The intention is to find a set of indicators which are well understood and informative enough for use in a power system control centre environment for dynamic security assessment (DSA). The protective system is included in the mathematical model of the power system. Current methods for DSA proposed in the literature ignore discrete devices such as the relays. It is the practice to update relay settings occasionally, depending on planned changes in the power system structure (new source, new load, new line, periodic checking). Thus the current operating state of the power system can be significantly different from the one for which the relay security are selected. The necessity for inclusion of relay models is illustrated by an example. For the dynamic security assessment of the power system it is not necessary to include all the relays present in the system. A set of relays which may trip for a given contingency can be isolated. This set is named the set of vulnerable relays and a procedure to identify them is proposed.

Mutual support and co-operation among nodes are prerequisites for performing functions in such networks. The scarcity of resources makes it economical for nodes to conserve their resources and misbehave by avoiding participation in the network. Therefore, a mechanism is required to detect and handle such misbehaving nodes and promote co-operation in the network. Existing techniques for handling misbehaving nodes focus only on their current behaviour without considering the antecedent behaviour of nodes. In real world, a node may dynamically change its behaviour in accordance to its requirements. Hence, an efficient mechanism is required for providing security against such misbehaviour. This paper proposes an Adaptive Security Model which contemplates the present as well as anterior behaviour of nodes for providing security against dynamic node behaviour. The adaptivity of the model is nested in its ability to requite well-behaving nodes and penalize misbehaving ones in conformity with their overall behaviour.

IBRS can be classified into unbounded IBRS and bounded IBRS, depending on whether to set a maximal revocation number (e.g., N) or not. Compared to unbounded IBRS, existing bounded IBRS schemes have the advantage of short ciphertexts, however, they cannot support an increase of N and have to fix a large N to provide the revocation. This compromises the computational efficiency, which is linear in N. To bridge this gap, we are interested in exploring whether N can be dynamic. Precisely, N is initially set as a small number and increased into a larger one when more than N identities are revoked, while this increase does not affect other non-revoked users in the system. In this paper, motivated by the security of bounded IBRS with a dynamic N, we define an enhanced security model, which allows the corruption of any polynomial number (e.g., n) of private keys, independent of N. It augments existing security models by running different challenges when n N, respectively. The enhanced security model suits both unbounded 1BRS and bounded IBRS with a general description that can be ``empty'' for unbounded IBRS or a special N for bounded IBRS. Then, we propose a scalable bounded IBRS scheme and are able to prove its security in an enhanced security model. The increase of N incurs no changing on all of the existing private keys and the only cost is a slight expansion of the master public keys. Our proposed scheme also has short ciphertexts and private keys, comparable to the state-of-the-art (bounded) IBRS schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Secure wireless communication channels and protocols for protecting the data and information sent to the cloud, and remote access to secure cloud services, are other important problems related to task scheduling and processing in dynamic MCC. In this paper, we developed a new security-aware task allocation model strategy in Mobile Cloud Computing. In this model, we define an allocation algorithm which generates an optimal and secure configuration of communication protocols in order to meet the specific data confidentiality requirements defined by end users. Resource utilization is predicted using Machine Learning methods, and the optimal secure service for task execution is selected. We developed a simulation environment (MocSecSim) for the evaluation of the algorithms proposed in several scenarios based on the users' requirements. The results of simulations and experiments have demonstrated that the model proposed significantly improves the level of security of calculations in comparison with a configuration where processing time and energy consumption are the main criteria for optimizing task allocation.",Web of Science,SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY,1399

The work in this paper presents a mechanism to detect adversaries for the IEEE 802.15.4 standard which is a central medium access protocol used in WSN-based IoT applications. The collisions and exhaustion attacks are detected based on a soft decision-based algorithm. In case the QoS of the network is compromised due to large data traffic, the proposed protocol adaptively varies the duty cycle of the IEEE 802.15.4.

The opportunity lies in the ability of SDN applications to express intelligent and agile threat mitigation logic against hostile flows, without the need for specialized inline hardware. However, the SDN community lacks a secure control-layer to manage the interactions between the application layer and the switch infrastructure (the data plane). There are no available SDN controllers that provide the key security features, trust models, and policy mediation logic, necessary to deploy multiple SDN applications into a highly sensitive computing environment. We propose the design of security extensions at the control layer to provide the security management and arbitration of conflicting flow rules that arise when multiple applications are deployed within the same network. We present a prototype of our design as a Security Enhanced version of the widely used OpenFlow Floodlight Controller, which we call SE-Floodlight. SE-Floodlight extends Floodlight with a security-enforcement kernel (SEK) layer, whose functions are also directly applicable to other OpenFlow controllers. The SEK adds a unique set of secure application management features, including an authentication service, role-based authorization, a permission model for mediating all configuration change requests to the data-plane, inline flow-rule conflict resolution, and a security audit service.

On this basis, the general in-formation flow is modeled through information mapping between measured state and control command.

To support more secret keys associated with nodes, it is often expected that the tree has a sufficiently large depth. This places a burden on employing it implicitly or explicitly in real world. In this work, we show how to compress linear-size public key down to constant-size public key and give our construction featuring constant-size public key in the standard model. We prove that our construction achieves an improved security, adaptive security, under the matrix decision Diffie-Hellman assumption, which is a generalization of standard k-Lin assumption.

Traditionally cryptographic methods were employed to secure networks but the demand of undesirable code size and processing time had given rise to trust-based schemes for addressing the misbehavior of attacks in the IoT networks. With reference to it, several trust-based schemes have been proposed by researchers. However, the prevailing schemes require high computational power and memory space; which weakens the network integrity and control. In this context, the paper presents a Light-weight Hidden Markov Model (L/W- HMT) for trust evaluation to alleviate the effect of compromised nodes and restricts the storage of unnecessary data to reduce overhead, memory, and energy consumption. This research work has presented a 2state HMM with Trusted state and compromised state together with essential and unessential output as observation state. Amount of packets forwarded, dropped, modified, and received are the parameters for state transition and emission matrices while the forward likelihood function evaluates the trust value of the node.

In this paper we present algorithms and automation tools for constructing discrete event controllers for complex networked systems that restrict the dynamic behavior of the system according to given specifications. In our previous work we have modeled dynamic system as a discrete event automaton whose open loop behavior is represented as a language L of strings generated with the alphabet Sigma of all possible atomic events that cause state transitions in the network. The controlled behavior is represented by a sublanguage K, contained in L, that restricts the behavior of the system according to the specifications of the controller. We have developed the algebraic structure of controllable sublanguages as perfect right partial ideals that satisfy a precontrollability condition.(1) In this paper we develop an iterative algorithm to take an ad hoc specification described using a natural language, and to formulate a complete specification that results in a controllable sublanguage. A supervisory controller modeled as an automaton that runs synchronously with the open loop system in the sense of Ramadge and Wonham(2) is automatically generated to restrict the behavior of the open loop system to the controllable sublanguage.

Many Android applications have malicious or abnormal behaviour: stealing private information, subscribing to unwanted paid services, consuming a large amount of resources on the device and displaying unwanted advertisements. Students learning security need to understand the behaviour of such applications. In this paper, we propose an infrastructure for collecting information pertaining to application behaviour at runtime and exposing the malicious and atypical actions performed by Android applications. The purpose of this infrastructure is to provide a meaningful learning experience to students, as they study malicious applications. The infrastructure includes collectors at every level of the operating system and the behaviour information includes: the consumed resources (CPU, memory), the exchanged messages (SMSs, phone calls, packets), the state changes of the communication channels (WiFi, 3G, Bluetooth, NFC). Behaviour information is sent periodically from the collectors to a native application and can be visualised through a Graphical User Interface, directly on the mobile device. Students are allowed to select any process in the system and investigate its behaviour in real time. They also can extract the behaviour information from the mobile device in order to perform statistical analysis on the data. Students are able compare the collected data for legitimate and malicious/abnormal applications and identify the malicious behaviour patterns. These patterns can be used to discover new malware, that is not yet detected by commercial antivirus solutions.

CyberX employs such diversity to modify the application implicit behavior at runtime utilizing autonomous execution elasticity and adaptability. Further, CyberX enhances application resilience against failures and attacks via multi-mode recovery and real-time, context- and situation-aware adjustment of shuffling and recovery policies. Using analysis and simulation, results show that CyberX-managed COA-based software systems can efficiently adapt to maintain the desired performance and resilience objectives even in hazardous, unstable environments at a reasonable overhead.",IEEE Xplore,"8th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom)",1421

Grzemba,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6328858,20120.0,IEEE Conferences,"In the last couple of years, it has become obvious that embedded systems are integral parts of our every day lives. This omnipresence as well as the wireless nature of many embedded applications give rise to the need for sophisticated security and privacy preserving mechanisms. Trusted Computing is a promising new approach for computer security in which a system should be permanently in a well-defined and therefore trustworthy state. The adaption of such concepts for embedded systems with application specific requirements and limitations can provide promising security benefits. Besides, both in the industrial and academical sector a trend has become apparent to develop chips which include programmable cores as well as system reconfigurable components. Resultant chips will not be a single part of an embedded system anymore but rather can be used for the development of a whole system. Thus, FPGAs have become integral parts of embedded computing platforms. The reconfigurability of FPGAs offers major advantages when using them for cryptographic applications and it is suggested that an adaptive hardware-based trust anchor can greatly enhance the overall security level of an embedded system. In this paper we propose a concept of how such an adaptive security module could be designed as well as some possible fields of application. A key focus of this ongoing research work is the development of a flexible FPGA-based security architecture.",IEEE Xplore,2012 International Conference on Applied Electronics,1422

Security threats and attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities have been shown to compromise patient safety by hampering essential functionality. This necessitates incorporating security from the very design of software. Isolation of software functionality into different modes and switching between them based on risk assessment, while maintaining a fail-safe mode ensuring device's essential functionality is a compelling design. Formal modeling is an essential ingredient for verification of such a design. Hence, in this paper, we formally model a trustworthy multi-modal framework for life-critical systems security and in turn safety. We formalize a multiple mode based software design approach of operation with a fail-safe mode that maintains critical functionality. We ensure trustworthyness by formalizing a composite risk model incorporated into the design for run-time risk assessment and management.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the Annual Simulation Symposium,1428

In this paper, we model a multi-modal design approach for risk assessment in medical devices and propose an adaptive remediation scheme to mitigate security threats. Our multi-modal approach is integrated into the hardware-software development with a middleware for interaction between the modes.

To this end, defenders can launch a cyber-forensic investigation, which discovers the techniques that the threat actors used in the incident. A fundamental challenge in such an investigation is prioritizing the investigation of particular techniques since the investigation of each technique requires time and effort, but forensic analysts cannot know which ones were actually used before investigating them. To ensure prompt discovery, it is imperative to provide decision support that can help forensic analysts with this prioritization. A recent study demonstrated that data-driven decision support, based on a dataset of prior incidents, can provide state-of-the-art prioritization. However, this data-driven approach, called DISCLOSE, is based on a heuristic that utilizes only a subset of the available information and does not approximate optimal decisions. To improve upon this heuristic, we introduce a principled approach for data-driven decision support for cyber-forensic investigations. We formulate the decision-support problem using a Markov decision process, whose states represent the states of a forensic investigation. To solve the decision problem, we propose a Monte Carlo tree search based method, which relies on a k-NN regression over prior incidents to estimate state-transition probabilities. We evaluate our proposed approach on multiple versions of the MITRE ATT&CK dataset, which is a knowledge base of adversarial techniques and tactics based on real-world cyber incidents, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms DISCLOSE in terms of techniques discovered per effort spent.

Given the rise of digitalization in nuclear power plants and the potentially hazardous consequences of a successful cyber-attack on nuclear power plants and similar safety-critical systems, it is imperative that research should be focused on industrial control system cyber-attack detection and mitigation. In this paper we explore the use of reinforcement learning to develop an autonomous cyber-attack response system for nuclear power plants, specifically the digital feedwater control system of a pressurized water reactor. The cyber-attacks are modeled as Stackelberg games between the defender i.e., the plant operator and the attacker. The system state transition probabilities are defined using probabilistic risk assessment. The optimal defender strategy is computed using multi-agent Q-learning, where the Stackelberg equilibrium over the current Q-values is used at every update. The advent of digital twins for nuclear power plants enables us to simulate a wide variety of cyber-attacks for as many instances as needed to fully train the reinforcement learning agents. © 2022 Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management, PSAM 2022.

Recently, the CPS field has been identified as a key area of research, and CPSs are expected to play a major role in the design and development of future systems. However, the mutual coordination and inter-dependence among cyber and physical components come at the price of increased vulnerability to failures and attacks. Hence, securing a CPS is extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to address the adaptive security in CPSs. First, we specify CPS on the basis of the CA-BRS (Control Agent and Bigraphical Reactive Systems) formalism, which combine agent and bigraphical reactive systems to deal with the virtual level (software), the physical level (execution machines and their environment) and the behavioural level (dynamics) of the CPS. The given formal model helps in answering several crucial modeling issues in CPS, such as the natural heterogeneity, the connected dynamics, the interaction between cyber and physical components and meanwhile, the non-functional properties as security and reliability. Then, this well defined specification of CPS is translated to BPMN (ISO/CEI 19510 standard of the OMG) in order to bring the formal model closer to the implementation. An illustrative example of a secure IT department in a smart factory is considered to consolidate our theoretical approach results. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Valve actuators as an example, sometimes offer data and insights that are left unmonitored by the plant control system. Often, the original installation of these devices involves wiring that is limited to power and control signaling. However, many instruments offer useful and detailed information about their health and operating state which can prove beneficial for maintenance planning purposes. By employing a predictive maintenance plan rather than a schedule-based approach, an instrument can indicate that repairs are warranted either sooner than typically planned, or even later. Earlier warning and subsequent action taken by maintenance personnel may reduce the number of unanticipated failures and avoid unplanned downtime, whereas an extended maintenance cycle would likely reduce overall maintenance costs and demand on resources. This presentation provides for an investigation of various data communication strategies, for applications where unmonitored information is available in intelligent instrumentation but is not currently being collected.

This paper proposes Canopy, a novel approach for detecting LSDDoS attacks by applying machine learning techniques to extract meaning from observed patterns of TCP state transitions. While existing works have presented techniques that successfully mitigate different examples of LSDDoS attacks, Canopy has uniquely shown the ability to mitigate a diverse set of LSDDoS attacks, including never-before-seen attacks, all while maintaining a low false positive rate. Canopy is able to detect and mitigate low-and-slow attacks accurately and quickly: our tests find that attacks are identified during 100% of test runs within 650 milliseconds. Server performance is restored quickly: in our experimental testbed, we find that clients’ experience is restored to normal within 7.5 seconds. During active attack mitigation, which only occurs during server performance degradation indicative of an attack, Canopy exhibits minimal erroneous mitigative action applied to benign clients as it achieves a precision of 99%. Finally, we show that Canopy’s capabilities generalize well to LSDDoS attacks not included in its training dataset, identifying never-before-seen attacks within 750 milliseconds.

Gen III reactor architectures are predominately digital, increasing the industrial cybersecurity threat landscape when compared with Gen II designs. Nuclear plant cyber and physical security organizations are tasked with protecting nuclear power plants against any action, intentional or accidental, that could lead to radiological release. Regulatory requirements for cybersecurity protection of digital communications and computer equipment associated with safety, security, emergency preparedness, and support systems critical to plant operations and safe reactor shutdown are included in applications for operating licenses in different countries. Cybersecurity for Gen III reactors entails the same methodologies used for Gen II reactors. The divergence between Gen II and Gen III cybersecurity is the number of digital assets requiring protection. Gen III units may have as many as double or triple the number of digital assets that Gen II reactors have. Additionally, instrumentation and control (I&C) configuration changes and significant modifications to control room architecture for Gen III models require detailed assessments to determine appropriate cybersecurity controls for protecting digital assets while not interfering with operations. Critical infrastructure malicious cyber actors have demonstrated their objectives of disrupting physical processes in Operational Technology (OT) environments through successful compromises such as power grid attacks, penetration and destruction of centrifuges in nuclear enrichment facilities, and other cyber-attacks. Therefore, cybersecurity defense of OT environments in Gen III nuclear power plants is essential in order to protect the public and the environment from potential radiological release that could result from a damaging cyber-attack. © 2018 PBNC 2018 - Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference.All Rights Reserved.",Scopus,PBNC 2018 - Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference,1440

Current practices focus on strategies for preventing cyber-attacks, while little research has been done on how to respond to cyber-attacks when they are detected. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach for responding to cyber-attacks on nuclear power plants. The interaction between the defender and the attacker is modeled as a two-player, nonzero-sum, stochastic game, which generalizes both Markov decision processes (MDP) and repeated games. We propose an approach for identifying system states and state transitions, and apply probabilistic risk assessment to obtain credible transition probabilities between system states under the action pair of defender and attacker. The Nash Equilibrium of the game provides the valid prediction of both players' actions because no single player can benefit from unilaterally deviating from the equilibrium policy if the other player adheres to his/hers, hence it provides the best response of the defender to cyber-attacks. Dynamic programming represents the long-term cumulative utility in a recursive form and we form an equivalent nonlinear program to derive the equilibrium. As a case study, the proposed approach is applied to a simplified benchmark digital feedwater control system. The modeling of the system is presented, and discussions on both the equilibrium policy and state values obtained are provided. © 2018 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC All Rights Reserved",Scopus,"11th Nuclear Plant Instrumentation, Control, and Human-Machine Interface Technologies, NPIC and HMIT 2019",1441

To address this problem, security experts have proposed local, internal inspection, known as Host-Based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS). This technique allows detection of malicious activity to occur at the endpoints - the individual hosts. This research proposes AHNSR: Active Host-based Network Security Response, which utilizes HIDS with Software Defined Networking (SDN) in order to enhance system security, allowing dynamic active response and reconstruction from a global network topology perspective. Vital to the operational architecture, SDN introduces new programming capabilities that resolve the rigid configurations of traditional networks. This is essential in an era of rapidly evolving threats that require unique and adaptive security defenses in both virtualized and enterprise environments. SDN-software security controls aim at providing access to legitimate users, protecting systems from attacks, and providing mitigation or countermeasures when attacks do occur. AHNSR is a complete and automated dynamic security solution, starting with alert generation and ending with an appropriate SDN-enabled response on physical switch flow tables. Responses can include traffic redirection, host quarantining, filtering, and more. SDN allows greater flexibility and command/control compared to legacy, manual administrator response or the iptables solution of traditional IDS. By pushing security event information to a global controller, immediate and intelligent changes can be made across the network. When an attack occurs, AHNSR increases responsiveness while decreasing information damage - a goal every incident response team should have. We compare different methods of pushing security event information from hosts and the resulting system performance at specified security level thresholds. A testable SDN-controlled network is constructed with multiple hosts, OpenFlow enabled switches, and a Floodlight controller, all linked to a custom, novel interface for the Open-Source SECurity (OSSEC) HIDS framework. OSSEC is implemented in a server-agent architecture, allowing scalability and OS independence. System effectiveness is evaluated against the following factors: alert density, file integrity check frequency, rootkit detection status, and log monitoring workload. At the expected operational load of 500 events per second (EPS), results reveal a mean system response time of, 5564 seconds from log generation to flow table update via Floodlight's Access Control List module. Load testing further assesses performance of response methods at EPS levels 10-10000.",Scopus,"Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security, ICCWS 2017",1449

It has been demonstrated multiple times that exploiting the System Management Mode (SMM), an operating mode implemented in the x86 architecture and executed with high privileges, is an extremely powerful method for implanting persistent malware on computer systems. However, previous BIOS/UEFI malware concepts described in the literature often focused on proof-of-concept implementations and did not have the goal of demonstrating the full range of threats stemming from SMM malware. In this paper, we present LONGKIT, a novel framework for BIOS/UEFI malware in the SMM. LONGKIT is universal in nature, meaning it is fully written in position-independent assembly and thus also runs on other BIOS/UEFI implementations with minimal modifications. The framework fully supports the 64-bit Intel architecture and is memory-layout aware, enabling targeted interaction with the operating system’s kernel. With LONGKIT we are able to demonstrate the full potential of malicious code in the SMM and provide researchers of novel SMM malware detection strategies with an easily adaptable rootkit to help evaluate their methods.

Meanwhile, encryption, which is an indispensable part of the security architecture, is computationally intensive and may imply a significant amount of energy consumption. Thus, it is of great importance to provide a sufficient level of security while properly utilizing the available resources. Traditional approaches mainly cope with maintaining a high level of confidentiality. However, energy implications are not taken into consideration. In this work this issue is addressed and the performance of the encryption schemes for all available security options is investigated. Specifically, the performance of five encryption algorithms is investigated, by adjusting several encryption parameters, such as key size, data size, mode of operation, padding scheme and so forth. 100 simulations of the encryption procedure were carried out and 576 performance data streams were collected, including the encryption time and CPU process time. A global performance metric was obtained that illuminates the trade-off between energy consumption and encryption strength. This research suggests a security framework which is based on the Reliability function, with the ability to adjust dynamically the level of security with respect to energy consumption. The proposed security approach is twofold, as the security mode can be adjusted either according to the severity of the requested service, or according to a specified energy threshold. In both cases, Reliability is adopted, so that a global quality factor is concluded that allows for optimal security mode selection. A saving of up to 10% in terms of energy has been shown for an example user specification, by means of the appropriate parameter selection. As expected, it was found that the adaptability of an encryption system can indeed be based on the energy consumption of the encryption algorithms. By adjusting the encryption parameters and therefore the level of security, unnecessary energy consumption can be avoided.",Scopus,"European Conference on Information Warfare and Security, ECCWS",1453

To address this problem, this paper proposes an innovative approach to develop a specification-based intrusion detection framework that leverages available information provided by components in a contemporary power system. A Bayesian network is used to graphically encode the causal relations among the available information to create patterns with temporal state transitions, which are used as rules in the proposed intrusion detection framework. This allows the proposed framework to detect cyber attacks and classify different substation scenarios. A case study is provided for the non-pilot directional over current relay protection scheme for a modified 2-bus 2-generator system taken from a section of the IEEE 9-bus 3-generator system. Nine power system scenarios were developed and implemented as part of the case study. Each scenario was implemented on a test bed and all scenarios were correctly classified by the IDS built using the proposed methodology.",Scopus,International Journal of Network Security,1456

They fail to provide the essential context of a threat and yields false positives-negatives which can trigger pointless re-configurations, service unavailability and end user discomfort.

These formalization requirements become apparent in the context of an ESA realistic application scenario that involves the possible collision of two space objects in Earth orbit that are characterized by different sensitivity levels. To aid the decision toward safe collision avoidance actions, the secure and efficient sharing of sensitive information data between the operators of the two objects must be ensured. We present a novel approach and formal framework based on the algebraic theory of graph transformation to achieve this goal. We use the visual modeling language Henshin to formally specify the enforcement of policy rule-sets and computational semantics on the scenario's sensitive data before it is released from higher to lower security levels.

In parallel, special privacy and sharing constraints deriving from the scenario's context dictate the need of balancing data security with data usability during the downgrading process.

The extension of operating licenses for power reactors has been a viable option for nuclear power plants operators to ensure the adequacy of future capacity of power generation, in terms of economic benefits, compared with the construction of new power reactors. Active equipment is considered as adequately monitored under the existing regulatory process where aging effects that might occur are more easily detectable and therefore corrected by the testing program, by the maintenance program or through the indicators highlighted in its performance. The NRC Maintenance Rule is a prerequisite for the license renewal for US plants, and it provides an aging management tool for active equipment. The purpose of this paper is to present a model that can be implemented in a personal computer, which allows the reliability analysis of nuclear power plant safety systems, starting from a state transition diagram, typically employed in Markovian reliability analyses. Considering the equipment qualified life extension, the classical Markovian model will not apply if at least one of the transition rates in the state transition diagram is time-dependent, due to equipment aging. To overcome this difficulty, the model is recast into a Markovian model by means of supplementary variables. The key feature here is the definition of maintenance procedures in the context of the maintenance program that are also adequate for the qualified life extension license. The algorithm developed for this purpose also estimates the necessary parameters for the reliability analysis, starting from crude failure information available from the plant and using goodness of fit statistical tests for the most commonly employed probability distributions, like the Weibull distribution.",Scopus,"11th International Probabilistic Safety Assessment and Management Conference and the Annual European Safety and Reliability Conference 2012, PSAM11 ESREL 2012",1468

We have verified our concept by implementing two novel distributed detection schemes against two different types of DDoS attacks. An embedded accelerator for shrew DDoS attacks detection has been designed using FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array). The synthesis and simulation verified its capability of coping with multi-gigabyte data rate in today's high-speed network environment. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently working to define acceptable UAS performance standards and procedures for routine access for their use in the National Airspace System (NAS). This study examined the effects of system reliability and time pressure on unmanned aircraft systems operator performance and mental workload. Twenty-four undergraduate and graduate students, male and female, from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University participated in this study on a voluntary basis. The primary tasks were image processing time and target acquisition accuracy; three secondary tasks were concerned with responding to events encountered in typical UAS operations. Mental workload and trust levels of Multi-Modal Immersive Intelligent Interface for Remote Operation (MIIIRO) system were also studied and analyzed. System reliability was found to produce a significant effect for image processing time, while time pressure produced a significant effect for target acquisition accuracy. A significant effect was found for the interaction between system reliability and time pressure for pop-up threats re-routing processing time.

The sparse and random placement of instructions in a wide instruction space of the virtual machine enables it to detect and limit illegal access attempts by exploiting security vulnerability.

It allows platforms to get a trustworthy proof of the loaded software and current configuration of certain remote platforms, thereby enabling them to make decisions about the remote platforms' trust status. Common concepts like Internet Protocol security or Transport Layer Security make these decisions based on shared secrets or certificates issued by third parties. Unlike remote attestation, these concepts do not take the current configuration or currently loaded software of the platforms into account. Consequently, combining remote attestation and existing secure channel concepts can solve the long lasting problem of secure channels that have to rely on insecure channel endpoints. Although this gap can now be closed by Trusted Computing, one important problem remains unsolved: A platform's configuration changes every time new software is loaded. Consequently, a reliable and in-time method to provide a proof for this configuration change - especially on multiprocess machines - is required to signal the platforms involved in the communication that a configuration change of the respectively other platform has taken place.

It is necessary to check the security level of your system and keep it updated. This can be best achieved by using a metric system. At present, there is no standard metric to measure the integrity and security of a computer system. Defining a standard metric that suits all the systems is difficult, considering the fact that every system is built according to the functions it is used for. The Computer systems are used for millions of different functions. In this work we develop an adaptive metric system for measuring security and integrity level of a computer system. To define the metric system we have used a matrix called Security Matrix. We call this matrix adaptive because users can introduce or delete columns in the matrix according to their requirements. The idea behind this is to allow the user to have a metric system that suits his or her system best. Each dimension in the matrix represents one influential factor of the system security and integrity. The factors can vary from the software used in the system to the mediums of attack on the system.

The sequential composition of F(.) and G(.) is the function G(F(.)), the parallel composition is F(.) * G(.) where * is some group operation. It has been shown that composition indeed gives adaptive security in the information theoretic setting, but unfortunately the proof does not translate into the more interesting computational case. In this work we show that in the computational setting composition does not imply adaptive security: If there is a prime order cyclic group where the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption holds, then there are functions F and G which are indistinguishable by non-adaptive polynomially time-bounded adversaries, but whose parallel composition can be completely broken (i.e. we recover the key) with only three adaptive queries. We give a similar result for sequential composition.

A major conclusion of the survey is that formal methods, while still immature in some respects, can be used successfully to assist in developing safety-critical systems. © 2005 WIT Press.",Scopus,WIT Transactions on the Built Environment,1509

In order to keep the cost down, a purchaser tends to send out the request for quotation for a group of potential suppliers. The purchaser will choose a supplier with the best combination of price and quality. Sometimes a potential supplier will try to collect the information about other suppliers so he/she can provide the best bid to the purchaser. Since most transactions are done through a computer network system such as Extranet or Internet, the confidentiality becomes very important between suppliers and the purchaser. The Bell-LaPadula model is one of security models for information confidentiality and has been adopted by military for a long time. Chen et. al. has proposed the application of Bell-LaPadula model in the design of supply chain network. In the Bell-Lapadula model a subject can be in one of different security clearance and an object can be in one of various security classifications.

However, replacement of a component at runtime without stopping the application remains a difficult problem, since the state contained in the active version of the component must somehow be transferred to its successor. Existing techniques that implement live updates all require the programmer to manually implement the state transition functionality. We have developed a methodology to deal with runtime adaptation of Java-based components. Our approach is innovative since it provides a number of steps that assist the programmer with the issue of state transfer. In this paper, we first introduce our global methodology, and then continue with a detailed study of the algorithm that controls state transfer between components at runtime. Two novel aspects of our algorithm are its extensibility and its ability to keep portions of the old component in place by preventing localized changes from propagating throughout the entire component.",Scopus,"Proceedings of the 2005 International Conference on Programming Languages and Compilers, PLC'05",1511

The low initial costs for hardware and the use of mobile equipment (Notebook, PDA) increase the acceptance. The access to the wireless network - not only from inside a building - increases the security risk. Thus, the wireless network must be protected. With the implemented mechanisms (e.g. WEP) a secure connection is not guaranteed. The established mechanisms are insecure. This may be solved by the IEEE 802.11i standard. All components (wireless cards, access points) must support this standard for adaptive security. For a successful integration of a network-wide security concept, all systems must be considered. They must be as secure as possible for such a realization. A VPN connection among wireless systems and the local network is one solution. A concept for general security - analogous to intrusion detection systems (IDS) - can be implemented under this condition.

The goal of this project is to be able to run the systems thanks to simulation software, which can be replaced by the real parts as soon as they are built. This generic software can be used in the simulation and evaluation mode and also in the final operational mode. Our approach can be summarized by the following three key points: A distributed architecture of smart sensors and actuators, which are binded by a dedicated data network (CAN fieldbus). An embedded version of Linux, which acts as an an ethernet gateway is developed and allows the supervision of a remote control points. The connections of new elements are simplified thanks to a classification of sensors and actuators. When new machine or systems are developed with requirements such as flexibility and real time constraints we chose an open architecture divided in two stages to ensure optimal data transmission security. The low-level activity is ensured by a priority-based fieldbus to connect hardware devices through low cost micro-controllers. The second level interface collects data flow and transfers control from the ethernet supervisor. This interface runs on an embedded PC under Linux operating system (OS). With such an open OS, a very compact and evaluative code has been produced. A first demonstration model was developed in collaboration with the astrophysical Labs and Observatory of Grenoble. This model has allowed a validation of the proposed architecture for an experimental astrophysical instrument.

This prevents IP packets from reaching the node if it moves to a new location and tries to connect to its home network from within a different network. Changing the IP address of a node when it moves is not possible while keeping existing transport level connections open. This change requires the termination of all current network activity and the user making a number of configuration changes followed by rebooting of the Node.

Though the generation of the port profiles requires the minimum calculation and memory, they exhibit high stability and robustness.

The paper gives high accuracy security classification without the need for a very big size training set. The problem has been solved in two stages. In the first stage an approximate classifier is to be found corresponding to a reasonable number of operating states. The neural network used in this stage has no hidden layers, as only approximate classifier is needed, which reduces the training procedure effort. In the second stage a training set is then to be generated in the space around this approximate classifier using an appropriate step by step mathematical technique. A multilayer neural network is then to be trained by this new training set to get a high accuracy classifier. A corrective action is also suggested. When insecure case is detected in the real life operation, corrective action must take place to take the system from the insecure to the secure state. This can be done by using the approximate classifier expression and the power balance equation at first to move the insecure operating point to the secure region. The new operating point is then to be checked using the high accuracy classifier, if found insecure it can be easily moved to a new point and then rechecked until the point attains the security state.

The current approach to expressing safety policy in such models is to use constraints. When the constraints are verified, then the configuration is verified to be safe. However, the addition of constraints to an access control configuration significantly increases its complexity, so it quickly becomes difficult to understand the access control policy expressed in the configuration such that future changes can be made correctly. We propose an approach whereby the complexity of each access control configuration is estimated, so the administrators can see the effect of a configuration change on the future ability to maintain the configuration. We identify metrics for making complexity estimates and evaluate these metrics on some constraint examples.

The four methods discussed include • reloading a new security database for the Security Server, • expanding the state and security database of the Security Server to include more than one mode of operation, • implementing another Security Server and handing off control for security computations, and • implementing multiple, concurrent Security Servers each controlling a subset of processes.

Certain requirements to secure the product continuously add further complexity to the aforementioned dimensions. Adversaries adapt - so the protection shall as well. However, adapting, particularly, technical solutions to products, implies the need for agnostic approaches. In this article, we propose a security-risk mitigation concept which aims to fit into the evolving automotive originating process applied to a particular class of electronic control units. Technically, the proposed approach shuffles the system memory-map of an asynchronous multiprocessing system. On the intermediate layer between the hardware and software, the assignment of memory and resources is obfuscated to a potential adversary who managed to breach one of the higher level memory protection mechanisms.

One apparent solution to this problem is the use of security gateways that apply the relevant security protocols on behalf of the protected nodes, under the assumption that the ``last hop'' between the security gateway and the end node is safe without cryptography. Such a gateway can be set to enforce specific security policies for different types of traffic. While this solution is appealing in static scenarios (such as building so-called ``intranets''), the use of Layer-3 (network) routers as security gateways presents some transparency and configuration problems with regards to peer authentication in the automated key management protocol. This paper describes the architecture and implementation of a Layer-2 (link layer) bridge with extensions for offering Layer-3 security services. We extend the OpenBSD ethernet bridge to perform simple IP packet filtering and IPsec processing for incoming and outgoing packets on behalf of a protected node, completely transparently to both the protected and the remote communication endpoint. The same mechanism may be used to construct ``virtual local area networks,'' by establishing IPsec tunnels between OpenBSD bridges connected geographically separated LANs. As our system operates in the link layer, there is no need for software or configuration changes in the protected nodes.",Web of Science,USENIX ASSOCIATION PROCEEDINGS OF THE FREENIX TRACK,1531

In this paper, we applied self-healing mechanism, the core technology of autonomic computing to analyze the dependability of the ITS. In other words, we described the state transition of the ITS composed of a primary server and a backup server utilizing two factors of self-healing mechanism (fault model and system response) and analyzed it using M/G/1 queuing technique. We also evaluated the availability of the ITS through simulation experiments.",Web of Science,"TRUST, PRIVACY, AND SECURITY IN DIGITAL BUSINESS",1532
4217,y,MAST - A mobile agent-based security tool,,"Carvalho M,Cowin T,Suri N",,,2003.0,Conference Paper,"One of the chief computer security problems is not the long list of viruses and other potential vulnerabilities, but the vast number of systems that continue to be easy prey, as their system administrators or owners simply aren't able to keep up with all of the available patches, updates, or needed configuration changes in order to protect them from those known vulnerabilities. Even up-to-date systems could become vulnerable to attacks, due to inappropriate configuration or combined used of applications and services. Our mobile agent-based security tool (MAST) is designed to bridge this gap, and provide automated methods to make sure that all of the systems in a specific domain or network are secured and up-to-date with all patches and updates. The tool is also designed to check systems for misconfigurations that make them vulnerable. Additionally, this user interface is presented in a domain knowledge model known as a Concept Map that provides a continuous teaming experience for the system administrator.",Web of Science,"7TH WORLD MULTICONFERENCE ON SYSTEMICS, CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS, VOL XI, PROCEEDINGS: COMMUNICATION, NETWORK AND CONTROL SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS: II",1533
4222,y,Stabilizing Control for Cyber-Physical Systems against Energy-Constrained Deception Attacks,,"He J,Liang Y,Xu L,Yan S",,,2019.0,Conference Paper,"Stabilizing control of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is an important yet challenging problem since system modelling may face the coexistence of multiple uncertainties including unknown disturbances, unknown bounded delays, stochastic malicious attack and stochastic mode switching in complex environment, which cause system performance to deteriorate or even be unstable. However, the above uncertainties are rarely considered simultaneously in existing study. To this end, a novel system model is proposed to reflect not only the nonlinear characteristics, external disturbances and time-varying delays, but also the randomly occurring deception attacks, which is energy-constrained and lead to the system mode switching. We aim at designing a controller such that the system achieve the prescribed Ho., disturbance rejection level. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and using the stochastic analysis techniques, the addressed controller design problem is transformed to an convex optimization problem, which can be solved by a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. An example is given to show the effectiveness of the designed controller.",Web of Science,"ICCAIS 2019: THE 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, AUTOMATION AND INFORMATION SCIENCES",1534
4287,y,Secure Communication of Intelligent Electronic Devices in Digital Substations,,"Ishchenko D,Nuqui R",,,2018.0,Conference Paper,"This paper presents a communication ``bump-in-the-wire'' Security Filter device connected between the digital relays and the IEC 61850 communication buses to secure digital substation communications. Security Filter authenticates and verifies the designated Ethernet packets transmitted between protection and control devices by appending a message authentication code based on symmetric cryptography, which is compliant with the new mechanisms described in IEC 61850 and suitable for embedded system implementation. A prototype development and testing on a low cost commodity embedded system has proved that Security Filter can fully protect digital substation communication against replay attacks with time delays within the range of the most stringent IEC 61580 performance class requirements. The paper also presents multi-mode Security Filter operation design, which provides a practical interoperable way to upgrade and secure legacy substations with minimal modification or interruption to the existing systems.",Web of Science,2018 IEEE/PES TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION CONFERENCE AND EXPOSITION (T&D),1535
4303,y,TCP-Fuzz: Detecting Memory and Semantic Bugs in TCP Stacks with Fuzzing,,"Zou YH,Bai JJ,Zhou J,Tan J,Qin C,Hu SM",,,2021.0,Conference Paper,"TCP stacks provide reliable data transmission in network, and thus they should be correctly implemented and well tested to ensure reliability and security. However, testing TCP stacks is difficult. First, a TCP stack accepts packets and system calls that have dependencies between each other, and thus generating effective test cases is challenging. Second, a TCP stack has various complex state transitions, but existing testing approaches target covering states instead of covering state transitions, and thus their testing coverage is limited. Finally, our study of TCP stack commits shows that 87% of bug-fixing commits are related to semantic bugs (such as RFC violations), but existing bug sanitizers can detect only memory bugs not semantic bugs. In this paper, we design a novel fuzzing framework named TCP-Fuzz, to effectively test TCP stacks and detect bugs. TCP-Fuzz consists of three key techniques: (1) a dependency-based strategy that considers dependencies between packets and system calls, to generate effective test cases; (2) a transition-guided fuzzing approach that uses a new coverage metric named branch transition as program feedback, to improve the coverage of state transitions; (3) a differential checker that compares the outputs of multiple TCP stacks for the same inputs, to detect semantic bugs. We have evaluated TCP-Fuzz on five widely-used TCP stacks (TLDK, F-Stack, mTCP, FreeBSD TCP and Linux TCP), and find 56 real bugs (including 8 memory bugs and 48 semantic bugs). 40 of these bugs have been confirmed by related developers.",Web of Science,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2021 USENIX ANNUAL TECHNICAL CONFERENCE,1536
4353,y,Designing reliable server pools for battlefield ad-hoc networks,,"Fecko MA,Samtani S,Uyar MU,Conrad PT",,,2002.0,Conference Paper,"We discuss research issues pertinent to providing reliable server pooling in military mobile ad-hoc networks. To persistently maintain connections for military applications even as links and nodes migrate or become disabled, server pooling is used to increase system availability by allowing a pool of redundant information sources to be viewed as a single transport endpoint. We aim to design reliable server pooling for networks that are highly mobile, have limited processing power, and are capable of rapid self-configuration and autoaddressing of nodes and interfaces. Novel aspects of our research are also the investigation of server pooling with respect to both end-user applications and infrastructure components, extensible, intelligent server selection policies to select pool elements more proactively, as well as an application's and the security middleware's state transfer. We define the following key architectural requirements for reliable server pooling in mobile ad-hoc networks: (1) fast switchover, (2) dynamic (re-)configuration, (3) survivability, (4) application transparency, and (5) control signal efficiency. The paper describes in detail how the above requirements are being addressed in our research, and presents the initial approaches to solutions.",Web of Science,"6TH WORLD MULTICONFERENCE ON SYSTEMICS, CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS, VOL X, PROCEEDINGS: MOBILE/WIRELESS COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS II",1537
