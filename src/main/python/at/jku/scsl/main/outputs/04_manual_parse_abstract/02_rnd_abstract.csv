29,Component Model of Grid Cyber Physical Systems Based on Finite Automata,"the power system is gradually developing into a grid cyber physical system with deep integration of information systems and physical systems on the basis of informatization and automation. Studying the grid cyber physical system will provide a solid theoretical foundation for the construction of smart grids and ubiquitous power Internet of Things. In this paper, the finite-state automaton model of power components is studied from the micro level. The working state characteristics, state transition rules and state transition functions of power components are analyzed. The finite-state automaton model of power components is demonstrated by taking Feeder Terminal Unit components as an example."
39,Study of optimal replacement strategy of degradation system components for system availability,"In support process of equipment systems, spare inventory strategy, turnaround time, and product maintenance strategies have a great impact on system support time, and support time is one of the most important factors for the readiness and the task persistence of systems. Therefore, the use of reasonable spare inventory strategy, as well as maintenance and support decisions to systems is essential to improve system availability, security and system cost reducing. Maintenance strategy can be formulated based on the situation in which the products are monitored. For a single-component system, current research around its multi-state transferring have been quite mature, in which the conversion rate defined in a different state in Markov process can be clearly showed by conversion relationship between different state. However, the state transition process involved mostly considers the processes of repairing only, and rarely considers the impact to system availability by the transition of failure rate caused by changes in components, spare replacement strategies and spare supply. To solve this problem, this paper considered a single-component system with two derating states, and discussed its steady-state availability through variable spare replacement probability and different spare fill rate levels. With model of the system with two derating states established, generalized Markov method was used to solve the relationships between replacement timing and system availability with the level of spare fill rate considered. Finally, through the analysis of results, the preliminary conclusions were obtained. The results could clearly reveal the impacts of spare replacement strategy and spare fill rate in single-component system."
40,Principled design of the modern Web architecture,"The World Wide Web has succeeded in the large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The modern Web architecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. We introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of the Web architecture to guide our redesign and definition of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications they are intended to support."
51,Detecting Anomalous Behavior in VoIP Systems: A Discrete Event System Modeling,"Session initiation protocol (SIP) is an application layer protocol used for signaling purposes to manage voice over IP connections. SIP being a text-based protocol is vulnerable to a range of denial of service (DoS) attacks. These DoS attacks can render the SIP servers/SIP proxy servers unusable by depleting memory and CPU time. In this paper, we consider two types of DoS attacks, namely, flooding attacks and coordinated attacks for detection. Flooding attacks affect both stateless and stateful SIP servers while coordinated attacks affect stateful SIP servers. We model the SIP operation as discrete event system (DES) and design a new state transition machine, which we name as probabilistic counting deterministic timed automata (PCDTA) to describe the behavior of SIP operations. We also identify different types of anomalies that can occur in a DES model, which appear in the form of illegal transitions, violating timing constraints, and appear in number which is otherwise not seen. Subsequently, we map various DoS attacks in SIP to a type of anomaly in DES. PCDTA can learn probabilities of various transitions and timings delay from a set of nonmalicious training sequences. A trained PCDTA can detect anomalies, and hence various DoS attacks in SIP. We perform a thorough experiment with computer simulated SIP traffic and report the detection performance of PCDTA on various attacks generated through custom scripts."
54,Dependability Analysis of Information Systems with Hierarchical Reconfiguration of Services,"The paper presents an approach to dependability analysis of a class of networked information systems based on distributed services. The system consists of groups of servers that react autonomously to detected events, component failures and security incidents. These local reactions affect the availability of the services, provided by the system, then restored by reconfiguration. The dependability analysis is based on the construction of a reconfiguration graph, which is transformed to a state-transition dependability model."
58,Policy Monitoring and a Finite State Automata Model,"Policy monitoring is one of the most indispensable parts in the security policy management, which can improve the reliability of the system and offer the references to the other audit after some security incidentspsila occurrences. In this paper, the policy states are divided into several types. Also the policy states transition model based on the Mealy automata is promoted, which provides the objects and method for the policy monitoring. Finally, the programs implementation of the automata and the test results demonstrate the timely response as soon as events happen."
82,Survivability evaluation index systems and evaluation models for Wireless Sensor Networks,"Survivability evaluation index systems and evaluation models are important basis for evaluating network survivability. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a common system evaluation method, but it cannot reflect the mutual influence among evaluation indexes. In order to overcome the defects of AHP, the survivability evaluation index set of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) in emergency communications is selected comprehensively, and establishes a survivability index system of WSN based on the Analytic Network Process (ANP). Then, a survivability evaluation model for clustering WSN based on semi-Markov Process (SMP) is put forward in this paper, and a SMP-based survival state transition diagram of cluster head is given. Survivability evaluation index systems and evaluation models are not only helpful to accessing the survivability of WSN in emergency communications objectively and effectively, but also to providing reference basis for the actual deployment and application of WSN."
101,Dynamic security constrained var planning for competitive environments,"This paper presents a formulation for VAR planning method for guaranteeing secure power system operation in competitive environments. The formulation is useful for the evaluation of reactive power value, for effective investment of slow and fast VAR devices, for the examination of pricing and procurement of VARs through market. Since load shedding is the last resort for keeping security, the annual expectation of the load shedding cost is used as a security index to evaluate the overall benefits of VAR resources which respond in dynamic state transitions in contingencies. The proposed formulation takes into account the multiple benefits of reactive power in a single problem, which may be useful to evaluate the real value of the VARs. It is demonstrated that the maximum cost saving is achieved by a balanced installation of SC and SVC with keeping a specified security level. A VAR procurement method through market is also investigated using the formulation."
157,CoToRu: Automatic Generation of Network Intrusion Detection Rules from Code,"Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are the brains of Industrial Control Systems (ICSes), and thus, are often targeted by attackers. While many intrusion detection systems (IDSes) have been adapted to monitor ICS, they cannot detect malicious network packets from a compromised PLC that con-form to the network protocol. A domain expert needs to manually construct IDS rules to model a PLC’s behavior. That approach is time-consuming and error-prone. Alternatively, machine learning can infer a PLC’s behavior model from network traces, but that model may be inaccurate due to a lack of high-quality training data. This paper presents CoToRu - a toolchain that takes in the PLC’s code to automatically generate a comprehensive set of IDS rules. CoToRu comprises (1) an analyzer that parses PLC code to build a state transition table for modeling the PLC’s behavior, and (2) a generator that instantiates IDS rules for detecting deviations in PLC behavior. The generated rules can be imported into Zeek IDS to detect various attacks. We apply CoToRu to a power grid testbed and show that our generated rules provide superior performance compared to existing IDSes, including those based on statistical analysis, invariant-checking, and machine learning. Our prototype with CoToRu’s generated rules provide sub-millisecond detection latency, even for complex PLC logic."
160,Preserving Contextual Privacy for Smart Home IoT Devices With Dynamic Traffic Shaping,"Internet of Things (IoT) enables physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to interoperate and exchange data with other systems over the Internet. Privacy is a huge concern for IoT devices as personal information is constantly being shared through them. Though the best industrial standards like end-to-end encryption are being followed to ensure content-based privacy, contextual privacy concerns still exist. This study focuses on user activity inference attacks, where a passive network observer can infer the private in-home activity of a user by analyzing encrypted IoT traffic metadata. Most of the previous solutions addressing these attacks have either reduced the usability of the devices, increased data overhead, or failed against packet-level signature-based attack scenarios. This study introduces a new defense mechanism that combines dummy packet generation with dynamic link padding. This process makes it difficult for the adversary to avail contextual information about the state of the device (ON or OFF), along with the temporal information (time of state change) from encrypted IoT traffic metadata. We reverse the packet-level signature-based attacks to get device-specific signatures, which helps us generate dummy traffic for the duration of device-specific signatures. Consequently, this results in increased false positives for device state identifications and low traffic overhead. We simulate a state-of-the-art attack scenario to test and vindicate our solution over existing data sets."
171,Reactive and Adaptive Security Monitoring in Cloud Computing,"Cloud computing enabled service-level agreements (SLAs) to gain widespread use among information systems stakeholders. It is now normal for performance and availability of such systems to be carefully measured and evaluated. Contracts that include financial penalties in case of breach are now common. However security is lagging behind this trend; it is as important to stakeholders as performance and availability, but is generally not included in the scope of service-level agreements between stakeholders, and handled instead on a best-effort basis, without any transparency nor SLA with their clients. One reason for this is the difficulty of objectively measuring security. Indeed, the actual security level of a system is dependent on a wide range of factors, some intrinsic to the system - such as a design or implementation mistake resulting in a vulnerability - and some extrinsic to it. For instance, an external event such as the publication of a vulnerability in an open-source software dependency or a change of political context in a country can widely impact the risks faced by an information system even if no actual change were made to the system. These factors are even more numerous in multi-tenant cloud infrastructures because of the sheer number of actors involved - and their sometimes conflicting incentives - and opportunities for both attack and defense at scale. Security monitoring aims to detect and react to attacks in real time; Reactive security monitoring intends to take external events into account while doing so. Improving the accuracy of a system's overall security assessment can help transitioning security to a SLA paradigm and enable better transparency for all stakeholders."
186,MaPE-K-Based Approach for Security @ Runtime,"Dynamic systems cause challenges for security because it is impossible to anticipate all the possible changes at design-time. Adaptive security is an applicable solution for this challenge. It is able to automatically select security mechanisms and their parameters at runtime in order to preserve the required security level in a changing environment. In this paper we describe an approach detailing key steps and activities to create an adaptive security solution. The architecture conforms to the MAPE-K reference model, which is a widely applied reference model in autonomic computing. Steps include: Establishing a control point to force control of the security decision process from the existing system. Identifying an environment parameter with which the security will trade off. Studying the interrelationship between security and the environment parameter in the existing system context by identifying measurable factors which influence their relationship. Formulation of a trade-off goal which is optimised based on multiple objectives, one of which is a security objective. Consequently, the proposed approach is capable of deploying mechanisms adaptive security to satisfy different security needs at different conditions."
197,An Adaptive Security Model for Multi-agent Systems and Application to a Clinical Trials Environment,"We present in this paper an adaptive security model for Multi-agent systems. A security meta-model has been developed in which the traditional role concept has been extended. The new concept incorporates the need of both security management as used by role-based access control (RBAC) and agent functional behaviour in agent-oriented Software Engineering (AOSE). Our approach avoids weaknesses of traditional RBAC approaches and provides a practically usable security model for multi-agent systems (MAS). A unified role interaction model framework has been put forward that incorporates not only functional requirements but also security constraints in MAS. A security policy rule scheme has been used to express security requirements in relation to affective roles. The major contribution of the work is that little redevelopment effort will be required when security is to be engineered into the overall MAS architecture, hence minimising the impact of the security requirements changes to the MAS architecture. We illustrate the approach through its potential application in a clinical trial setting involving a prototype medical decision support system, HealthAgents."
220,Adaptive dependable and secure protection systems for electric power systems,"This paper proposes a new philosophy on protection systems in bulk electric power systems. Traditional protection systems are non-adaptive and have been usually applied with bias towards dependability, one of the two considerations on designing electric grid protection systems (the other one is security). The art and science of protection and control of tomorrow drives the power system professionals to design and implement schemes that are adaptive and aim towards security. It is important to minimize system exposures when the power system is in a stressed state or in early stages of a sequence of events to halt or mitigate disturbance propagation. One of the leading contributions to the future of grid protection would be to avoid incorrect tripping of unaffected equipment therefore maintaining the power system integrity. In addition, with the ever-increasing load demand and the advent of the deregulated power market recently, power systems are pushed more often to operate close to design limits and with more uncertainty of the system operating mode. The proposed protection systems offer adaptive concepts by adjusting the need for more dependability or security as applicable, through the application of fuzzy logic and based on a set of real-time factors, such as system state index, nodal price, and equipment outage impact index. Results from our work can be used as a roadmap for further enhancement leading to the introduction of algorithms in commercial products."
237,System level security modeling using attack trees,"Vulnerabilities in intrusion tolerant systems have dependence on various dynamic aspects such as redundant mechanisms, fault and error recovery mechanisms, and different operation modes. The conventional nodes of attack trees cannot adequately capture the attacks towards those systems, thus constructing security models for the systems is very difficult. This paper introduces new nodes to model the security of those systems. The nodes include: PAND node, k/n node, SEQ node, CSUB node, and Housing node. We provide the syntax and graphical representation for each node. The nodes allow us to model attacks that require exploitation of vulnerabilities which have dependence on ordering events, sequence-dependant events, conditional failures and mechanisms which involve configuration changes with time. We use the nodes to construct attack trees for different security related systems."
278,New Network Management System with Communication Control of the Client,"Where customers with different membership and position, use computers as in the university network systems, it often takes much time and efforts for them to cope with the change of the system management. This is because the requirements for the respective computer usage are different in the network and security policies. In this paper, a new destination addressing control system (DACS) scheme for the university network services is proposed. The DACS scheme performs the network services efficiently through the communication management of a client. As the characteristic of DACS scheme, only the setup modification is required by a system administrator, when the configuration change is needed in the network server. Then, the setup modification is unnecessary by a customer, which shows a merit for both a system administrator and a customer. This paper describes the instruction and the prototype for DACS protocol as the implementation of DACS scheme. Then, the simplicity of the system management in DACS scheme, is examined from the customer and the system administrator viewpoints"
303,A Chinese Multi-modal Relation Extraction Model for Internet Security of Finance,"As the base of the whole economy and society, internet security of finance directly affects the overall development of the country. With the development of the Internet, it is essential to effectively extract the relation between financial entities from internet financial intelligence and build a financial security knowledge graph, which lays the foundation for monitoring of internet security of finance. For relation extraction of Chinese internet financial intelligence, the existing models are all based on single-modal text semantics ignoring the role of Chinese pictographic semantics, while the shape and structure of Chinese characters contains useful semantics. In addition, the pictographic semantic fusion method of Chinese text also needs to be improved for better performance. To solve these shortcomings, we propose a Chinese Multimodal Relation Extraction model (CMRE), which improves the relation extraction ability on the Chinese internet financial intelligence. In CMRE, we extract pictographic semantics based on Chinese character shape and structure. Furthermore, we design a novel multi-modal semantic fusion module based on improved Transformer to effectively fuse the text and pictographic semantics. Additionally, we design experiments on the Chinese literature dataset(Sanwen) to test the relation extraction capability of CMRE. Finally, we employ CMRE to extract relations between financial entities on the internet financial intelligence dataset(FinRE) to compare with other baseline models."
312,Research on the innovation of liaoning public safety and security emergency management system from the perspective of smart city,"This paper studies innovating Liaoning's Public Safety and Security emergency management system, and improving Liaoning' s emergency management capabilities comprehensively in five major aspects, namely the upgrading of philosophy, the management coordination, the application of technology, the linkage on links, and the guarantee of resources, with the aid of a new generation of information technology tools such as the Internet of Things and cloud computing, and with the help of the operational mode of full perception, deep integration and intelligent collaboration."
315,End-to-end security in the presence of intelligent data adapting proxies: the case of authenticating transcoded streaming media,"We consider the problem of maintaining end-to-end security in the presence of intelligent proxies that may adaptively modify data being transmitted across a network. The video coding community considers this problem in the context of transcoding media streams, but their approaches either fail to address authentication or fail to provide meaningful security guarantees. We present two provably-secure schemes, LISSA and TRESSA, that allow an intelligent network intermediary to intercept a stream signed by a content provider, and adapt it dynamically, while preserving the ultimate receiver's ability to securely verify the content provider's signature (and, hence, authenticity and integrity of the data received). Our schemes allow the intermediary to selectively remove portions of the stream and, thus, permit common media transcoding techniques such as scalable compression and multiple file switching. Moreover, a content provider only has to encode and sign its entire data stream once, as opposed to nondynamically encoding and signing different versions for each anticipated combination of device, network configuration, and channel condition. Our implementation results demonstrate efficiency."
333,Adaptive Learning-Based Secure and Energy-Aware Resource Management for Multi-Mode Low-Carbon PIoT,"Multi-mode power internet of things (PIoT) provides spatio-temporal coverage for low-carbon operation in smart park through combining various communication media. Heterogeneous resources are dynamically and intelligently managed to improve resource utilization and achieve anti-eavesdropping. However, resource management in multi-mode power IoT confronts challenges such as the mutual contradiction in joint communication and security quality of service (QoS) guarantee and the inadaptability to low-carbon services. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive learNing-based secure and enerGy-awarE resource management aLgorithm (ANGEL) to optimize multi-mode channel selection and power splitting for artificial noise (AN)-based anti-eavesdropping. Based on deep actor-critic (DAC) and “win or learn fast (WoLF)” mechanism, ANGEL can realize multi-attribute QoS guarantee, adaptive resource management, and security enhancement. Simulation results demonstrate its superior performance in energy consumption, secrecy capacity, and adaptability to differentiated low-carbon services."
339,Optimal Mission Abort Planning for Partially Observable System,"Mission abort is proved to be an effective approach to improve the survivability of systems. The existing researches on mission abort generally believe that the degradation state of the system can be completely observed. The prevailing research on mission abort typically assumes fully observability of the system’s state, but in fact, many systems cannot detect the health state completely during the execution of a mission. This paper study the control policy that timely aborts the mission system whose state information cannot be completely monitoring. A partially observable Markov decision process is used to solve the problem by minimizing the cost probably incurred by the failure of mission and system. Some properties of the model are presented and proved."
343,Fast Economic Dispatch by Identifying Active Security Constraints Based on Sparse Polynomial Chaos Expansion,"In order to promote the optimal allocation of resources across the country, an inter-provincial and intra-provincial bi-level electricity market operational mode is gradually formed in China. In the electricity market, security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED) is an important procedure to realize market clearing. However, SCED problem with N-1 scenarios has a great number of security constraints, which severely affect the computation efficiency. To deal with the above problem, an active security constrain identification method is proposed by utilizing sparse polynomial chaos expansion (SPCE) in this paper. First, a bi-level electricity market economic dispatch model is established including N-1 security constraints. Then, a SPCE-based surrogate model for SCED is established based on historical data. By using the surrogate model, the active N-1 security constraints are identified in advance, which would significantly reduce the number of iterations for solving the SCED problem. Finally, an interconnected test system with multiple sending end power grids and receiving end power grids is constructed using IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems. Also, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation."
344,Extreme Learning Machine Based Transient Stability Assessment: An Energy Function Approach,One of the most challenging task at Energy Control Centre is the prediction of transient stability. Deregulation and ever increasing integration of renewables has made it complex and more demanding in terms of frequent evaluations. Transient Stability Assessment is computationally intensive task and longer computation cycle brings in obsolete results as system operating state evolves continuously. Extreme learning machine (ELM) offers prediction results comparable to other state-of-art learning methods and has much quicker learning curve. WSCC 3-machine 9-bus system and IEEE 39-bus New England test power system are considered to demonstrate the superiority of ELM as a predictive model. ELM is trained using data points generated through transient energy function (TEF) approach. Transient energy terms along with real and reactive power and fault location are used as input attributes for ELM to quickly and accurately determine transient stability margin (TEM).
362,Enhancing wireless security through reconfigurable antennas,Applying channel information for user authentication is gaining attention in the area of wireless network security. Numerous studies have demonstrated reconfigurable antennas with multiple operating modes that have the ability to choose the best channel in a given environment. We investigate the performance gains that can be achieved by using multiple uncorrelated channel realizations for user authentication at the physical layer by employing a reconfigurable antenna. Ray tracing simulations using a reconfigurable circular patch antenna were carried out and the intruder detection rate and false alarm rates were studied as a function of the number of available antenna modes and the SNR at the receiver.
364,SeReNe: On Establishing Secure and Resilient Networking Services for an SDN-based Multi-tenant Datacenter Environment,"In the current enterprise data enter networking environment, a major hurdle in the development of network security is the lack of an orchestrated and resilient defensive mechanism that uses well-established quantifiable metrics, models, and evaluation methods. In this position paper, we describe an emerging Secure and Resilient Networking (SeReNe) service model to establish a programmable and dynamic defensive mechanism that can adjust the system's networking resources such as topology, bandwidth allocation, and traffic/flow forwarding policies, according to the network security situations. We posit that this requires addressing two interdependent technical areas: (a) a Moving Target Defense (MTD) framework both at networking and software levels, and (b) an Adaptive Security-enabled Traffic Engineering (ASeTE) approach to select optimal countermeasures by considering the effectiveness of countermeasures and network bandwidth allocations while minimizing the intrusiveness to the applications and the cost of deploying the countermeasures. We believe that our position can greatly benefit the virtual networking system established in data Centerior enterprise virtual networking systems that have adopted latest Open Flow technologies."
382,MojSim: Computer Application for the Assessment of Anti-Jamming Capabilities of Wireless Systems,"In this paper, a computer application is proposed for evaluating communication security performance under jamming conditions in order to choose appropriate setups for the desired waveform. In addition, the effect of a follower jammer on frequency hopping link is modeled and simulated. The computer application determines safe and dangerous routes between two radios: transmitter and receiver in presence of a follower jammer. The application calculates link budget equations and colors the route depends on predefined specifications which are specified by the user. Initially user chooses waveform type and locates three main nodes' coordinates: transmitter, receiver, and jammer on an interactive map with their specifications such as operating mode, transmitted power, and hopping range. Also, locates sub points between transmitter and receiver which represent radio movements. These points form the route between transmitter and receiver radios."
391,Intel case study: Software on demand,"This paper presents the application of the software as a service (SaaS) approach of software streaming. Streaming refers to downloading software to client hardware platforms for temporary local execution. OS and application software is managed from a centralized server and provided only on-demand. Users obtain a clean, consistent, current build each time they log in, removing the nuisance of security patching and rebooting for environmental changes. Local execution and caching preserves user experience comparable to traditionally installed applications. To explore feasibility, Intel conducted a proof-of-concept (POC) to evaluate streaming in its call center and manufacturing environments on multi-user systems. The four-part study included performance, usability, IT operations and total cost of ownership (TCO). The proof-of-concept was successful in identifying streaming as a feasible technology with good performance and positive TCO in the tested scenarios. The biggest benefits were related to locking down the client and thus eliminating service calls related to configuration changes, software installation and viruses. The major challenges encountered were around the high learning curve and the software maturity related to packing applications for streaming. Based on the strong positive outcome of the POC, Intel has added streaming to its IT roadmaps."
396,Decision support system for substation operation,"The authors describe a prototype for a hybrid expert system developed to provide advice to station operators in real time. The domain of this expert system is transmission planning as applied to real-time operation. It consists of symbolic and procedural modules that address a variety of electrical concerns at generating stations, including breaker thermal duties, breaker fault duties, and voltage-critical load buses. Once the system is invoked, the prevailing operating state is evaluated for static security-limit violations. If any violations are encouraged, the system searches its knowledge base for plausible plans to alleviate the problem.<>"
412,Towards a Novel Framework for Reinforcing Cybersecurity using Digital Twins in IoT-based Healthcare Applications,"In recent years, the cybersecurity attacks on the internet of things (IoT)-based healthcare systems became the major concern for researchers and health organizations. With time, the sophistication of these attacks is increasing. Therefore, healthcare service providers must implement efficient security mechanisms carefully while taking the advantages of connected devices without compromising the patient safety and disturbing the real-time health services. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a real-time counterpart of a physical world. DT offers significant advantages to cybersecurity experts, empowering them to predict risks without entering the physical world, and to simulate and test cyber-attacks that would otherwise be infeasible to do in real-time in the physical environment. DT in healthcare helps to identify security vulnerabilities, conduct attack simulations, and potential security breaches by creating a virtual replica of the targeted healthcare systems. In this paper, a novel and automated conceptual framework is developed for reinforcing the cybersecurity in IoT-based healthcare using DT technology. It includes the conceptualization and analysis of the proposed framework which can provide dynamic and adaptive security solution to identify real-time threats and vulnerabilities in IoTbased healthcare applications."
425,Secure Communication via IRIS and PALM Print Validation using Deep BayesianNet,"More and more sensitive information is being moved around the internet, so it is imperative that it be protected during transit. This is especially true of user-enabled private interactions. When it comes to data protection, a biometric security system's ability to use an individual's distinct biological characteristics is unrivalled. In this manner, multi-modal biometric generates more interest than a single biometric identification system. Researchers are interested in multimodal biometric systems' certificates because, compared to those of a unimodal biometric system, they offer advantages like improved accuracy in recognition competence and dependable security. Here, a Hand vein and Iris based multimodal Fingerprint system is designed with Deep Learning. Encrypting the alignment maintaining characteristics, the hand vein based method aims to be more robustly tolerant of the possible fractures, rotating, and translational shifts. As a step towards Palm Vein Identification, a picture processing method is used to examine the vascular pattern of the hand palm vein. Iris biometrics were integrated into the authentication process to further strengthen its reliability. An infrared camera or scanner device is used to collect the palm vein pattern, and this data is then put through four distinct filters. Deep Bayesian Net was used for categorization in the suggested system. Accuracy and discovery time are used as indicators of the system's effectiveness."
443,Adaptive Cybersecurity Monitoring for Resilient Vehicular Architectures,"The use of new technologies in vehicles, such as automation and connectivity, results in the addition of more software components, which in turn increases the potential vulnerabilities and attack surfaces for the vehicle. To address this, cybersecurity monitoring of vehicle fleets is required to detect and respond to potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities. The aim of this research is to explore a technological approach to fleet monitoring using established IT standards and techniques. The approach involves collecting, filtering, and forwarding cybersecurity information from multiple sources within the vehicle by instrumenting the ROS 2-based architecture and integrating these data sources with the log management tool syslog-ng. The logging configuration can be adapted at runtime using a ROS 2 interface that we developed. The approach is demonstrated with our fleet simulation setup “Fleet in the Loop” and a sophisticated data collection in a Knowledge Graph. The approach at hand can be used to seamlessly integrate ROS 2 in common IT monitoring tools and efficiently increase the resilience of vehicles by integrating adaptive security monitoring."
465,The importance of trust in a Layered Sensing construct,"The technological advances of the information age have created both an opportunity and a challenge for military decision makers. At first glance, the variety of data gathered by a multitude of traditional and non-traditional Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors should allow decision makers to better understand their environment and the threat. However, a number of factors tend to erode this advantage. Incompatible data formats, bandwidth limitations, sensor persistence and revisit rates, and multi-level security issues are but a few of the technical challenges that preclude end users from being able to take full advantage of the sensor information. Further, as the amount of sensor data increases, real challenges emerge in identifying the most salient pieces of information, fusing that with other relevant sensor modalities, and rapidly moving this information in a presentation format that does not overwhelm the decision maker. It was this problem space of improving information understanding to increase the situational awareness of decision makers that spawned the Layered Sensing vision. Layered Sensing has grown from an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate initiative into an AFRL effort that seeks to bring fused, multi-source, multi-spectral, multi-dimensional (e.g. cultural, environmental, etc.) information to decision makers consistent with their needs, regardless of their location. The end goal of Layered Sensing is to improve the situational awareness of decision makers by providing them with tailored sensor information. In essence, Layered Sensing is a Sensing Oriented Architecture where the customer can provide or request information tailored to their needs in order to facilitate situational awareness. The benefits of Layered Sensing extend beyond military application. For example, the Department of Homeland Security is one federal agency that could potentially face many of the same information challenge in operations as diverse as providing a common operating picture during a post-Katrina type reconstitution scenario or in fusing multi-source and multi-mode data (e.g. HUMINT, electronic intercepts, etc) in order to track or capture a suspected terrorist. Regardless of who implements a Layered Sensing architecture, the critical attribute of “trust” will have to be addressed - trusted information, trusted communication and trusted sensors. Trust is the sine qua non for any Layered Sensing implementation as it is difficult, if not impossible, to build situational awareness upon inaccurate, misleading, or maliciously modified information. The challenge of instilling and measuring trust in a system has many components. At the sensor node the issue of trust is one of ensuring the sensor works as intended and has not been compromised or co-opted. Between sensors, communications paths must be reliable, secure, and robust enough to recover from equipment degradation or malfunctions. Ideally, the local and global architecture should be autonomic with the ability to optimize sensor and communication performance. Finally, there needs to be a means to measure and portray the overall architecture trust picture status to those who are using it. The use of commercial off-the-shelf equipment, while cost effective, introduces its own trust issues due to uncontrollable supply chains. Relying solely on components from trusted sources is not feasible either economically or practically. As Layered Sensing moves from local architectures supporting an urban scenario to a global scenario the issue of complexity will arise. Seamlessly integrating a large number of spatially and temporally distributed heterogeneous sensors will require effective means to authenticate the new arrivals. Dynamic bandwidth allocation to account for optimal data transmission will also be important. Encompassing all of these trust issues is a way to measure and portray a “trust picture” to users. Instinctively, decision makers weigh the accuracy of data they receive based on their experiences with those data sources. For example, live-feed imagery will likely carry more weight in forming the user's situational awareness of a battle space rather than dated intelligence reports or HUMINT. For sensor derived information, the measure of trust of data is a function of the sensor, the environment it's operating in, the networks transmitting that data, and the fusion engine used to correlate the information. It's important these metrics of trust be available to the decision maker particularly if he/she is predisposed to rely on certain sensors/information sources over others. This conference represents the third time papers and studies have been presented that address the challenges associated with Layered Sensing. The purpose of this presentation is to provide a lead-in that introduces the concepts of Layered Sensing and lays the groundwork for subsequent session papers focused on the various aspects of trust."
469,Thirteen concepts to play it safe with the cloud,"Market trends show advanced usage of safety-critical systems with novel services based on smart data analytics. Customers require continuous updates to applications and services and seek lower costs, and easy-to-install solutions (maintenance) for safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). Leveraging edge and cloud technologies has the potential to enhance safety-critical CPS, also in regulated environments. This is only possible when safety, performance, cybersecurity, and privacy of data are kept at the same level as in on-device only safety-critical CPS.This paper presents thirteen selected safety and performance concepts for distributed device-edge-cloud CPS solutions. This early result of the TRANSACT project aims to ensure needed end-to-end performance and safety levels from an end-user perspective, to extend edge and cloud benefits of more rapid innovation and inclusion of value-added services, also to safety-critical CPS."
474,Boundary Defense Against Cyber Threat for Power System State Estimation,"The operation of power grids is becoming increasingly data-centric. While the abundance of data could improve system efficiency, it poses major reliability challenges. In particular, state estimation aims to find the operating state of a network from the telemetered data, but an undetected attack on the data could lead to making wrong operational decisions for the system and trigger a large-scale blackout. Nevertheless, understanding the vulnerability of state estimation with regards to cyberattacks, which is a special instance of graph-structured quadratic sensing problem, has been hindered by the lack of tools for studying the topological and data-analytic aspects of networks. Algorithmic robustness is critical in extracting reliable information from abundant but untrusted grid data. For a large-scale power grid, we quantify, analyze, and visualize the regions of the network that are not robust to cyberattacks in the sense that there exists a data manipulation strategy for each of those local regions that misleads the operator at the global scale and yields a wrong estimation of the state of the network at almost all buses. We also propose an optimization-based graphical boundary defense mechanism to identify the border of the geographical area in which data have been manipulated. The proposed method does not allow a local attack to have a global effect on the data analysis of the entire network, which enhances the situational awareness of the grid, especially in the face of adversity. The developed mathematical framework reveals key geometric and algebraic factors that can affect algorithmic robustness and is used to study the vulnerability of the U.S. power grid in this paper."
483,Multi-modal Information Fusion-powered Regional Covid-19 Epidemic Forecasting,"With the current raging spread of the COVID19, early forecasting of the future epidemic trend is of great significance to public health security. The COVID-19 is virulent and spreads widely. An outbreak in one region often triggers the spread of others, and regions with relatively close association would show a strong correlation in the spread of the epidemic. In the real world, many factors affect the spread of the outbreak between regions. These factors exist in the form of multimodal data, such as the time-series data of the epidemic, the geographic relationship, and the strength of social contacts between regions. However, most of the current work only uses historical epidemic data or single-modal geographic location data to forecast the spread of the epidemic, ignoring the correlation and complementarity in multi-modal data and its impact on the disease spread between regions. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal InformatioN fusion COVID-19 Epidemic forecasting model (MINE). It fuses inter-regional and intra-regional multi-modal information to capture the temporal and spatial relevance of the COVID-19 spread in different regions. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the best results compared to state-of-art methods on benchmark datasets."
485,Risk-Based Stochastic Scheduling of Resilient Microgrids Considering Demand Response Programs,"In this article, a risk-constrained stochastic framework is presented for joint energy and reserve scheduling of a resilient microgrid considering demand side management. The optimization problem is formulated to schedule the system operation in both normal and islanding modes by addressing the prevailing uncertainties of islanding duration as well as prediction errors of loads, renewable power generation, and electricity price. In a normal operation mode, where the grid-connection is available, the energy and reserve of local resources and energy trading with the main grid is scheduled to maximize the operator's profit considering feasible islanding. In a resilient operating mode, which is triggered by a disturbance in the main grid, the local resources should be scheduled to supply loads with the lowest emergency load shedding. To balance the economy and security requirements under uncertainties, the optimal scheduling is done properly through a security-constrained power flow method by considering system's objectives and constraints. Moreover, to properly handle the uncertainties of the problem, conditional value-at-risk metric is incorporated with the optimization model to control the risk of profit variability. The proposed scheme is implemented on a test microgrid and various case studies are presented to verify its effectiveness in normal and resiliency operating conditions."
494,Towards Adaptive Cybersecurity for Green IoT,"The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has led to an explosion in the number of IoT devices and an exponential rise in carbon footprint incurred by overburdened IoT networks and pervasive cloud/edge communications. Hence, there is a growing interest in industry and academia to enable the efficient use of computing infrastructures by optimizing the management of data center and IoT resources (hardware, software, network, and data) and reducing operational costs to slash greenhouse gas emissions and create healthy environments. Cybersecurity has also been considered in such efforts as a contributor to these environmental issues. Nonetheless, most green security approaches focus on designing low-overhead encryption schemes and do not emphasize energy-efficient security from architectural and deployment viewpoints. This paper sheds light on the emerging paradigm of adaptive cybersecurity as one of the research directions to support sustainable computing in green IoT. It presents three potential research directions and their associated methods for designing and deploying adaptive security in green computing and resource-constrained IoT environments to save on energy consumption. Such efforts will transform the development of data-driven IoT security solutions to be greener and more environment-friendly."
512,A Moving Target Defense Strategy for Internet of Things Cybersecurity,"Internet of Things (IoT) systems are becoming more common and present in our daily lives. The increase of Internet-connected devices has caused attackers to focus their attention more on these devices. Therefore, new and more sophisticated attacks on IoT systems are discovered every day. Currently, to ensure reliability and operability, most IoT systems are designed to operate in a relatively static configuration in a highly heterogeneous environment. However, a system that does not continuously change its configurations, i.e., a static system, gives an advantage to attackers; with enough time and resources, an attacker will eventually find and exploit the vulnerabilities of any static target. This work proposes a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy that randomly shuffles the communication protocols through which a node communicates to a gateway in an IoT network. The system’s configuration changes have an associated cost. The objective of the proposed MTD strategy in this work is to balance the increase in system performance overhead, the increase in business impact (system unavailability), and, at the same time, the decrease in the probability of success of a given attack. A framework is proposed to design this strategy; this framework can guide any MTD strategy for IoT systems. The framework’s objective is to find, after several iterations, the MTD strategy parameters that achieve a balance between five different measurable variables of an IoT system."
532,Self-supervised Multi-Modal Video Forgery Attack Detection,"Video forgery attacks threaten surveillance systems by replacing the video captures with unrealistic synthesis, which can be powered by the latest augmented reality and virtual reality technologies. From the machine perception aspect, visual objects often have RF signatures that are naturally synchronized with them during recording. In contrast to video captures, the RF signatures are more difficult to attack given their concealed and ubiquitous nature. In this work, we investigate multimodal video forgery attack detection methods using both visual and wireless modalities. Since wireless signal-based human perception is environmentally sensitive, we propose a self-supervised training strategy to enable the system to work without external annotation and thus adapt to different environments. Our method achieves a perfect human detection accuracy and a high forgery attack detection accuracy of 94.38% which is comparable with supervised methods. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ChuiZhao/Secure-Mask.git"
534,Multiple coordinated views for network attack graphs,"While efficient graph-based representations have been developed for modeling combinations of low-level network attacks, relatively little attention has been paid to effective techniques for visualizing such attack graphs. This paper describes a number of new attack graph visualization techniques, each having certain desirable properties and offering different perspectives for solving different kinds of problems. Moreover, the techniques we describe can be applied not only separately, but can also be combined into coordinated attack graph views. We apply improved visual clustering to previously described network protection domains (attack graph cliques), which reduces graph complexity and makes the overall attack flow easier to understand. We also visualize the attack graph adjacency matrix, which shows patterns of network attack while avoiding the clutter usually associated with drawing large graphs. We show how the attack graph adjacency matrix concisely conveys the impact of network configuration changes on attack graphs. We also describe a novel attack graph filtering technique based on the interactive navigation of a hierarchy of attack graph constraints. Overall, our techniques scale quadratically with the number of machines in the attack graph."
544,Cyber-physical and networked sensor systems: Challenges and opportunities,"Rapid advancements in embedded systems, sensors and wireless communication technologies have led to the development of cyber-physical systems, pervasive computing and smart environments with important applications such as smart grids, sustainability, health care and security. Wireless sensor networks play significant role in building such systems as they can effectively act as the human-physical interface with the digital world through sensing, communication, computing and control or actuation. However, the inherent characteristics of wireless sensor networks, typified by resource constraints, high degree of uncertainty, heterogeneity and distributed control pose significant challenges. After introducing the basic challenges, opportunities and applications, this talk will present a novel framework for multi-modal context recognition from sensor streaming data, context-aware data fusion, and situation-aware decision making with a trade-off between information accuracy (hence inference quality) and energy consumption. The underlying approach is based on dynamic Bayesian model, information theoretic reasoning, and game theory. The talk will be concluded with open issues and future directions of research."
554,Resilient Wide-Area Damping Control to Mitigate Strong Cyber Attack: A Multiple-Controller Switching Approach,"The growing risk of cyber attacks targeting wide-area damping control (WADC) has spawned much research on designing attack-resilient controllers recently. However, the issue of attack strength did not get enough attention so that most existing resilient WADCs may fail to defend strong attacks. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multiple-controller switching approach based resilient wide-area damping controller (MCS-RWADC) to suppress inter-area oscillations and mitigate strong attacks. It is inclusive of multiple secure networked prediction control based modules (SNPMs) and a switch-monitor module (MSM). The SNPM can detect attacks, differentiate attack strength and compensate for weak attacks. In terms of strong attacks, multiple SNPMs are implemented to work as backup and three operating states as well as the corresponding switching rules are designed to realize automatic switching among them. MSM is responsible for monitoring the states and directing the switching. Case studies are conducted on a 4-area 5-terminal voltage source converter-based multi-terminal high voltage direct current based offshore wind farm integration system. Simulation results verify MCS-RWADC cannot only suppress the inter-area oscillation but also handle the strong attacks under a wide range of operating conditions with various wind power output."
556,Data and Decision Intelligence for Internet of Things: Putting Human in the Loop,"The requirement and expanding needs of bridging the physical and cyber world promote the emergence of a new global internet-based information architecture, the Internet of Things. The main challenge in Internet of Things is how to make fast and accurate decisions based on multi-modal sensing data. In this paper, we put human into the process and formulate a closed-loop computing paradigm for IoT data and decision intelligence. We first propose a human-in-the-loop reference model, which extends the traditional cyber-physical interaction extended into a closed-loop process based on cyber, physical and human three factors. We defined the three-factor decision paradigm in the model. On the basis of the reference model, we analyze the feature requirement in the data intelligent process and summarize it as three key aspects: semantic, interactive and iterative. Further, we analyze several major challenges facing IoT data and decision intelligence from the perspective of data characteristics. We select and review the recent progress in three typical application domains and analyzed whether the current research has solved the target issues. According to the results of the review and analysis, the paper finally summarizes and addresses some key research directions in the future."
576,SMTR® module - Evolution towards airborne applications,"Modern active electronically steered antennas (AESA) operate in different platforms and systems. Inside AIRBUS Defence & Space, the focus on X-band antennas today is on airborne and fighter nose radars, in satellite based SAR antennas (synthetic aperture radar) for earth observation, and ground surveillance and security radars. Active airborne antennas are assembled with hundreds or even thousands of transmit/receive modules. This paper will describe the evolution of the so-called standardized module solution based on LTCC package technology with special regard to airborne applications and the correlated needs. This evolution especially contains significant optimization steps concerning area, weight and cost. By realization of an SMTR® Module suitable to a folded plank concept a significant reduction of installation depth could be achieved. As the module weight is dominated by its package, technology evaluation and implementation of advantageous concepts and materials was performed, here. Cost reduction is always a key focus of T/R module evolution as the modules still allocate a big part of antenna's production cost. Some steps have been realised here both on technology and component level. The next generation of AESA antennas will result in a combination of different operating modes within the same antenna front end, including radar, communication (data links), and jamming (electronic warfare, EW). This leads to enhanced demands especially towards the MMICs. The RF section of today's T/R modules for AESA applications is typically based on GaAs technology. During the last 10 years there was much progress in the development of disruptive semiconductor materials, especially GaN and SiGe BiCMOS, which have the potential to challenge or even replace the GaAs technology, here. This paper will describe and show this evolution through the last years and shall give an outlook towards future developments with regard to airborne applications."
609,Dynamic Security Domain Scaling on Embedded Symmetric Multiprocessors,"We propose a method for dynamic security-domain scaling on SMPs that offers both highly scalable performance and high security for future high-end embedded systems. Its most important feature is its highly efficient use of processor resources, accomplished by dynamically changing the number of processors within a security-domain (i.e., dynamically yielding processors to other security-domains) in response to application load requirements. Two new technologies make this scaling possible without any virtualization software: (1) self-transition management and (2) unified virtual address mapping. Evaluations show that this domain control provides highly scalable performance and incurs almost no performance overhead in security-domains. The increase in OSs in binary code size is less than 1.5%, and the time required for individual state transitions is on the order of a single millisecond. This scaling is the first in the world to make possible the dynamic changing of the number of processors within a security-domain on an ARM SMP."
626,Automatic Testing of Inconsistency Caused by Improper Error Handling: A Safety and Security Perspective,"Object oriented programming language provides structured way of handling error through Exception handling mechanism. Exception handling must be carefully programmed, it may leave the application in inconsistent state. Inconsistency happens when state change by the program is not reverted to its consistent state in case of exceptions. Inconsistent state can have serious side effects, it may corrupt the system or may lead to software crashes. It may be misused by the attacker to make the system down or intentionally corrupt the system. Researchers have proposed several methods to protect inconsistency developed due to exceptions. Very few techniques have been developed to test the inconsistencies in the system. In this paper we have proposed a method to automatically detect the inconsistency in the system."
653,Adaptively secure multi-authority attribute-based broadcast encryption in fog computing,"Fog computing is considered an important development in cloud computing, with shorter response times, less data transfer load and a more secure distributed service architecture that can be accessed by a wide range of end devices. As with cloud computing, it also faces the challenge of how to securely distribute sensitive data. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based Broadcast Encryption (CP-ABBE) can protect sensitive data and provide fine-grained access control with user revocation. However, existing CP-ABBE schemes suffer many limitations when implemented in a fog computing environment: a single authority performs poorly in handling requests or data from many IoT devices, leading to system delays or limited functionality; expensive decryption costs make the computation and storage overheads unfriendly to devices with limited resources; these schemes are only proven selectively secure, meaning that security was proven in a weaker model. In this paper, using threshold secret sharing and decryption delegation, we propose an adaptively secure attribute-based multi-authority broadcast encryption (MA-ABBE) scheme that breaks through these limitations. The comparison and analysis results show that our scheme is practical and achieves adaptive security, enables user-side fast decryption and low storage overhead, and provides a secure and efficient option for protecting sensitive data in fog computing environments. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."
661,Cyber- physical power system reliability assessment considering multi-state independent components,"The reliability indices of composite power systems are vital to supplier companies and planners. With the rapid utilization of information and communication technologies (ICTs), smart power networks include both cyber and physical components. Considering the effects of the cyber elements is unavoidable for the accurate evaluation of system reliability. This paper aims to assess the reliability indices of the composite power systems at the substation level using the most probable configurations of the network. To cover the interdependency between the cyber and physical component's state, all possible events due to the failure of cyber elements are evaluated and a multi-state model instead of a two-state model is computed for each physical component. An algorithm is applied to select the most probable configurations of the system. In addition, the effect of utilizing the dynamic thermal rating (DTR) system, in which the rating of the system components can be improved safely, is considered in the proposed model. Finally, loss of load probability (LOLP), and expected energy not supply (EENS) as the reliability indices are calculated after evaluating the saved failure configurations applying an optimal DC load flow. The proposed approach is applied to the Roy Billinton Test System (RBTS) and the IEEE-24 buses as the small and large test networks respectively. The results show the efficiency of the proposed approach in determining the most probable system configurations and computing the reliability indices with high accuracy. The achieved results reveal that the most probable failure configuration of the system is the state in which the failure occurred in physical components and the cyber elements operate successfully. However, the most severe configuration occurred due to the unsuccessful operation of process buses (PBs) in substations. Furthermore, the reliability indices are improved significantly considering the DTR system instead of the static thermal rating (STR) system. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."
676,Research and application of adaptive security management and control framework for multi-party cloud complex environment of electric power,"With the rapid development of digital transformation of power enterprises and the widespread application of cloud computing, there is a coexistence of multi-party cloud and non-cloud environments in the information network. The original security boundary has been continuously extended, and the security team is facing the problems of increased protection difficulty and reduced management efficiency. In order to solve the problem, this paper proposes an adaptive security management and control framework for multi-party cloud and non-cloud environments, based on software-defined and a unified resource model. First, a unified cloud security resource model is proposed. Then, by instantiating the elements of the unified cloud security resource model, an adaptive security management and control framework is built for the power multi-party cloud complex environment. Finally, the application of the linkage blocking scenario of the firewall on the cloud and outside the cloud is designed and implemented. © 2023 SPIE."
681,Multi-Modal Noise-Robust DDoS Attack Detection Architecture in Large-Scale Networks Based on Tensor SVD,"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks consumes the resources of traditional or cloud computing networks, resulting in the network unable to provide normal services. Therefore, accurate detection of DDoS attacks can avoid greater losses and provide an important guarantee for network space security. But with the rapid development of the Internet, the network scale is becoming larger and larger, and the structure is becoming more and more complex. Network data shows large-scale heterogeneous characteristics, which lead to data processing becomes more difficult and the traditional algorithms cannot accurately identify attack traffic. Therefore, how to accurately and efficiently detect DDoS attacks in large-scale networks has become a new challenge. To deal this problem, this paper proposes a novel DDoS attack detection framework. Which has mainly made three contributions: (i) Representation of large-scale heterogeneous network data by tensor; (ii) A multi-modal denoising algorithm based on tensor SVD is proposed; (iii) An efficient anomaly detection architecture suitable for large-scale networks is proposed, which combines (i), (ii) and XGBoost classification model. Experiments show that the framework can achieve a high detection rate of 98.84%, and has the characteristics of well extendable, strong noise-robust and fast detection speed.  © 2013 IEEE."
704,Multi-modal cyber security based object detection by classification using deep learning and background suppression techniques,"Foreground object recognition in video is critical in many computer vision applications and automated video surveillance systems. Object detection and tracking are critical steps in navigation, object recognition and surveillance schemes. Object detection is process of separating foreground and background items in photographs. In this paper, we proposes a framework for achieving these tasks with the enhanced cyber security control facility. This proposed algorithmperformed in 2 stages: multi-object detection utilizing the Cyber secure Probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model (Cy_SPGMM) and background suppression and another stage is multiple moving objects tracking utilizing Kernel convoluted moving window with Kalman filter (KCMW_KF). It can, however, deal with a variety of video sequences in the MOT 20 dataset. The experimental findings reveal that the proposed algorithm detects and tracks foreground objects in complex and dynamic scenarios with high accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. This method also produces smoothened images without noise. © 2022"
708,Specification and adaptive verification of access control policy for cyber-physical-social spaces,"Cyber-Physical-Social Space (CPSS) is a promising paradigm to provide people with an intelligent environment by emphasizing the deep fusion of cyberspace, physical space, and social space. The interdependence of these spaces makes that CPSS is more likely to be attacked. The attack consequences may directly affect the state of the physical world and even endanger the people's life. Thus, the most challenging issue for CPSS is to ensure the space security. However, existing security analysis methods focus on the static analysis at the design phase. They do not consider the open and dynamic characteristics which are the core features of CPSS. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security analysis framework for CPSS to prevent the unauthorized flow of information. Firstly, the access control model of CPSS is proposed. It controls the access behaviors by considering the space information covering the social, cyber, and physical spaces. Secondly, Labelled Transition System (LTS) is established to describe the future evolutions of CPSS. The space states in the LTS which violate the security requirements are reasoned by the model checking technology. Thirdly, a policy adjustment method is proposed to prevent the system from entering the violated states or mitigate the bad results caused by the violations. In the end, the effectiveness of our approach is evaluated by a smart building case, and the necessity of our approach is analyzed by the performance evaluation. © 2021"

755,"An adaptive, situation-based risk assessment and security enforcement framework for the maritime sector","Maritime processes involve actors and systems that continuously change their underlying environment, location and threat exposure. Thus, risk mitigation requires a dynamic risk assessment process, coupled with an adaptive, event driven security enforcement mechanism, to efficiently deal with dynamically evolving risks in a cost efficient manner. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security framework that covers both situational risk assessment and situational driven security policy deployment. We extend MITIGATE, a maritime-specific risk assessment methodology, to capture situations in the risk assessment process and thus produce fine-grained and situation-specific, dynamic risk estimations. Then, we integrate DynSMAUG, a situation-driven security management system, to enforce adaptive security policies that dynamically implement security controls specific to each situation. To validate the proposed framework, we test it based on maritime cargo transfer service. We utilize various maritime specific and generic systems employed during cargo transfer, to produce dynamic risks for various situations. Our results show that the proposed framework can effectively assess dynamic risks per situation and automate the enforcement of adaptive security controls per situation. This is an important improvement in contrast to static and situation-agnostic risk assessment frameworks, where security controls always default to worst-case risks, with a consequent impact on the cost and the applicability of proper security controls. © 2021 by the authors.

760,A Survey of IoT Software Platforms,"In the last few years an outbreak of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions have been placed in service around the globe giving rise to a multi-billion market size. IoT software platforms are evolving as the main pillar for the rapid development of scalable and efficient IoT applications. Such platforms are offering end-to-end services including connectivity between smart objects and cloud infrastructures, scalable storage as well as programming frameworks and data analytics to create valuable insights for new business use cases. This paper proposes a broad evaluation scheme for IoT software platforms based on an analysis of the characteristics found in contemporary platforms that are surveyed. The evaluation criteria are organized into four categories: core (Connectivity, Device Management, Integration APIs, Security, Endorsed Hardware, Hosting), data management and processing (Storage, Multi-Modal Support, Analytics, Visualization), application empowerment (Event-driven Actions, Push Notifications, Programming Frameworks, Third Party Integration), and accessibility (Pricing, Support). A comparative analysis of state of-the-art IoT software platforms is conducted based on the defined criteria followed by a critical presentation of fundamental features, commonalities and differences between them.

772,An online tripping index to improve microgrid dynamic stability based on estimating critical boundary area,"This paper presents an online index for adaptive protection of microgrids concerning the low inertia concept. A three-step approach is developed to consider two offline and online environments, and the proposed scheme is designed. In Step-1, a comprehensive study of the microgrid dynamical model is investigated through two different distributed energy resources (DERs), including generator-based and inverter-based resources. In this step, based on the low-inertia concept, a dynamical model of an adaptive protection scheme is proposed through a set of non-model-based indexes. In Step-2, considering online evaluations of produced indexes, two different equations are provided in the form activation point and triggering point which the corresponding adaptive protective zones are provided. In this step, considering different operational and topological points of microgrid, the protective abilities of proposed indexes are validated and reorganized. Finally Step-3 concentrates on the ability of the proposed defensive scheme in real-time operating mode. In this step, considering different fault scenarios, the accuracy estimation and fast detection of the developed protection scheme are investigated, and the microgrid dynamic security is evaluated. Results present the effectuality of the proposed scheme to fast and secure detection of unstable scenarios using adaptive non-model-based signals concerning different system structures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
779,Privacy-Preserving Flexible Access Control for Encrypted Data in Internet of Things,"Along with the development of edge computing and the cloud, the Internet of Things (IoT) is affecting and changing people's lives. Data sharing has played an important role in the IoT, but the leakage of private user information poses a new security threat to the users. Thus, flexible fine-grained access control for such shared data is proposed in this article as an effective and secure method of eliminating vulnerabilities. However, the disclosure of access policies will also expose users' private information. Recently, Yang et al. attempted to solve this problem and proposed a framework based on attribute-based encryption for shared data onto IEEE IoT-J(DOI: 10.1109/JIOT.2016.2571718). They hide the access policies by using a bloom filter (BF) and attempt to address privacy preservation in IoT. However, we demonstrate several security weaknesses of their framework and point out its vulnerability to dictionary attacks and access policy guessing attacks. Then, an improved IoT solution is proposed. Under this proposal, the attribute values are stored in BF while the attribute names are embedded in the access policy. The proposed scheme can resist dictionary attacks and access policy guessing attacks. In addition, it simultaneously realizes large attribute sets, an efficient decryption algorithm, and adaptive security. Security analysis and performance evaluations show that the presented scheme achieves higher security and implementation simplicity in the IoT than other currently available schemes.  © 2014 IEEE."
781,Reliability and optimal triggering policy for multi-state systems subject to shocks and supported by a protective device,"Failures of safety-critical systems could result in irretrievable economic loss and significant environmental damage. To mitigate the failure risk of safety-critical systems, a protective device is commonly designed to alleviate the damage caused by external shocks. In this paper, a multi-state system subject to shocks and supported by a protective device is considered. The protective device can be triggered to defense valid shocks when the system state is worse than a predetermined threshold. During the operating process of the protective device, the system is assumed to be failure-free due to the resistant effect of the protective device. After resisting a finite number of valid shocks for the system, the protective device loses the protective ability. A finite Markov chain imbedding method is employed to derive the system reliability characteristics. Based on the established reliability model, the state based triggering policy of the protective device is designed and an optimization model is constructed to determine the optimal triggering threshold. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed model and obtained results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
784,Convolutional neural network-based feature extraction using multimodal for high security application,"An efficient biometrics-based security system is the prime need in modern security industry.

796,Reverse Firewalls for Adaptively Secure MPC Without Setup,"We study Multi-party computation (MPC) in the setting of subversion, where the adversary tampers with the machines of honest parties. Our goal is to construct actively secure MPC protocols where parties are corrupted adaptively by an adversary (as in the standard adaptive security setting), and in addition, honest parties’ machines are compromised. The idea of reverse firewalls (RF) was introduced at EUROCRYPT’15 by Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz as an approach to protecting protocols against corruption of honest parties’ devices. Intuitively, an RF for a party P is an external entity that sits between P and the outside world and whose scope is to sanitize P ’s incoming and outgoing messages in the face of subversion of their computer. Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz constructed a protocol for passively-secure two-party computation. At CRYPTO’20, Chakraborty, Dziembowski and Nielsen constructed a protocol for secure computation with firewalls that improved on this result, both by extending it to multi-party computation protocol, and considering active security in the presence of static corruptions. In this paper, we initiate the study of RF for MPC in the adaptive setting. We put forward a definition for adaptively secure MPC in the reverse firewall setting, explore relationships among the security notions, and then construct reverse firewalls for MPC in this stronger setting of adaptive security. We also resolve the open question of Chakraborty, Dziembowski and Nielsen by removing the need for a trusted setup in constructing RF for MPC. Towards this end, we construct reverse firewalls for adaptively secure augmented coin tossing and adaptively secure zero-knowledge protocols and obtain a constant round adaptively secure MPC protocol in the reverse firewall setting without setup. Along the way, we propose a new multi-party adaptively secure coin tossing protocol in the plain model, that is of independent interest. © 2021, International Association for Cryptologic Research."
817,A design of multi-element anti-jamming gps antenna,"Background: With the development of the application of GPS satellite, the requirement of anti-jamming and integration for navigation receiving terminal is gradually raised. In terms of anti-jamming performance, because the satellite signal arrives at the ground with weak intensity and is vulnerable to electromagnetic interference, the positioning results are not available. Objective: Therefore, in complex electromagnetic environment, the anti-jamming navigation receiving terminal is needed, and the interference nulling or beam pointing can be achieved by using mul-ti-element antenna array with anti-jamming algorithm. Methods: Accordingly to requirements, the development trend of navigation receiving terminal is from single mode to multi-mode and miniaturization. A miniaturized 7-element anti-jamming antenna array is proposed. It mainly aims at GPS L1 and L2 frequency points. All elements adopt ce-ramic substrate microstrip antenna. The array elements adopt laminated design to effectively reduce the antenna aperture. The spacing between elements at two frequency points is not greater than half wavelength, which can ensure the back-end anti-jamming algorithm performance, and its performance and characteristics are verified through related experiments and simulations. Results: Anti-jamming algorithm performance, and its performance and characteristics are verified through related experiments and simulations. Conclusion: The designed multi-element antenna can be used in the anti-jamming application. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers."
821,"How to secure autonomous mobile robots? An approach with fuzzing, detection and mitigation","Autonomous mobile robots share social spaces with humans, usually working together for domestic or professional tasks. Cyber security breaches in such robots undermine the trust between humans and robots. In this paper, we investigate how to apprehend and inflict security threats at the design and implementation stage of an autonomous mobile robot. To this end, we leverage the idea of directed fuzzing and design ROBOFUZZthat systematically tests an autonomous mobile robot in line with the robot's states and the surrounding environment. The methodology of ROBOFUZZis to study critical environmental parameters affecting the robot's state transitions and subject the robot control program with rational but harmful sensor values so as to compromise the robot. Furthermore, we develop detection and mitigation algorithms to counteract the impact of ROBOFUZZ. The difficulties mainly lie in the trade-off among limited computation resources, timely detection and the retention of work efficiency in mitigation. In particular, we propose detection and mitigation methods that take advantage of historical records of obstacles to detect inconsistent obstacle appearances regarding untrustworthy sensor values and navigate the movable robot to continue moving so as to carry on a planned task. By doing so, we manage to maintain a low cost for detection and mitigation but also retain the robot's work efficacy. We have prototyped the bundle of ROBOFUZZ, detection and mitigation algorithms in a real-world movable robot. Experimental results confirm that ROBOFUZZmakes a success rate of up to 93.3% in imposing concrete threats to the robot while the overall loss of work efficacy is merely 4.1% at the mitigation mode. © 2020"
869,Optimised adaptive control methodology for mode transition of hybrid electric vehicle based on the dynamic characteristics analysis,"Mode transition plays an important role in the operation of hybrid electric vehicles. The clutch is a key actuator for mode transition, but friction resulting from its use makes it difficult to achieve seamless mode transition. Moreover, as is usual in an electromechanical coupling system, the hybrid powertrain may exhibit complex dynamic behaviours as operating parameters change during mode transition. This paper considered changes in the clutch friction coefficient, and established a mathematical model of the hybrid powertrain in a parallel-series hybrid electric vehicle (PSHEV) during mode transition. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion and bifurcation theory are introduced to analyse the influence of speed difference on the dynamic characteristics of the hybrid powertrain, and the corresponding instability threshold were given. Furthermore, an optimised adaptive control methodology was proposed to control the dynamic behaviours, and tests on PSHEV were carried out. The results show that the variations of speed difference may lead to the occurrence of Fold and Hopf bifurcations, and that once the speed difference reaches the instability threshold, it may cause the system to enter a chaotic state and exhibit random oscillation. The proposed control methodology can effectively expand the security domain and suppress the oscillation to improve smoothness of mode transition. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
884,Periodic surveillance test strategies to effectively enhance the availability of safety-critical systems in NPPs using the multi-state based availability model,"We present effective periodic surveillance test (PST) strategies enhancing the availability of nuclear safety systems with three-channel configuration in PWR (Pressurized Water Reactor), which can be used in limited space applications. The suggested PST strategies are about testing the system with the optimal surveillance test interval, the different way depending on the system operation time and testing each module in the system using the loaded test scenarios continuously and automatically. To analyze the quantitative effects of proposed PST strategies on the availability, we develop the multi-state based availability model based on the Markov model, which exactly describes the behavior of the module as well as the system level and enables the complex interrelationship among the availability parameters to be modeled systematically. Using the developed model, the unavailability with the suggested PST strategies is reduced to 47.56% compared to with the conventional PST methods. Also we show that the availability of safety-critical systems in NPPs with three-channel configuration using proposed the test strategies can be higher than that of four-channel configuration with conventional PST methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
943,"Simulated robotic device malfunctions resembling malicious cyberattacks impact human perception of trust, satisfaction, and frustration","Robot assistants and wearable devices are highly useful; however, these artificial systems are susceptible to hackers. In this article, two sets of experiments were conducted. The first part of this study simulated a malicious attack on a prosthetic arm system to adversely affect the operation of the prosthetic system, while the perception of 10 human subjects was surveyed. These 10 able-bodied subjects controlled the prosthetic arm and hand with electromyogram signals, while an artificial sensation of touch was conveyed to their arms as they operated the system, which enabled them to feel what the prosthetic hand was grasping as they were asked to transport an object from one location to another. This haptic feedback was provided in both the normal and abnormal operational modes but was disabled in the extremely abnormal mode. The electromyogram control signals for the arm were reversed in both the abnormal and extremely abnormal modes. Results from the simulated malicious attack on a prosthetic arm system showed that the subjects found the haptic feedback helpful in both the normal and abnormal modes of operation. Both the abnormal and extremely abnormal modes of operation negatively impacted the self-reported levels of trust, satisfaction, and frustration with the prosthetic system as the subjects grasped and transported an object. While these metrics were negatively impacted by system malfunctions resembling a malicious attack on the control functionality, it was possible to rebuild them to their former higher levels after the functionality of the prosthetic system was restored. A parallel study in this article involved simulating a malicious attack on a robot assistant to unfavorably affect the delivery operation modes, while the perception of 20 human subjects was surveyed. Results showed that the simulated malfunctions unfavorably impacted the perception of trust, satisfaction, and frustration, but it was possible to restore these metrics in two different ways as the device functionality was restored. © The Author(s) 2019."
951,Identity-as-a-service: An adaptive security infrastructure and privacy-preserving user identity for the cloud environment,"In recent years, enterprise applications have begun to migrate from a local hosting to a cloud provider and may have established a business-to-business relationship with each other manually. Adaptation of existing applications requires substantial implementation changes in individual architectural components. On the other hand, users may store their Personal Identifiable Information (PII) in the cloud environment so that cloud services may access and use it on demand. Even if cloud services specify their privacy policies, we cannot guarantee that they follow their policies and will not (accidentally) transfer PII to another party. In this paper, we present Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) as a trusted Identity and Access Management with two requirements: Firstly, IDaaS adapts trust between cloud services on demand. We move the trust relationship and identity propagation out of the application implementation and model them as a security topology. When the business comes up with a new e-commerce scenario, IDaaS uses the security topology to adapt a platform-specific security infrastructure for the given business scenario at runtime. Secondly, we protect the confidentiality of PII in federated security domains. We propose our Purpose-based Encryption to protect the disclosure of PII from intermediary entities in a business transaction and from untrusted hosts. Our solution is compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation and involves the least user interaction to prevent identity theft via the human link. The implementation can be easily adapted to existing Identity Management systems, and the performance is fast. © 2019 by the authors."

For autonomous navigation, it is a need for a calibration method that employs a multi-modal sensors for integrates all sensor coordinate systems. In this paper, we propose a corporate calibration method using a multi-modal sensor module. For this purpose, we use a grid pattern can be extracted from various sensor data and the coordinate system for each sensors is integrated based on the correspondence of extracted corner points using pattern information. The proposed framework has been tested extensively in actual outdoor scenes with our self-developed multi-modal sensor module. The experimental results validate its usefulness and efficiency. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
996,Game-Based Adaptive Risk Management in Wireless Body Area Networks,"With the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) era and the tremendous progress of wireless communications, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have been introduced as a promising technology for remote health monitoring. However, the heterogeneity of IoT technologies, the open nature of wireless networks, and the existence of resource-constrained devices are the main challenges to design burdensome security protocols for WBANs. In this context, scalability, reliability, interoperability, and security requirements need risk-aware and adaptive security solutions that take into account the dynamic context changes. Therefore, a trade-off between risk mitigation actions and network performance can be perceived as a major performance objective. The main purpose of this work is to propose an adaptive risk management framework that considers the WBAN context changes to dynamically select the most appropriate security countermeasure and assess its implementation cost in terms of performance degradation. Furthermore, a case study is discussed to show the impact of adaptive risk assessment on network performance. © 2018 IEEE."
1011,Risk Analysis of Information System Security Based on Distance of Information-State Transition,"The configuration of information system security policy is directly related to the information asset risk, and the configuration required by the classified security protection is able to ensure the optimal and minimum policy in the corresponding security level. Through the random survey on the information assets of multiple departments, this paper proposes the relative deviation distance of security policy configuration as risk measure parameter based on the distance of information-state transition (DIT) theory. By quantitatively analyzing the information asset weight, deviation degree and DIT, we establish the evaluation model for information system. With example analysis, the results prove that this method conducts effective risk evaluation on the information system intuitively and reliably, avoids the threat caused by subjective measurement, and shows performance benefits compared with existing solutions. It is not only theoretically but also practically feasible to realize the scientific analysis of security risk for the information system. © 2018, Wuhan University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
1018,StateDroid: Stateful Detection of Stealthy Atacks in Android Apps via Horn-Clause Verification,"Profit-driven cyber-criminals are motivated to prolong Android malware's lifetime by hiding malicious behaviors from raising suspicion. Stealthy malware has become an emerging challenge to Android security as it can remain undetected for quite a long time. However, traditional defense techniques are insufficient in face of this new threat. Our in-depth study on published malware analysis reports and corresponding code analysis leads to three key observations: 1) a stealthy attack goes through multiple states; 2) state transitions are caused by a sequence of attack actions; 3) an attack action typically involves several Android APIs on different objects. These insights motivate us to design a two-layer finite state machine (FSM) model, named StateDroid, to depict multi-step stealthy attacks in terms of state transitions. Our goal is to reason about various stealthy attacks from an Android app in one pass. However, the heterogeneous characteristics of attack actions make automatic construction of accurate detection model a challenging work. To overcome this obstacle, StateDroid abstracts the semantics of Android APIs and attacks as Horn clauses, and then it automatically constructs the two-layer FSM model via Horn-clause verification. We have developed an open-source prototype of StateDroid and evaluated it extensively with ground truth dataset, 1, 505 Google Play apps, and 1, 369 malicious apps, respectively. The encouraging experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of StateDroid. Our study shows stealthy attacks have been quite common among new-generation malware such as notorious ransomware, and we even identify 7.5% of recent Google Play apps exhibit unexpected stealthy behaviors.  © 2018 ACM."
1027,An improved blp model with more flexibility,"BLP model is a classic security access control model, but its strict rules greatly limit practicality and flexibility of the model. An improved access model with much more flexibility than BLP model is proposed in this paper. Each subject of the model is assigned with a security level range and the security level can be modified according to the content of object dynamically. Comparing with traditional BLP model, the improved model manages a series of security levels which are distinguished by the security level of content been read. The subject can get the security level of each content segment, these contents formed the security level range with the security level of subject together. The improved model is secure because each content segment is meets the state transition functions of traditional BLP model. Eventually, an example is given to show that the improved model is more flexibility than Ott model. © 2016 IEEE."
1045,Securing a Cyber Physical System in Nuclear Power Plants Using Least Square Approximation and Computational Geometric Approach,"In industrial plants such as nuclear power plants, system operations are performed by embedded controllers orchestrated by Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) software. A targeted attack (also termed a control aware attack) on the controller/SCADA software can lead a control system to operate in an unsafe mode or sometimes to complete shutdown of the plant. Such malware attacks can result in tremendous cost to the organization for recovery, cleanup, and maintenance activity. SCADA systems in operational mode generate huge log files. These files are useful in analysis of the plant behavior and diagnostics during an ongoing attack. However, they are bulky and difficult for manual inspection. Data mining techniques such as least squares approximation and computational methods can be used in the analysis of logs and to take proactive actions when required. This paper explores methodologies and algorithms so as to develop an effective monitoring scheme against control aware cyber attacks. It also explains soft computation techniques such as the computational geometric method and least squares approximation that can be effective in monitor design. This paper provides insights into diagnostic monitoring of its effectiveness by attack simulations on a four-tank model and using computation techniques to diagnose it. Cyber security of instrumentation and control systems used in nuclear power plants is of paramount importance and hence could be a possible target of such applications. © 2017"

1085,Adaptive Security for Software Systems,"With continuously changing operational and business needs, system security is one of the key system capabilities that need to be updated as well. Most security engineering efforts focus on engineering security requirements of software systems at design time and existing adaptive security engineering efforts require complex design-time preparation. In this chapter we discuss the needs for adaptive software security, and key efforts in this area. We then introduce a new runtime adaptive security engineering approach, which enables adapting software security capabilities at runtime based on new security objectives, risks/threats, requirements as well as newly reported vulnerabilities. We categorize the source of adaptation in terms of manual adaptation (managed by end users), and automated adaption (automatically triggered by the platform). The new platform makes use of new ideas we built for vulnerability analysis, security engineering using aspect-oriented programming, and model-driven engineering techniques. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

1132,Privacy aware person-specific assisting system for home environment,"As smart homes are being more and more popular, the needs of finding assisting systems which interface between users and home environments are growing. Furthermore, for people living in such homes, elderly and disabled people in particular and others in general, it is totally important to develop devices, which can support and aid them in their ordinary daily life. We focused in this work on sustaining privacy issues of the user during a real interaction with the surrounding home environment. A smart person-specific assistant system for services in home environment is proposed. The role of this system is the assisting of persons by controlling home activities and guiding the adaption of Smart-Home-Human interface towards the needs of the considered person. At the same time the system sustains privacy issues of it's interaction partner. As a special case of medical assisting the system is so implemented, that it provides for elderly or disabled people person-specific medical assistance. The system has the ability of identifying its interaction partner using some biometric features. According to the recognized ID the system, first, adopts towards the needs of recognized person. Second the system represents person-specific list of medicines either visually or auditive. And third the system gives an alarm in the case of taking medicament either later or earlier as normal taking time."
1143,From selective to adaptive security in functional encryption,"In a functional encryption (FE) scheme, the owner of the secret key can generate restricted decryption keys that allow users to learn specific functions of the encrypted messages and nothing else. In many known constructions of FE schemes, security is guaranteed only for messages that are fixed ahead of time (i.e., before the adversary even interacts with the system). This so-called selective security is too restrictive for many realistic applications. Achieving adaptive security (also called full security), where security is guaranteed even for messages that are adaptively chosen at any point in time, seems significantly more challenging. The handful of known adaptively-secure schemes are based on specifically tailored techniques that rely on strong assumptions (such as obfuscation or multilinear maps assumptions) can be transformed into an adaptively-secure one without introducing any additional assumptions. We present a black-box transformation, for both public-key and private-key schemes, making novel use of hybrid encryption, a classical technique that was originally introduced for improving the efficiency of encryption schemes. We adapt the hybrid encryption approach to the setting of functional encryption via a technique for embedding a “hidden execution thread” in the decryption keys of the underlying scheme, which will only be activated within the proof of security of the resulting scheme. As an additional application of this technique, we show how to construct functional encryption schemes for arbitrary circuits starting from ones for shallow circuits (NC1 or even TC0). © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2015."

1151,Multimedia surveillance in event detection: Crowd analytics in hajj,"Multimedia surveillance systems have evolved in recent years to capture, process and analyze multimedia data coming from heterogeneous sensors in the context of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Hajj. Systems in these contexts are often designed to support decision making, such as responding to alerts triggered by sensors and incidents detected by surveillance systems as well as to provide useful information for monitoring and emergency-response teams concerned with health and public safety. Various tools and techniques from different fields such as operations research, computer vision, image and video processing, pattern recognition, and multimedia fusion have contributed to the proliferation of such systems in the context of Hajj. In this paper, a systematic review and synthesis of the representative works that have been done in the field of multimedia surveillance for event detection in Hajj is presented.

1168,Characterization of failure effects on AADL models,"Prior works on model-based Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) automatically generate a FMEA table given the system model, a set of failure modes, and a set of possible effects. The last requirement is critical as bias may occur: since the considered failure effects are restricted to the anticipated ones, unexpected effects - the most interesting ones - are disregarded in the FMEA. In this paper, we propose and investigate formal concepts that aim to overcome this bias. They support the construction of FMEA tables solely based on the system model and the failure modes, i.e., without requiring the set of effects as input. More concretely, given a system specification in the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL), we show how to derive relations that characterize the effects of failures based on the state transition system of that specification. We also demonstrate the benefits and limitations of these concepts on a satellite case study. © 2013 Springer-Verlag."

1205,"Faunus: A flexible middleware for specifying and managing multimodal, multiparty collaborations","Faunus addresses the challenge of specifying and managing complex collaboration sessions. Many entities from various administrative domains orchestrate such sessions. Faunus decouples the entities that specify the session from entities that activate and manage them. It restricts the operations to specific agents using capabilities. It unifies the specification and management operations through its naming system. Each Faunus name is persistent and globally unique. A collection of attributes are attached to each name. Together, they represent a collection of services that form a collaboration session. Anyone can create a name; the creator has full read and write privileges that can be delegated to others. With the proper capability, anyone can modify session attributes between an active and inactive state. Though the system is designed for Internet scale deployments, the security model for providing and revoking capabilities currently assumes an Intranet style deployment. We have incorporated Faunus into a DisplayCast system that originally used Zeroconf. We are incorporating Faunus into another project that will fully exercise the power of Faunus. © 2012 ACM."
1210,Stochastic game net and applications in security analysis for enterprise network,"Stochastic game theoretic framework has been used in many fields of networks with interactive behaviors. However, further use of this framework is limited due to the following reasons. Firstly, it is difficult to build comprehensive and rigorous models for complex network structures by the state-based game model. Secondly, solving and extending the dynamic behaviors of participators of the network are nearly impossible, because of the complexity of state transitions. Last but not least, general game model is not able to describe and analyze specific events and behaviors in some kinds of networks, like enterprise networks. In this paper, we propose a new modeling paradigm (stochastic game net, or SGN) for stochastic games representation with Petri nets. Based on our graphical tool, stochastic game problems can be described clearly, and the model can be solved and extended easily. Moreover, this paper puts forth a series of methods for modeling and analyzing the competitive game by SGN, which is the main contribution of this work. Our achievements are applied to the security analysis for enterprise networks. The analysis results prove the powerful ability of our achievements in solving the complicated and dynamic game problems. Furthermore, our approaches can be used to calculate the existence and the value of an equilibrium point. © 2011 Springer-Verlag."
1268,Security and mobility of intermodal freight networks,"The conceptual framework and design of specific vital components of a simulation-assignment tool for assessing the impact of potential security measures on mobility and demand in an intermodal freight system are proposed. A multimodal freight network simulator is employed within the tool to model terminal delays and consolidation policies at classification yards, intermodal transfer terminals, and ports, as well as train and waterways service networks. The development of this tool is motivated by security and mobility concerns in the critically vital northeastern region of the United States, with a focus on intermodal freight movements in the Washington, D.C.-New York City (DC-NY) freight corridor as a model for the rest of the nation. This tool provides a core analysis capability for security implementation proposals and disaster scenarios in this corridor. It provides a state-of-the-art test bed for analyzing new technologies and potential measures to improve security that may simultaneously improve efficiency and mobility. This paper describes the platform, core components, and key capabilities, as well as modeling techniques, for security implementation evaluation and postdisaster damage assessment within the DC-NY freight corridor."
1283,Building test cases and oracles to automate the testing of web database applications,"Many organizations rely on web applications that use back-end databases to store important data. Testing such applications requires significant effort. Manual testing alone is often impractical, so testers also rely on automated testing techniques. However, current automated testing techniques may produce false positives (or false negatives) even in a perfectly working system because the outcome of a test case depends on the state of the database which changes over time as data is inserted and deleted. The Automatic Database Tester (AutoDBT) generates functional test cases that account for database updates. AutoDBT takes as input a model of the application and a set of testing criteria. The model consists of a state transition diagram that shows how users navigate pages, a data specification that captures how data flows, and an update specification that shows how the database is updated. AutoDBT generates guard queries to determine whether the database is in a state conducive to performing and evaluating tests. AutoDBT also generates partial oracles to help validate whether a back-end database is updated correctly during testing. This paper describes the design of AutoDBT, a prototype implementation, several experiments with the prototype, and four case studies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

1321,Efficient software model checking of data structure properties,"This paper presents novel language and analysis techniques that significantly speed up software model checking of data structure properties. Consider checking a red-black tree implementation. Traditional software model checkers systematically generate all red-black tree states (within some given bounds) and check every red-black tree operation (such as insert, delete, or lookup) on every red-black tree state. Our key idea is as follows. As our checker checks a red-black tree operation o on a red-black tree state s, it uses program analysis techniques to identify other red-black tree states s' 1, s'2, ..., s'k on which the operation o behaves similarly. Our analyses guarantee that if o executes correctly on s, then o will execute correctly on every s'i. Our checker therefore does not need to check o on any s'i once it checks o on s. It thus safely prunes those state transitions from its search space, while still achieving complete test coverage within the bounded domain. Our preliminary results show orders of magnitude improvement over previous approaches. We believe our techniques can make model checking significantly faster, and thus enable checking of much larger programs and complex program properties than currently possible. Copyright © 2006 ACM."
1360,Software intensive systems safety analysis,"Two important elements in the avionics suite of modern aircraft are: the Flight Control System (FCS) and the Flight Management System (FMS). The FCS provides the capability to stabilize and control the aircraft, while the FMS is responsible for flight planning and navigation. A clear trend in the aerospace industry is to place greater reliance on software systems, and many FCS and FMS subsystems are implemented primarily in software. For example, within the FCS is the Flight Guidance System (FGS) that generates roll and pitch guidance commands. Similarly, within the FMS is the Vertical Navigation (VNAV) function that acts like a third crew member in the cockpit, ordering mode change requests and resetting target altitude values to enable the aircraft to track the vertical flight plan. We have developed formal, executable models of the requirements for the mode logic of a FGS and for portions of the VNAV functionality. We have also conducted a comprehensive software safety analysis on the FGS mode logic model, and are completing the analysis of the VNAV model. This analysis uses as its starting point several ""traditional"" safety analysis techniques such as a Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA), a Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), and a Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA). However, we are also using formal methods techniques known as model checking and theorem proving to verify the presence of safety properties in the model. This paper summarizes the (now completed) safety analysis that was performed on the FGS model, and highlights the similarities and differences with the (still on-going) safety analysis of the FMS model. In particular, we summarize progress made to date in the use of formal methods to verify the presence of the required safety properties in the models themselves."

1373,Steady-state security prediction in presence of load uncertainty,"An important problem in the Electrical Power System operation is the steady-state security prediction. In order to take into account the load uncertainty, in this paper the authors apply a Monte-Carlo method together with an opportune Security Index to evaluate in a preventive manner the probability to fall in insecure operating state, by determining the security index probability density function. For this aim, in a previous paper proposed by the authors, it has been possible to take advantage of an Artificial Neural Network, trained to evaluate the Security Index probability density function in presence of the optimal economical dispatching of the generation powers for the load forecast. In the present paper, a more complex scenario is considered where the security analysis can suggest to the dispatcher to determine also non-optimal economical operating conditions to improve security. So a new, more complex, organization of the Artificial Neural Network training stage, necessary in order to obtain increased generalization capacity in the production stage, has been considered. In the first part of the paper the used security index, the Monte-Carlo simulation and the neural network structure with its learning algorithm utilized by the authors for the particular problem are briefly recalled. Finally, a numerical application on a simple electrical test system is shown pointing out very encouraging results."

1424,Design and analysis of self-protection: Adaptive security for software-intensive systems,"Today’s software landscape features a high degree of complexity, frequent change and many uncertainties. Cyber-attacks are a common occurrence and their consequences are often severe, thus, systems that are able to dynamically defend themselves from attacks are highly needed. Such systems are called self-protecting systems and aim to autonomously identify, analyse and mitigate threats by adapting their structure and behavior at runtime. This research project will contribute towards providing software-intensive systems with self-protection or adaptive-security capabilities. We enhance the security of architecture-based self-adaptive systems by equipping them with (proactive and reactive) self-protection capabilities as well as attack monitoring. Moreover, we provide a framework that allows an open, decentralized system system to mitigate security threats and self-organize to maximize the average trust between the system entities while maintaining their security policies. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

1429,Generation III commercial nuclear reactor cybersecurity,"New build commercial nuclear power plants worldwide have evolved from Generation II (Gen II) designs to Generation III (Gen III). Gen III reactor architectures are predominately digital, increasing the industrial cybersecurity threat landscape when compared with Gen II designs. Nuclear plant cyber and physical security organizations are tasked with protecting nuclear power plants against any action, intentional or accidental, that could lead to radiological release. Regulatory requirements for cybersecurity protection of digital communications and computer equipment associated with safety, security, emergency preparedness, and support systems critical to plant operations and safe reactor shutdown are included in applications for operating licenses in different countries. Cybersecurity for Gen III reactors entails the same methodologies used for Gen II reactors. The divergence between Gen II and Gen III cybersecurity is the number of digital assets requiring protection. Gen III units may have as many as double or triple the number of digital assets that Gen II reactors have. Additionally, instrumentation and control (I&C) configuration changes and significant modifications to control room architecture for Gen III models require detailed assessments to determine appropriate cybersecurity controls for protecting digital assets while not interfering with operations. Critical infrastructure malicious cyber actors have demonstrated their objectives of disrupting physical processes in Operational Technology (OT) environments through successful compromises such as power grid attacks, penetration and destruction of centrifuges in nuclear enrichment facilities, and other cyber-attacks. Therefore, cybersecurity defense of OT environments in Gen III nuclear power plants is essential in order to protect the public and the environment from potential radiological release that could result from a damaging cyber-attack. © 2018 PBNC 2018 - Pacific Basin Nuclear Conference.All Rights Reserved."
1452,Concepts for the improvement of supply chain efficiency and security,"Modern supply chains have a large number of transport phases and actors involved, and face many security risks. This paper presents a discussion and new concepts for management of the multimodal supply chains and transport unit security. The paper will assess how companies can benefit from the investments in security technology, and discuss the possibilities of the use of monitoring technology."
1464,The architecture design for content-aware network security services,"With the ongoing increase of the network technologies' diversity and the integration of the user level applications, the legacy-style content-independent configuration of the security mechanisms cannot yields in efficient security solutions farther. Our work aims to contribute on the design of auto-reconfigurable (adaptive) security services that are capable to satisfy the application's security level required with minimal network resources' usage. In this paper we propose a new networkcentric security architecture design that relies on the current network security conditions and content-aware mechanisms. The architecture main functional blocks and the corresponding relationships are defined. This architecture shall supply three inter-domain composite user security services, named ""public traffic"", ""secret content"" and ""private communication"", as well as, attack source traceback and distributed access control functionalities."
1471,M3 based executable architecture modeling and validation,"Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) as a common integrated system architecture specification has already gained the widespread acceptance in the world. However, the limitations of its static descriptive form render it unable to support the further analysis for the dynamic behaviors of complex integrated system. Therefore, an executable model is needed to fulfill the requirement of analysis, validation and evaluation. Aimed at creating an executable model that has complete bidirectional traceability between the static representations and the dynamic properties, a four-dimension modeling approach based on Meta Model Mapping (M3) is developed to support the derivation of a Hierarchical Colored Petri Nets (HCPN) model that can reveal the logical and behavioral characteristics of the system architecture from a set of DoDAF products. The semantic corresponding relations between DoDAF state transition description and HCPN occurrence graph are also explored, which is served as the basis of the model validation. The modeling process of an Air Defense (AD) system is illustrated in detail as an application of the approach. Copyright © 2010 Binary Information Press."
1491,Computer immunodeficiency: Analogy between computer security and HIV,"Current security systems are designed to prevent foreseeable attacks. Those security systems do not prevent effectively the more emergent types of attacks, like a botnet, whose presence and behavior is difficult to predict. In order to predominate those types of attacks, we advocate an adaptive security approach based on the animal immune system. But since those sophisticated attacks can also be directed at the security systems themselves, leading to computer immunodeficiency, like HIV, in this paper we propose a protocol that protects the immune system itself. This approach discriminates between attacks on the security systems, which are part of the computer immune system, and attacks on other vital computer systems in an information infrastructure."
1494,Context-based security (and Safety) meta-policies for pervasive computing environments: The case of smart homes,"Context-based security is an approach for modeling adaptive security solutions based on the situation of use of the system. Security policies in this approach are not static as it used to be in traditional systems. The security actions to be taken are based on the knowledge of the combination of various factors such as the location of the user, the surroundings, time, temperature etc making the security policies more adaptive. The aim of this paper is to present security meta-policies based on an existing approach known as Contextual Graphs and the multilevel access model, which we presented in our previous paper. These meta-policies determine within what contexts actions in other policies should be taken - it is in this sense that we have the notion of other policies ""embedded"" within the meta-policy. Our approach can be easily used in various smart environments, even for context-aware safety meta-policies. The paper presents their use in a smart home scenario."
1502,Experimental integration of multi security policies for secure computer systems,"Resolution of integration of multi security policies plays an important role in secure-critical computer systems which support multi security policies. In this paper, a security state transition model is built by means of formal method, the different effects resulting from security-depended actions of different policies on security states is analyzed and a new approach to solve the integration and consistency of multi-policies is presented."
1520,Stabilizing Control for Cyber-Physical Systems against Energy-Constrained Deception Attacks,"Stabilizing control of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is an important yet challenging problem since system modelling may face the coexistence of multiple uncertainties including unknown disturbances, unknown bounded delays, stochastic malicious attack and stochastic mode switching in complex environment, which cause system performance to deteriorate or even be unstable. However, the above uncertainties are rarely considered simultaneously in existing study. To this end, a novel system model is proposed to reflect not only the nonlinear characteristics, external disturbances and time-varying delays, but also the randomly occurring deception attacks, which is energy-constrained and lead to the system mode switching. We aim at designing a controller such that the system achieve the prescribed Ho., disturbance rejection level. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and using the stochastic analysis techniques, the addressed controller design problem is transformed to an convex optimization problem, which can be solved by a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. An example is given to show the effectiveness of the designed controller."
