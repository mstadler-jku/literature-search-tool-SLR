23,A cloud-assisted malware detection and suppression framework for wireless multimedia system in IoT based on dynamic differential game,"As a novel dynamic network service infrastructure, Internet of Things (IoT) has gained remarkable popularity with obvious superiorities in the interoperability and real-time communication. Despite of the convenience in collecting information to provide the decision basis for the users, the vulnerability of embedded sensor nodes in multimedia devices makes the malware propagation a growing serious problem, which would harm the security of devices and their users financially and physically in wireless multimedia system (WMS). Therefore, many researches related to the malware propagation and suppression have been proposed to protect the topology and system security of wireless multimedia network. In these studies, the epidemic model is of great significance to the analysis of malware propagation. Considering the cloud and state transition of sensor nodes, a cloud-assisted model for malware detection and the dynamic differential game against malware propagation are proposed in this paper. Firstly, a SVM based malware detection model is constructed with the data sharing at the security platform in the cloud. Then the number of malware-infected nodes with physical infectivity to susceptible nodes is calculated precisely based on the attributes of WMS transmission. Then the state transition among WMS devices is defined by the modified epidemic model. Furthermore, a dynamic differential game and target cost function are successively derived for the Nash equilibrium between malware and WMS system. On this basis, a saddle-point malware detection and suppression algorithm is presented depending on the modified epidemic model and the computation of optimal strategies. Numerical results and comparisons show that the proposed algorithm can increase the utility of WMS efficiently and effectively."
76,Modeling of Intrusion and Defense for Assessment of Cyber Security at Power Substations,"Cyber intrusions to substations are critical issues to a power grid, which must be defended and mitigated. Essentially, to better understand a cyber intrusion, reconnaissance activities should be modeled. Then, strategies of cyber attacker and defender can be studied, which help to identify substations vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In this paper, a successful intrusion is regarded as a probabilistic event related to reconnaissance activities. Its probability can be approximated by the Poisson distribution of the number of vulnerabilities discovered by the attacker. Furthermore, models of intrusion and defense in competition for control of the substations are proposed using Markov decision process (MDP). Key characteristics of target substation, attacker and defender are considered for determining probabilistic state transitions related to intrusion and defense actions. Thus, by solving the MDP models, the optimal strategies (action policies) of both the attacker and defender can be obtained. With these optimal strategies, the cyber security status of a substation can be evaluated within varied time frames. The case study validates the proposed models and method, including time-based strategies of the attacker and defender."
115,Evaluating wireless network vulnerabilities and attack paths in smart grid comprehensive analysis and implementation,"Quantifying vulnerability and security levels for smart grid diversified link of networks have been a challenging task for a long period of time. Security experts and network administrators used to act based on their proficiencies and practices to mitigate network attacks rather than objective metrics and models. This paper uses the Markov Chain Model [1] to evaluate quantitatively the vulnerabilities associated to the 802.11 Wi-Fi network in a smart grid. Administrator can now assess the level of severity of potential attacks based on determining the probability density of the successive states and thus, providing the corresponding security measures. This model is based on the observed vulnerabilities provided by the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database explored by MITRE [2] to calculate the Markov processes (states) transitions probabilities and thus, deducing the vulnerability level of the entire attack paths in an attack graph. Cumulative probabilities referring to high vulnerability level in a specific attack path will lead the system administrator to apply appropriate security measures a priori to potential attacks occurrence."
140,A Blockchain-Based Authentication and Security Mechanism for IoT,"The existing identity authentication of IoT devices mostly depends on an intermediary institution, i.e., a CA server, which suffers from the single-point-failure attack. Even worse, the critical data of authenticated devices can be tampered by inner attacks without being identified. To address these issues, we utilize blockchain technology, which serves as a secure tamper-proof distributed ledger to IoT devices. In the proposed method, we assign a unique ID for each individual device and record them into the blockchain, so that they can authenticate each other without a central authority. We also design a data protection mechanism by hashing significant data (i.e. firmware) into the blockchain where any state changes of the data can be detected immediately. Finally, we implement a prototype based on an open source blockchain platform Hyperledger Fabric to verify the proposed system."
171,Contingency re-definition and its application to power system security analysis,"This paper presents the contingency re-definition and its application to power system security analysis. Contingency Analysis (CA) has been an important tool in power system planning and security analysis for many years. Based on real-time network connectivity, the re-definition function takes into account the actual response of protection subsystem on the power system equipment. It identifies the breakers required for isolating the contingency equipment. This provides additional accuracy of post contingency results and provides important data to ensure the remedial action schemes are emulated correctly. Each contingency is simulated in contingency analysis by opening these breakers to evaluate their impact to the system. The ability to recognize and respect the status of manually operated switches is important to ensure the simulation mimics protection schemes. Any non-contingency equipment forced out as a result of these breaker openings, also called sympathetic outages, will be added to the contingency equipment list. All outage equipment and breakers will be listed on the contingency definition display for each contingency case. This function has been integrated in the real-time CA, off-line CA, and into dispatcher training simulator."
183,A Novel Economical Embedded Multi-mode Intelligent Control System for Powered Wheelchair,"In order to assist different kinds of disabled persons and senior citizens, to lower the cost and improve the effectiveness and convenience of human-machine interaction, a novel economical embedded multi-mode intelligent control system for powered wheelchair is developed. The system is based on a high-performance 16-bit compact single chip system. It has “Manual”, “Speech”, “Vision”, and “Autonomous” four modes that are fulfilled by four modules. The mode and the corresponding module can be customized according to the needs of different users and situations and that makes a further lower cost. In addition, fusion of multi-mode and other security measures are discussed. The hardware, software, control mechanism, and some experimental results are elaborated in the paper."
190,System-Aware Cyber Security,"In this paper we outline the need for a new systems engineering architecturally focused approach for addressing the growing threats of debilitating cyber attacks: System-Aware Security. This novel security architecture resides at the application layer and is based on smart reusable system security services. We layout an initial vision for this architectural formulation and show how it can potentially enhance the security of systems by complementing the traditional perimeter security model. In addition, we outline an ongoing research activity involving the development of an initial application for a specific System-Aware Security architecture embedded in a command and control system. The architecture includes three interactive situational adapting smart reusable security services: data continuity checking, configuration hopping, and honeypots. Finally, we describe how these services could be converted into reusable design patterns to stimulate reuse in additional systems."
196,Adaptive security-aware scheduling using multi-agent system,"Internet protocol security (IPsec) provides real-time IP packets with confidentiality security service, making them robust against snooping security threats. Conventionally, the security level provided by such protocol cannot be modified according to the status of the network. In this paper, we propose a security-aware scheduling algorithm for a heterogeneous packet switched network. It provides real-time packet flows with guaranteed quality of service (QoS) while adaptively controls the packet's confidentiality security service level. The proposed scheme is modeled using the object-oriented multi-agent methodology. By applying a buffer estimation technique at the network's end nodes, the algorithm provides a real-time network congestion control hence satisfying the network performance metrics. In order to minimize the overhead of network association performed by the IPsec, the algorithm overloads the priority code point fields of the IEEE 802.1Q tagged frame format. This approach helps meet both QoS and security requirements for real-time data flows."
199,Keynote: Topology Aware Adaptive Security,"Summary form only given. Cyber-Physical Systems can be harmed through both cyber-enabled or physically-enabled attacks, particularly ones that exploit the often ignored interplay between the cyber and physical spaces characterizing a system operating environment. Awareness of the topology of the operating environment of systems as well as its dynamics can support adaptive security more effectively. In this talk I propose the use of Bigraphical Reactive Systems to represent the topology of cyber and physical spaces. I describe how to use this representation to reason about the consequences of the evolution of topological configurations on the satisfaction of security requirements. I also illustrate a planning technique to identify an adaptation strategy to be used at runtime, to circumvent, prevent, or mitigate security requirements violations previously identified. Finally I will describe how this approach has been integrated into an existing commercial access control software."
202,On the role of primary and secondary assets in adaptive security: An application in smart grids,"Adaptive security aims to protect valuable assets managed by a system, by applying a varying set of security controls. Engineering adaptive security is not an easy task. A set of effective security countermeasures should be identified. These countermeasures should not only be applied to (primary) assets that customers desire to protect, but also to other (secondary) assets that can be exploited by attackers to harm the primary assets. Another challenge arises when assets vary dynamically at runtime. To accommodate these variabilities, it is necessary to monitor changes in assets, and apply the most appropriate countermeasures at runtime. The paper provides three main contributions for engineering adaptive security. First, it proposes a modeling notation to represent primary and secondary assets, along with their variability. Second, it describes how to use the extended models in engineering security requirements and designing required monitoring functions. Third, the paper illustrates our approach through a set of adaptive security scenarios in the customer domain of a smart grid. We suggest that modeling secondary assets aids the deployment of countermeasures, and, in combination with a representation of assets variability, facilitates the design of monitoring functions."
219,Bio-Inspired Enterprise Security,"Providing security for enterprises is difficult due to the size and complexity of their computing and networking infrastructures. These environments consist of a large number of diverse systems and services that continually change, thus they are difficult to defend using current static-oriented defense mechanisms. This paper introduces a new security paradigm that mimics designs in nature to ensure the safety and soundness of infrastructures that are potentially very diverse and dynamic. Primary inspiration has come from ant colonies, social networking, and bioinformatics. The proposed framework combines these ideas to provide complex-adaptive security for computer systems, telecommunications, and critical Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) infrastructures."
235,Energy-aware adaptive security management for wireless sensor networks,"We present a work in progress of an adaptive security management scheme for wireless sensor networks. The unique characteristics of these networks place great demands on their design and operation in terms of resource and security management. Resource and security adaptability achieved through self- and context-awareness will take the feasibility of the networks to a new level. The scheme has self- and context-awareness in addition to a holistic view of security services at each layer of the communication stack. It uses distributed agents and intrusion detection systems to monitor the security threats and then dynamically adapts its security level by jointly considering several dimensions. This translates into optimal security-energy under a given resource and context. The key dimensions are energy budget, computing power and memory size of nodes, location-based security threat levels, data coherence, and data lifetime. Trust management is used to test the integrity of untrusted nodes which further assist the adaptation decision."
245,Security in Underwater Sensor Network,"Underwater wireless sensor network is a novel type of underwater networked system. Due to the characteristics of UWSN and underwater channel, UWSN are vulnerable to malicious attacks. The existing security solutions proposed for WSN cannot be used directly in UWSN. Moreover, most of these solutions are layer wise. In this paper, we studied the threat, attack, and security issues of UWSN. Subsequently, we argue that layered security schemes cannot protect UWSN against blended attacks. Additionally, we presented a novel preliminary conceive, which is a cross-layer, adaptive, selective security scheme."
262,Towards cognitive security systems,"This talk addresses the changing world of security systems, and a possible approach to their improvement. Since the scientific, technical, industrial, business, and social worlds have changed from physically isolated systems to electronically interconnected system-of-systems (SoS), the functioning of such a SoS depends critically on its operational robustness and security. In the previous physically-isolated world, robust static security for selected matched problems was often sufficient. Today, we need a new approach to providing security, because even adaptive security is insufficient. This new approach is termed here a cognitive security system. The talk will cover three major issues. First, the talk starts from a review of the existing security systems, with their problems and required solutions, as well as their vulnerabilities, attacks, and defences. Second, it provides a review of decision-making systems, including dynamic and dynamical systems, complex systems, adaptive systems, autonomic systems and their attributes, symbiotic systems, and finally special attention is given to cognitive dynamic systems as defined by Wang's cognitive informatics [1-4], Kinsner cognitive machines, [5], Haikonen conscious machines [6], and Haykin cognitive dynamic systems [7]. This review ends with a model of cognitive security system. This model has a feature based on polyscale analysis and synthesis never reported before. Finally, examples of security-related cognitive static and dynamic systems developed in our research group are presented, including wavelet-packet fingerprint compression for data mining, watermarking and steganography, a new chaotic cryptography system, and new polyscale analysis for SmartGrid2."
278,Real-Time Scheduling with Security Enhancement for Packet Switched Networks,"Real-time network applications depend on schedulers to guarantee the quality of service (QoS). Conventional real-time schedulers focus on the timing constraints but are much less effective in satisfying the security requirements. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security-aware scheduling system for packet switched networks using a real-time multi-agent design model. The proposed system combines real-time scheduling with security service enhancement. The scheduling unit uses the differentiated-earliest-deadline-first (Diff-EDF) scheduler and the security enhancement scheme adopts a congestion control mechanism. The required QoS is guaranteed for different types (audio and video) of real-time data flows, while the packet security levels are adaptively enhanced according to the feedbacks from the congestion control module. Compared with the IPsec protocol, the proposed scheme reduces the number of pending packets at the destinations. In implementation, the proposed scheme can overload the priority code point and the virtual-LAN identifier fields of the IEEE 802.1Q frame format, hence eliminating the overhead of the security associations performed by the IPsec protocol."
290,Integrated aviation security for defense-in-depth of next generation air transportation system,"To meet the significant increase in civil air traffic demand in the National Airspace System (NAS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is cooperating with other departments to develop Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen). NextGen will greatly increase the NAS capacity, efficiency, safety, flexibility, and environmental protection. Aviation Security is one of the core components in NextGen. Without security protection, all NextGen functions will be vulnerable to various attacks and cannot work robustly. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Aviation Security (IAS) framework for defense-in-depth of various aspects of NextGen security such as cyber security and aircraft anti-hijacking. IAS uses a multi-layered, cross-component, and multi-planed (data plane and control plane) structure. Multiple components in NextGen such as communication, navigation, surveillance, air traffic management, aircraft anti-hijacking, access control, biometrics, risk analysis and management, etc, are processed integratedly through information fusion to enhance the security performance of each module. We will present a detailed implementation approach of IAS including the AlertEnterprise based Integrated Risk Management (IRM) Model, defense-in-depth of communication, navigation, surveillance, and aircraft anti-hijacking. Compared with disparate systems, the proposed IAS has much higher security performance to be effective against both outsider and insider threats."
309,A probabilistic approach to dynamic power system security,"The problem of dynamic power system security is investigated. A probabilistic approach is chosen, and an appropriate power system model is developed for analyzing the dynamic behavior of the different operational modes of the system. The model includes the transients induced by primary and secondary disturbance events. They are modeled by switches in the model whose states depend on the instantaneous values of certain system variables. The model characterizes the interaction between the dynamic state of the system and the network topology as defined by the status of the various protective relays in the system. A dynamic security region is defined as a subset of the state-structure space of the power system such that at any moment in time an operating point within the region satisfies all the constraints required for secure power system operation. The probabilistic evolution of the state and structure is computed as the solution of a system of linear partial differential equations with matching conditions at the switching boundaries. A dynamic security measure is defined as the integral of the joint probability density of the state and structure of the system over the dynamic security region for all possible structural variations. This computation yields the probability that the power system remains secure for the range of primary events considered. Computer simulations for an example power system illustrate the utility of the approach.<>"
313,Research on the innovation of liaoning public safety and security emergency management system from the perspective of smart city,"This paper studies innovating Liaoning's Public Safety and Security emergency management system, and improving Liaoning' s emergency management capabilities comprehensively in five major aspects, namely the upgrading of philosophy, the management coordination, the application of technology, the linkage on links, and the guarantee of resources, with the aid of a new generation of information technology tools such as the Internet of Things and cloud computing, and with the help of the operational mode of full perception, deep integration and intelligent collaboration."
328,Risk assessment of cascading failure in power systems based on uncertainty theory,"Traditional risk assessment methods adopt the long-term failure model of element and severity indices to characterize the failure probability and its impact on the power system respectively. However, in the actual system, the failure probability has time-varying characteristic due to the influence of the internal system and the external environment. Severity indices are formed by weighting each severity in the system, and weight coefficients are selected based on different focus, with subjective and hypothetical premises. A new assessment method which uses the credibility measure to establish the probability of component failure and global fuzzy security index to measure the severity of the accident is proposed. N-1 contingencies are chosen as initiating event of cascading failure and risk ranking. The results of risk ranking of N-1 contingency analysis is regarded as initiating event of the next simulation layer to obtain collapse sequences. As a case study, RSTS six-bus system is simulated. The obtained results have shown that the proposed method is more accordant to actual power system operating states and it is with better rationality and validity."
361,Design of a novel bridge-type FCL and its application in UPFC,"Aiming at the problem of short-circuit protection, a novel bridge-type topology of fault current limiting (FCL) is established based on resonant characteristics. It is equivalent to a piece of wire during the normal operating state. When short-circuit fault occurs, the dc limiting reactor inserts automatically and rapidly under the joint action of the capacitor, limiting the increasing speed and amplitude of fault current, therefore protects the security of the equipment. Compared with the original topologies, the novel topology proposed reduces the number of controllable devices, simplifies the control system, and reduces the design value and size of the dc limiting reactor, which makes it has the advantages of high reliability, low cost, and minimum maintenance requirements. The structure and working principle of the FCL proposed are elaborated in detail. Meanwhile, a topology of its application in unified power flow controller (UPFC) is proposed to verify its function. Simulations prove the feasibility of the new FCL."
362,Towards an FPGA Implementation of IOT-Based Multi-Modal Hearing AID System,"This paper presents implementing a cloud-based multimodal hearing aid (HA) system. It identifies major processing blocks to be implemented on an embedded Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and focuses on aspects of a custom block that deals with the integration of multiple input sources of the HA. In particular, the integration block deals with the combination of audio and video (AV) data at different sampling rates, with each having a different number of bits to encode their information. It realizes seamless combination of AV data by assigning a scaled number of bits to each component in the combined signal to achieve a real-time data transmission of all data sources. In addition, key issues such as security is discussed and plan to address this in our future work is stated."
374,Integrating Multi-Modal Circuit Features within an Efficient Encryption System,"The problem of the incorporation of pattern features with unusual distributions is well known within pattern recognition systems even if not easily addressed. The problem is more acute when features are derived from characteristics of given integrated electronic circuits. The current paper introduces novel efficient techniques for normalising sets of features which are highly multi-modal in nature, so as to allow them to be incorporated within a single encryption key generation system based primarily on measured hardware characteristics. The utility of the proposed system lies in the observation that the need for data sent to and from remote network nodes to be secure and verified is substantial. Security can be improved by using encryption techniques based on keys, which are based on unique properties of the individual nodes within the network. This will serve both to minimize the need for key storage and sharing as well as to validate the initiator node of a message."
397,Decision support system for substation operation,"The authors describe a prototype for a hybrid expert system developed to provide advice to station operators in real time. The domain of this expert system is transmission planning as applied to real-time operation. It consists of symbolic and procedural modules that address a variety of electrical concerns at generating stations, including breaker thermal duties, breaker fault duties, and voltage-critical load buses. Once the system is invoked, the prevailing operating state is evaluated for static security-limit violations. If any violations are encouraged, the system searches its knowledge base for plausible plans to alleviate the problem.<>"
401,Adaptive Scaling for Image Sensors in Embedded Security Applications,"Image sensors are widely used for multiple applications today. The security applications imply not only data acquisition, transmission, and display, but also embedded or in-the-cloud image processing algorithms as motion or intruder detection. In this paper, we analyze the impact of image scaling on the image processing algorithms, with focus on object detection. Different methods for image scaling are presented and their impact on the algorithms are measured. We propose an adaptive scaling mechanism, that implies the selection and dynamic adaptive configuration of one of the available hardware engines (interpolators), in order to optimize the power consumption and the bandwidth used for data transmission. The artificial intelligence processing outputs are used as a source for these configuration changes. Besides the optimal decision on enabling the appropriate re-sampling interpolator, the parameters computed (in order to configure this selected hardware block) are the quality of the scaling and the image resolution. The hardware implementation for this mechanism is presented and the measured results are discussed. The conclusion we drew is that an adaptive scaling mechanism in embedded security applications significantly improved the object detection algorithms and optimized the used data transfer bandwidth."
404,Combined and Robust SNOW-ZUC Algorithm Based on Chaotic System,"SNOW-3G and ZUC are two stream ciphers standardized by the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) organization to ensure the LTE (Long Term Evolution of radio networks) security. Unfortunately, these algorithms present some weaknesses. The main objective of this study is to design and implement an enhanced algorithm combining the functionalities of standard SNOW-3G and ZUC algorithms in order to provide security to the LTE network. A chaotic generator has been used to increase the randomness and robustness of generated key-streams. The proposed architecture was implemented on Xilinx virtex-S FPGA technology and its security was evaluated using many security tests (generated key-stream distribution, key sensitivity, key space, and NIST statistical tests). The experimental results show that the proposed design allows to encrypt data in two operating modes (SNOW-3G and ZUC modes) using limited hardware resources and power consumption while ensuring more resistance against cryptanalysis attacks."
453,Attack Detection based on Alternating Direction Multiplier Method for Distributed State Estimation in Smart Grid,"Accurate state estimation is critical for smart grid monitoring. Due to the high degree of integration of cyber-physical systems, cyber attacks against various types of measurement data in smart grids are becoming more popular. As a result, the state estimation results for smart grid will be inaccurate, affecting the precise analysis and control of the smart grid’s current operating state. This paper proposes an ADMM-based distributed state estimate approach and a Markov attack detection mechanism to address the constraints of traditional state estimate and location of cyber-attacks. First, through separating power grid into many regions, we propose a distributed alternate direction state estimation approach based on multipliers that reduces the power system’s communication and computational expense. Second, by adopting presented combination attack model of false data injection attack and DoS attack, a Markov attack detecting mechanism based on distributed state estimate is developed. Finally, experimental results on the IEEE Bus-118 system demonstrate that our model has better efficiency and accuracy of suggested distributed state estimation and attack detection methods."
478,WSN-based solutions for security and surveillance,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are composed of autonomous sensor nodes that cooperate among themselves to monitor scenarios in environmental, industrial, civilian and military applications. The wide applicability of such systems stimulates the growth of intelligent services to make living environments more comfortable and safer. Concerning security and surveillance issues, WSNs have been widely integrated with multi-modal sensors and actuators in order to actively detect any abnormal events. Though the sensor fusion provides accuracy and robustness, problems such as high costs and consumptions exist. In order to reduce the hardware complexity, other systems for detection and tracking of human activities interact with active devices worn by the targets. In this work, a WSN-based solution is proposed for the detection of transceiver-free targets exploiting only the information provided by the wireless links among the nodes."
516,A Novel Model of Mimic Defense Based on Minimal L-Order Error Probability,"Mimic defense is an active defense theory, which aims to fundamentally change the “easy to attack and difficult to defend” situation of network security. In this paper, we propose an evaluation method based on the probability of being attack successfully, and improve the evaluation scheme of historical confidence. We combine the two evaluation schemes with the TOPSIS (technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution) algorithm, and finally form a complete heterogeneous variant dynamic scheduling model. Different from traditional multi-mode voting algorithms, the effect of the heterogeneous degree in voting is considered, and we use Bayesian estimation to obtain the optimal result in the probabilistic sense. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively enhance the dynamic and security of the mimic defense model, and give full play to the characteristics of mimic defense."
517,Prediction of critical infrastructures safety,"The semi-Markov models is used to describe the complex systems operation processes. This model allows to tie the results of investigations of critical infrastructures inside-dependences together with the results concerned with critical infrastructures outside-dependencies. Linking of the inside and outside complex systems dependencies, under the assumed their structures multi-state models, is the main idea of the presented in the paper critical infrastructures safety analysis methodology. The proposed safety methodology is applied to safety modeling and prediction of a computational example."
523,Risks in smart environments and adaptive access controls,"In monitored environments, where risks can be prevented via sensors and spatial data technologies, security rules, in particular access control rules, should be made adaptive to the situation at hand at run time. The paper presents adaptive access controls suitable for “smart environments”, based on the Attribute-based Access Control paradigm. Risks are notified by monitoring devices and managed by a Risk Management System, which is illustrated. To adapt the access control decisions to risk mitigation needs, security policies are defined to dynamically activate or deactivate access rules according to the operations required to manage the risks."
526,Islanding detection of distributed generation in presence of fault events,"The investiture in Distributed Generations (DGs) technologies have begun to monopolies transmission system's architecture instantaneously after announcing its liberation and deregulation of the energy market to the public. Such movement has propelled vicious competitions among power generation companies to initiate superior innovations in meeting consumers' needs, administering high power quality yet economical. With the integration of DG technologies, power grid operations have dynamically benefited from such commendable services which apprehend power failures from transpiring; securing power quality, accommodating capricious demand curve, fault compensatory applications and other auxiliary services. Subsequently, the presence of DGs have revolutionised power grid management to conceive off-grid and self-sustaining criterion where microgrid/islanding topology adaptations are commonly affiliated. However, employing islanding-mode proposition, potential exposure to unplanned islanded paradox due to ineffectual detection control scheme is tenable. Prolonged accidental islanding-mode operation can afflict undesirable annihilation of utility's resources and deemed economically unprofitable which results in compromising safety and serviceability. Thus, this paper demonstrates contrasting dynamics in adopting either passive or active islanding detection approaches based on selected algorithms; Over/Under Voltage and Frequency detection (Passive) or Active Frequency Drift and Sandia Frequency Shift detection (Active). Comparisons of the proposed methodologies are presented using MATLAB/Simulink to view superiority and applicability in determining the status of the grid's operating mode."
532,A Unification of Computer and Network Security Concepts,"Network security issues can be handled with the same concepts that apply to single computer systems. The network operating modes of Dedicated, System High and Multilevel establish the requirements for a network Reference Monitor function. It, is shown that the Reference Monitor function can be implemented in a variety of ways."
536,"Fail-Safe, Fail-Secure Experiments for Small UAS and UAM Traffic in Urban Airspace","Millions of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS), or drones weighing less than 55 pounds, will fly in urban airspaces within a decade. This is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation (GA). Robust and resilient detection, identification, localization, and tracking of sUAS sharing UAM airspace is complicated by urban factors such as non-transmitting, non-cooperative drones. Exacerbating these challenges, current technological limitations and vulnerabilities in Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can pose safety and security threats. To streamline a vision of safe and secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace, we propose Drone Net, a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) network of multi-modal ground and flight instruments. Drone Net is an architecture fusing a network of passive visual and acoustic sensor nodes with active Radio Detection and Ranging (radar) and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensing methods for UTM, designed for integration with existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and future UAM systems. The purpose of the Drone Net system is to evaluate use of Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic arrays networked within an urban UAS operating region such as uncontrolled Class-G and waiver-granted Class-D airspace. The Drone Net approach combines detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADS-B, and EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe, fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network. Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS that are both compliant and non-compliant alongside GA and UAM more safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more advanced scenarios between multiple UAS. The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time for analysis and security applications. More concrete applications for Drone Net include UTM integration with ATC and UAM, but also airspace safety and security for campus and public venues in general. Herein, we will present our experimental design and current test data from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in collaboration with University of Colorado Boulder toward completing the open specification for ground and flight instruments. We would additionally like to invite others to participate in growing the network and the data available for UTM, UAM, and GA shared airspace research."
551,Studying Advanced Firewalls,"A Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) is a security device that combines a firewall, an antivirus, an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and VPN functionalities. This chapter focuses on ASA models, modes of using ASA equipment, and an overview of ASA 5505. It discusses the types of ASA licenses, and configuring of the interfaces, DHCP service, ACLs, network address translation (NAT) service, and AAA. The chapter also discusses the configuring of Cisco devices using the Cisco Configuration Professional and Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) graphic tools. There are different models of ASAs. All the models offer advanced firewall and VPN functionalities. The biggest difference between the models is the maximal flow of traffic that can be managed by each model and the number and the types of interfaces. An ASA model is chosen based on the requirements of an organization such as the flow, maximal connections per second and the company's budget."
569,A discounted stochastic game approach to intrusion detection in wireless ad hoc networks,A non-cooperative non-zero-sum discounted stochastic game framework is considered in order to methodically formulate the intrusion detection problem in wireless ad hoc networks. Underlying game parameters and player objective functions are defined to characterize the security requirements of a wide range of wireless ad hoc network applications. The validity and effectiveness of the developed framework are verified by generating numerical instances of the game model and analyzing the equilibrium results. The game outcomes show that the proposed framework provides useful insights on: (1) the expected behavior of rational intruders; and (2) optimal strategies of the intrusion detection system to allocate its security resources in different operational modes of the network.
573,Smartcards and Secure Elements,"This chapter presents key technologies related to smartcards and secure elements (SEs), especially as they relate to the wireless systems. It outlines the available and future alternatives for traditional and enhanced variants of smartcards. Smartcards represent a type of SE hardware. Examples of solutions for providing SEs are the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM), Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), eSE, and external micro Secure Digital (SD) cards. Smartcards can be categorized by their physical characteristics such as contact and contactless variants, and by their functionality such as memory cards, Central Processing Unit (CPU) or Multi Processing Unit (MPU) cards with embedded OS, multi‐mode communications cards and hybrid cards. Smartcards can be divided into sub‐categories to distinguish between contact cards, contactless cards and multi‐component cards. The UICC communications are based on secure channels which ensure the secure communication between the smartcard and external world."
589,Towards Run-Time Verification of Adaptive Security for IoT in EHealth,"This paper integrates run-time verification enablers in the feedback adaptation loop of the ASSET adaptive security framework for Internet of Things (IoT) in the eHealth settings and instantiates the resulting framework with Colored Petri Nets. The run-time enablers make machine-readable formal models of a system state and context available at run-time. In addition, they make requirements that define the objectives of verification available at run-time as formal specifications and enable dynamic context monitoring and adaptation. Run-time adaptive behavior that deviates from the normal mode of operation of the system represents a major threat to the sustainability of critical eHealth services. Therefore, the integration of run-time enablers into the ASSET adaptive framework could lead to a sustainable security framework for IoT in eHealth."
597,SecuriTAS: A Tool for Engineering Adaptive Security,"This paper presents SecuriTAS, a tool to engineer adaptive security. It allows software designers to model security concerns together with the requirements of a system. This model is then used at runtime to analyze changes in security concerns and select the best set of security controls necessary to protect the system."
598,Energy-Aware Design of Secure Multi-Mode Real-Time Embedded Systems with FPGA Co-Processors,"We approach the emerging area of energy efficient, secure real-time embedded systems design. Many modern embedded systems have to fulfill strict security constraints and are often required to meet stringent deadlines in different operation modes, where the number and nature of active tasks vary (dynamic task sets). In this context, the use of dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS) techniques and onboard field-programmable gate array (FPGA) co-processors offer new dimensions for energy savings and performance enhancement. We propose a novel design framework that provides the best security protection consuming the minimal energy for all operation modes of a system. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our techniques."
601,Safe and Automatic Live Update for Operating Systems,"Increasingly many systems have to run all the time with no downtime allowed. Consider, for example, systems controlling electric power plants and e-banking servers. Nevertheless, security patches and a constant stream of new operating system versions need to be deployed without stopping running programs. These factors naturally lead to a pressing demand for live update---upgrading all or parts of the operating system without rebooting. Unfortunately, existing solutions require significant manual intervention and thus work reliably only for small operating system patches.In this paper, we describe an automated system for live update that can safely and automatically handle major upgrades without rebooting. We have implemented our ideas in Proteos, a new research OS designed with live update in mind. Proteos relies on system support and nonintrusive instrumentation to handle even very complex updates with minimal manual effort. The key novelty is the idea of state quiescence, which allows updates to happen only in safe and predictable system states. A second novelty is the ability to automatically perform transactional live updates at the process level, ensuring a safe and stable update process. Unlike prior solutions, Proteos supports automated state transfer, state checking, and hot rollback. We have evaluated Proteos on 50 real updates and on novel live update scenarios. The results show that our techniques can effectively support both simple and complex updates, while outperforming prior solutions in terms of flexibility, security, reliability, and stability of the update process."
621,Sharing Databases on the Web with Porter Proxy,"With large number of datasets now available through the Web, data-sharing ecosystems such as the Web Observatory have emerged. The Web Observatory provides an active decentralised ecosystem for datasets and applications based on a number Web Observatory sites, each of which can run in a different administrative domain. On a Web Observatory site users can publish and securely access datasets across domains via a harmonised API and reverse proxies for access control. However, that API provides a different interface to that of the databases on which datasets are stored and, consequently, existing applications that consume data from specific databases require major modification to be added to the Web Observatory ecosystem. In this paper we propose a lightweight architecture called Porter Proxy to address this concern. Porter Proxy exposes the same interfaces as databases as requested by the users while enforcing access control. Characteristics of the proposed Porter Proxy architecture are evaluated based on adversarial scenario-handling in Web Observatory eco-system."
641,Autonomic Management for Convergent Networks to Support Robustness of Appliance Technologies,"Autonomic management within autonomic computing framework is considered as the future and viable solution for many appliances, either in software or hardware. Nevertheless, its current research application in computer networks is mainly visible in the intra domain space, and less attention is given to inter domain between one core network and another. This paper reviews some of the work on autonomic management and presents a framework that can be extended to a global and universal solution, such as fulfilling demand on bandwidth management, Quality of Service (QOS), and Service Level Agreements (SLA). The autonomic computing self- features are considered to show the viability of the proposed framework."
647,Concurrent Programming vs. Concurrency Control: Shared Events or Shared Data,"Two views of concurrency in an object system exist. Those pursuing concurrent programming believe that activities in the real world are inherently concurrent and therefore objects are themselves active. Objects engage in shared events by sending and receiving messages. Communicating Sequential Processes [Hoar85a] and Actors [Agha86a] embrace this view. On the other hand, those pursuing models of concurrency control believe that objects are data and that concurrent access to data needs to be controlled by the system according to some correctness notion. Database transactions, atomic objects [Weih84a, Schw84a] and nested objects [Mart88a] embrace this view.Concurrent programming, in our view, places a significant burden on programming. Correct concurrent behavior is specified as combinations of interactions within a potentially large set of concurrent objects. A programmer must verify that the implementations of all the objects never produce undesirable interactions. Correctness of concurrent behavior is left to the programmer.We are pursuing models embracing concurrency control primarily because a programmer is not required to consider concurrency. The operations on an object can be specified in terms of preconditions and postconditions and traditional program verification techniques can be used to verify an operation's implementation. A programmer only considers the serial behavior of an object in isolation; he need not concern himself with how other concurrent activities might affect the object. Correctness of interleavings is left to the system.Serializability is the usual correctness notion for concurrency control algorithms. In transaction terminology, each competing transaction executes a sequence of basic actions. Any interleaving of the actions is correct if it is equivalent to some serial execution of the transaction. Serializability allows a transaction to be programmed in isolation, that is without considering possible interleavings with other transactions. The system may indeed interleave the actions of several transactions but it is up to the system to make the interleaving appear serial.Concurrent programming is apparently more general. A programmer can implement anything, including undesirable interactions like deadlock. The price for this generality is that the programmer must reason about global orderings of events and thus correctness is difficult to show.The traditional transaction model is not general enough for programming shared object systems. For example, several researchers, [Bern87a, Garc87a, Pu88a], have recognized that transactions are too restrictive for long-lived activities. The problem is that the transaction model is too conservative. Only reading and writing a data item at a single layer of abstraction is modeled. Once a read-write, write-read or write-write dependency is established between two transactions, it remains for the life of the transaction and limits further interleavings.Our approach is to discover and explore less restrictive correctness notions that still allow programmers to implement operations on objects in isolation. In [Mart88a] we present two such correctness notions: externally serializable computations and semantically verifiable nonserializable computations. Both correctness notions assume the nested object model. In [Mart87a] we give a nested object solution to the Dining Philosophers' Problem [Dijk71a]. Nested objects incorporate both the semantics of an object and the data abstraction hierarchy of an object.Nested objects form a nested object system. A nested object system is hierarchical; objects exist at different levels of the system. The execution of an operation on an object at level i results in the execution of operations on objects at level i-1. However, only top level objects are viewed externally.A computation at level i is a description of the state change made to level i objects and the return values produced by executing a partially ordered set of operations on level i objects. The computations at each level together form an n-level system computation.Externally serializable computations are n-level system computations in which the top level objects are left in states that could be produced by serial computations. However, lower level objects may be left in states that no serial computation could produce. Because both data abstraction hierarchies and operations semantics are considered in the nested object model, dependencies established between concurrent computations can be systematically ignored. Long-lived computations can execute efficiently if dependencies can later be ignored.Nested objects are more general than other models of concurrency control. Transactions are two-level nested objects that read and write basic data items. Atomic objects are two-level nested objects that perform abstract operations.The 1988 Object Based Concurrent Programming Workshop did not directly address the differences between concurrent programming and concurrency control. Perhaps future workshops can contrast the generality, the applicability, the programmability, the security and the performance implications of models from both concurrent programming and concurrency control."
649,Reinforced practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol for cyber physical systems,"Cyber–physical systems (CPS) are becoming an essential component of modern life. CPS services enable information to be exchanged between physical devices and virtual systems. The increasing malicious activities causing confidential data leakage and incorrect performance of devices are posing challenges for protection against cyber threats. Therefore, development of effective solutions that can protect both CPS data and data exchange networks are extremely urgent. This study makes some improvements on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and provides a critical analysis of the feasibility of using blockchain technology to protect constrained CPS data. It also justifies the choice of the improved PBFT for implementation on such devices and simulates the main distributed ledger scenarios. The improved PBFT works as follows: first, the client broadcasts the signed transaction data to the entire network, rather than just the master node, followed by a hash value comparison verification process; second, select the master node based on the longest chain principle, and punish the malicious node via the “blacklist” mechanism; third, add the data synchronization and verification process, as well as dynamically entering and leaving nodes via state transitions. Ultimately, the PBFT commit phase is eliminated, resulting in a two-stage process. In comparison to the original PBFT protocol, the Reinforced Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (RPBFT) protocol may substantially enhance system throughput and minimize consensus communication time, thereby improving overall system efficiency while guaranteeing security. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."
689,Detection and robustness evaluation of android malware classifiers,"Android malware attacks are tremendously increasing, and evasion techniques become more and more effective. For this reason, it is necessary to continuously improve the detection performances. With this paper, we wish to pursue this purpose with two contributions. On one hand, we aim at evaluating how improving machine learning-based malware detectors, and on the other hand, we investigate to which extent adversarial attacks can deteriorate the performances of the classifiers. Analysis of malware samples is performed using static and dynamic analysis. This paper proposes a framework for integrating both static and dynamic features trained on machine learning methods and deep neural network. On employing machine learning algorithms, we obtain an accuracy of 97.59% with static features using SVM, and 95.64% is reached with dynamic features using Random forest. Additionally, a 100% accuracy was obtained with CART and SVM using hybrid attributes (on combining relevant static and dynamic features). Further, using deep neural network models, experimental results showed an accuracy of 99.28% using static features, 94.61% using dynamic attributes, and 99.59% by combining both static and dynamic features (also known as multi-modal attributes). Besides, we evaluated the robustness of classifiers against evasion and poisoning attack. In particular comprehensive analysis was performed using permission, APIs, app components and system calls (especially n-grams of system calls). We noticed that the performances of the classifiers significantly dropped while simulating evasion attack using static features, and in some cases 100% of adversarial examples were wrongly labelled by the classification models. Additionally, we show that models trained using dynamic features are also vulnerable to attack, however they exhibit more resilience than a classifier built on static features. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature."
693,A Hybrid Dynamic Risk Analysis Methodology for Cyber-Physical Systems,"Recent technological advances allow us to design and implement sophisticated infrastructures to assist users’ everyday life; technological paradigms such as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Multi-modal Transport are excellent instances of those cases. Therefore, a systematic risk evaluation process in conjunction with proper threat identification are essential for environments like those mentioned above as they involve human safety. Threat modelling is the process of identifying and understanding threats while risk analysis is the process of identifying and analyzing potential risks. This research initially focuses on the most widely-used threat modelling and risk analysis approaches and reviewing their characteristics. Then, it presents a service-oriented dynamic risk analysis approach that focuses on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) by adopting threat modelling characteristics and by blending other methods and well-established sources to achieve automation in several stages. Finally, it provides the qualitative features of the proposed method and other related threat modelling and risk analysis approaches with a discussion regarding their similarities, differences, advantages and drawbacks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
716,Self-adaptive and secure mechanism for IoT based multimedia services: a survey,"With the advent of internet of things (IoT) and IoT multimedia services in real-time applications, including smart healthcare, smart home, and smart connected transportation, IoT multimedia systems have significantly enhanced the lifestyle. However, the increased number of connected heterogeneous IoT multimedia devices have resulted in several vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. The existing multimedia in IoT multimedia security solutions are insufficient for detecting such complex attacks and require a self-adaptive security mechanism that can monitor the changing environment and detect, mitigate, plan, and prevent future prospective attacks in real time. In this study, we conduct a study of several self-adaptive security approaches for IoT multimedia and analyze them based on critical, security metrics to determine their level of support and the achieved satisfaction for IoT multimedia services. The evaluation results show significant insights, challenges, and concerns in the existing approaches, which can provide vital information for the development of future IoT multimedia security research. We propose a self-adaptive security model for IoT multimedia and discuss a case utilizing a mobile e-health system, where we use an adaptation model (using monitor-analyze-plan-execute over a shared knowledge adaptation loop) to determine the adaptation requirement based on the confidence level of several security factors. The adaptation requirement depicts that adaptation is required for stabilizing the security factors in a continuous context-changing sustainable e-health IoT multimedia environment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature."
725,Adaptive security control of time-varying constraints nonlinear cyber-physical systems with false data injection attacks,"In this article, an adaptive security control scheme is presented for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) suffering from false data injection (FDI) attacks and time-varying state constraints. Firstly, an adaptive bound estimation mechanism is introduced in the backstepping control design to mitigate the effect of FDI attacks. Secondly, to solve the unknown sign time-varying state-feedback gains aroused by the FDI attacks, a type of Nussbaum function is employed in the adaptive security control. Then, by constructing a barrier Lyapunov function, it can be ensured that all signals of controlled system are bounded and the time-varying state constraints are not transgressed. Finally, the provided simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. © 2022 Northeastern University, China."
736,Monitoring Cyber-Physical Systems Using a Tiny Twin to Prevent Cyber-Attacks,"We propose a method to detect attacks on sensors and controllers in cyber-physical systems. We develop a monitor that uses an abstract digital twin, Tiny Twin, to detect false sensor data and faulty control commands. The Tiny Twin is a state transition system that represents the observable behavior of the system from the monitor point of view. At runtime, the monitor observes the sensor data and the control commands, and checks whether the observed data and commands are consistent with the state transitions in the Tiny Twin. The monitor produces an alarm when an inconsistency is detected. We model the components of the system and the physical processes in the Rebeca modeling language and use its model checker to generate the state space. The Tiny Twin is built automatically by reducing the state space, keeping the observable behavior of the system, and preserving the trace equivalence. We demonstrate the method and evaluate it in detecting attacks using a temperature control system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
749,Security Challenges in 5G and IoT Networks: A Review,"5G networks are poised to satisfy the anticipated growth in Internet of Technology (IoT) devices and their related systems. The invasion of 5G networks brings along with it an accelerated need for security and privacy. The need for tailor-made security solutions has become the need of the hour to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and authentication in 5G-based IoT networks. Since IoT initiates sensors and actuators in a totally smart environment, IoT security will involve protecting the total deployment architecture of IoT from internal and external attacks. Integration of cryptographical algorithms and quantum cryptography has been used effectively to secure data in 5G networks. Privacy and identity management has been a mandatory requirement in networks carrying delicate data involved in retail shops, traffic services, and health monitoring systems. Securing data in 5G and IoT networks and detection of trustworthy and rogue nodes, proper monitoring, logging, and broadcasting are the vital necessities of any security system. The exhaustive survey on the security issues in the 5G-IoT scenario, highlights the application of the latest technologies, incorporation of hybrid methodologies in securing them, and also emphasizes on the open issues yet to be addressed and research challenges that are to be explored. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
772,Deriving adaptive long-term complementary operating rules for a large-scale hydro-photovoltaic hybrid power plant using ensemble Kalman filter,"The complementary operating rules of hydro-photovoltaic (PV) hybrid power plants have been explored fully to operate reservoirs for complementing the PV output. However, prevailing operating rules were constant, which is incapable to be dynamically updated based on new observations. To address this issue, adaptive complementary operating rules were developed to deal with the future uncertainties of reservoir inflow and solar radiation using ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). First, a long-term complementary optimization model was developed to derive the initial parameters of linear operating rules. Then, the optimal decisions under historical condition were used as the observation. Finally, six assimilation schemes were proposed, according to the two state transition equations (the same period of the previous year, the previous period) and three observations (the same period of the previous year, the previous period and their joint). China's Longyangxia hydro-PV hybrid power plant was chosen as a case study. Results show that (1) the two state transition equations have comparative effects on operation results, (2) the choice of observation plays a decisive role. The assimilation scheme, in which the optimal operation decision of the same period in previous year is as observation, outperforms the stationary operating rules. Specifically, the total power generation and guaranteed rate are improved by 7.14% and 5.33%, respectively, (3) the deriving framework works effectively under the synthetic nonstationary reservoir inflow and solar radiation, and ensures the stability and security of energy system in the changing environment. © 2021"
790,Edge Network Security Risk Control Based on Attack and Defense Map,"The standardized communication protocol and the universal application of intelligent electronic devices in edge networks provide technical support to the realization of smart cities and also bring network security issues that cannot be ignored. How to analyze and quantitatively assess the vulnerability of the edge network has become an important issue that needs to be solved urgently in the edge network security risk control. Based on the analysis of the vulnerability mechanism, this paper proposes the selection criteria and generation methods of vulnerability indicators and of composite vulnerability indicators, respectively. In addition, this paper proposes an improved vulnerability severity rating method to analyze the vulnerability of the system and potential security threats. This paper describes the security risk status of vulnerable points based on the state transition of the state offensive and defensive graph and implements the description of the security risk status of attacks in terms of attack frequency, attack success rate and harm. Experimental results justify the effectiveness of the proposed solution.  © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company."
792,Network Security Defense Decision-Making Method Based on Stochastic Game and Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Aiming at the existing network attack and defense stochastic game models, most of them are based on the assumption of complete information, which causes the problem of poor applicability of the model. Based on the actual modeling requirements of the network attack and defense process, a network defense decision-making model combining incomplete information stochastic game and deep reinforcement learning is proposed. This model regards the incomplete information of the attacker and the defender as the defender's uncertainty about the attacker's type and uses the Double Deep Q-Network algorithm to solve the problem of the difficulty of determining the network state transition probability, so that the network system can dynamically adjust the defense strategy. Finally, a simulation experiment was performed on the proposed model. The results show that, under the same experimental conditions, the proposed method in this paper has a better convergence speed than other methods in solving the defense equilibrium strategy. This model is a fusion of traditional methods and artificial intelligence technology and provides new research ideas for the application of artificial intelligence in the field of cyberspace security.  © 2021 Zenan Wu et al."
803,A survey of fog computing-based healthcare big data analytics and its security,"Growing use of wearables within internet of things (IoT) creates ever-increasing multi-modal data from various smart health applications. The enormous volume of data generation creates new challenges in transmission, storage, and processing. There were challenges such as communication latency and data security associated with processing medical big data in cloud backend. Fog computing (FC) is an emerging distributed computing paradigm that solved these problems by leveraging local data processing, storage, filtering, and machine intelligence within an intermediate fog layer that resides between cloud and wearables devices. This paper focuses on doing survey on two major aspects of deploying fog computing for smart and connected health. Firstly, the role of machine learning-based edge intelligence in fog layer for data processing is investigated. A comprehensive analysis is provided during the survey, highlighting the strength and improvements in the existing literature.

827,New Dataset for Industry 4.0 to Address the Change in Threat Landscape,"Because of its connectivity and its convergence with the IT world, industry 4.0 has become one of the main target sectors of the attackers. These last few years, they improve their operating mode and hit with more sophisticated attacks. Anomaly-based Intrusions Detection Systems (IDS) use datasets to train the classification algorithms they use to detect these attacks. Their detection capacity is therefore strongly linked to the representativeness of these datasets and the attacks they address. Actually, few datasets focus on the specificities of Industry 4.0 and even less propose a realistic labeled dataset. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to propose an industrial labeled dataset. It is characterized by several novelties consisting firstly in the fact that this data adds application features related to the industrial protocol Modbus. Then, it simulates twelve IT and OT attacks in a real environment. And finally in the labelling process, it contains 3 labels: one to characterize normal traffic, another for abnormal traffic and a specific label to distinguish the equipment reaction against an attack from the other types of data. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
850,An Online Identification Method of Key Transmission Sections for Thermal Stability Considering Cross-Region Faults and Security and Stability Control Measures,"Accurate and complete key transmission section identification has important significance to reduce power system monitoring range and prevent cascading failures. However, key transmission section identified by analysis of typical power system operating modes may not match power grid real-time operation situation when power grid structure is seriously damaged. Therefore, an online identification method of key transmission section considering cross-region faults and security and stability control measures is proposed in order to identify the weak sections that need to be concerned in power grid monitoring. Firstly, power flow distribution characteristics under different faults are analyzed based on results of online static stability analysis. Secondly, power flow transfer channels with different faults are identified and combined into transmission sections for thermal stability. The key transmission sections for thermal stability are screened by power transfer limit and margin calculation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by Northwest Power Grid. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
861,Agent-based approach to the design of a multimodal interface for cyber-security event visualisation control,"Convenient human-computer interaction is essential to carry out many exhausting and concentration-demanding activities. One of them is cyber-situational awareness as well as dynamic and static risk analysis. A specific design method for a multimodal human-computer interface (HCI) for cyber-security events visualisation control is presented. The main role of the interface is to support security analysts and network operators in their monitoring activities. The proposed method of designing HCIs is adapted from the methodology of robot control system design. Both kinds of systems act by acquiring information from the environment, and utilise it to drive the devices influencing the environment. In the case of robots the environment is purely physical, while in the case of HCIs it encompasses both the physical ambience and part of the cyber-space. The goal of the designed system is to efficiently support a human operator in the presentation of cyberspace events such as incidents or cyber-attacks. Especially manipulation of graphical information is necessary. As monitoring is a continuous and tiring activity, control of how the data is presented should be exerted in as natural and convenient way as possible. Hence two main visualisation control modalities have been assumed for testing: Static and dynamic gesture commands and voice commands, treated as supplementary to the standard interaction. The presented multimodal interface is a component of the Operational Centre, which is a part of the National Cybersecurity Platform. Creation of the interface out of embodied agents proved to be very useful in the specification phase and facilitated the interface implementation. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences.

871,Optimised adaptive control methodology for mode transition of hybrid electric vehicle based on the dynamic characteristics analysis,"Mode transition plays an important role in the operation of hybrid electric vehicles. The clutch is a key actuator for mode transition, but friction resulting from its use makes it difficult to achieve seamless mode transition. Moreover, as is usual in an electromechanical coupling system, the hybrid powertrain may exhibit complex dynamic behaviours as operating parameters change during mode transition. This paper considered changes in the clutch friction coefficient, and established a mathematical model of the hybrid powertrain in a parallel-series hybrid electric vehicle (PSHEV) during mode transition. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion and bifurcation theory are introduced to analyse the influence of speed difference on the dynamic characteristics of the hybrid powertrain, and the corresponding instability threshold were given. Furthermore, an optimised adaptive control methodology was proposed to control the dynamic behaviours, and tests on PSHEV were carried out. The results show that the variations of speed difference may lead to the occurrence of Fold and Hopf bifurcations, and that once the speed difference reaches the instability threshold, it may cause the system to enter a chaotic state and exhibit random oscillation. The proposed control methodology can effectively expand the security domain and suppress the oscillation to improve smoothness of mode transition. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
883,On Area Coverage Reliability of Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks with Multistate Nodes,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a special type of infrastructure-less network made up of a large number of tiny sensor nodes with limited energy, processing, and communication capabilities. WSNs have applications in health care, home security, environment monitoring, etc., with research challenges in energy efficiency, network lifetime, and network reliability. One of the major research challenges lies in providing application-specific coverage of the region of interest and reliable transmission of the gathered data to the mobile sink in the presence of multi-state sensor nodes. To quantify such a capability, this paper proposes a quantitative measure, called Area Coverage Reliability (ACR) for WSNs. ACR brings together WSN reliability, area coverage, energy efficiency, mobility of data collector or sink, random duty cycle of nodes, and multi-state nature of sensor nodes under a common umbrella. This paper proposes a Monte Carlo simulation approach that utilizes an energy matrix to evaluate the effect of energy-depleted nodes and energy-oriented data transfer capability on ACR. The energy matrix reflects the residual energy of sensors, the energy required to transmit data to the neighboring nodes, connectivity, and the multi-state nature of the sensors. The proposed approach is illustrated through a series of random examples. The ACR information allows the network designers to achieve a better understanding of the impact of random duty cycle, node energy, node/link reliability, and randomly deployed sensors on reliability. © 2001-2012 IEEE."

910,Cryptographic protection for military radio communications,"Protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is very important in any telecommunications system. Information protection requires use of necessary physical, personal, information and communication technologies and above all - electromagnetic and cryptographic security measures. Equipment and tools for cryptographic protection should be examined and assessed in terms of resistance to known threats. Additional requirements are put on information protection for radio communication, especially military, where radio transmission is characterized by uncertainty of establishing and maintaining connections, bit rates are relatively low, often without full duplex. All this has an impact on the methods of cryptographic synchronization and implementation of cryptographic functions. A different approach to information protection is required by classic narrowband radio communications, a different one in time-division multi-access modes, and another one in broadband packet data transmission. Systems designed for information protection in radio communications implement appropriate operating modes of operation for cryptographic algorithms and protocols. Latest threats from quantum computers pose new challenges, especially in systems using public-key cryptography, because there are algorithms that can be used to attack these schemes with polynomial complexity. © The Author(s).

969,An adaptive security approach according to the reliability level of drones using blockchain,"In drone environments using batteries, it is important to reduce unnecessary overhead. Also, for security of data, encryption is also an important factor. However, in the case of encryption, overhead is generated, but encryption and overhead are always in a trade-off relationship in this way. In this paper, in order to reduce overhead of drone, the concept of reliability was applied. We applied low level security to drone with high reliability to reduce overhead and conversely applied high level security to drone with low reliability. In order to adjust the security level, adjust the size of Key used for encryption and reduce the weight of the security algorithm itself. The reliability of the drone was determined based on the number of times of receiving data and by applying group reliability through drone grouping, it was made possible to determine hierarchical reliability. Moreover, by storing the communication records of all drones in the blockchain, the integrity of the reliability is guaranteed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019."
994,New Lightweight Architectures for Secure FSM Design to Thwart Fault Injection and Trojan Attacks,"Finite state machine (FSM) is a critical part in digital processing devices used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications as it controls complete functionality of the device. The synthesis tool implements deterministic FSM by adding extra don’t care states/transitions during optimization. This additional insertion makes the FSM vulnerable to setup-time violation based fault injection (STVFI) and hardware Trojan attacks. The existing techniques are inefficient to completely mitigate these vulnerabilities and exhibit significant design overhead. Therefore, this paper presents a novel lightweight secure machine design technique that completely mitigates the vulnerabilities with minimum overhead. The paper first proposes a new metric to identify all types of vulnerable transitions (VTs) followed by a trustworthy FSM design algorithm and efficient vulnerability mitigation architecture (EVMA). Though our EVMA completely alleviates the vulnerabilities to STVFI and Trojan attacks, it slightly increases the overhead due to additional multiplexers. Hence, we also propose new secure FSM design algorithm and two new lightweight vulnerability mitigation architectures (LVMA-I and LIVMA-II) that control the FFs using existing clear and/or preset pins instead of multiplexers. The experimental results on AES and RSA encryption modules show that the proposed technique detects 100% VTs. Further, ASIC and FPGA implementation of the proposed LIVMA-II using Cadence RTL and Xilinx Vivado presents on an average 40%, 59.6%, and 51.1% reduced area, power and delay respectively compared to the well-known technique.

996,Defensive strategy selection based on attack-defense game model in network security,"Security analysis and attack-defense modeling are effective methods to identify the vulnerabilities of information systems for proactive defense. The attack graph model reflects only attack actions and system state changes, without considering the perspective of the defenders. To assess the network information system and comprehensively show attack and defense strategies and their cost, a defense graph model is proposed. Compared with the attack graph, the model makes some improvements. The defense graph will be mapped to the attack and defense game model, in order to provide a basis for active defense policy decision. Moreover, a generation algorithm of defense graph is proposed. A representative example is provided to illustrate our models and demonstrate the high efficiency of the algorithm. © 2018 Totem Publisher, Inc. All rights reserved."
1001,Verifying the long-run behavior of probabilistic system models in the presence of uncertainty,"Verifying that a stochastic system is in a certain state when it has reached equilibrium has important applications. For instance, the probabilistic verification of the long-run behavior of a safety-critical system enables assessors to check whether it accepts a human abortcommand at any time with a probability that is sufficiently high. The stochastic system is represented as probabilistic model, a long-run property is asserted and a probabilistic verifier checks the model against the property. However, existing probabilistic verifiers do not account for the imprecision of the probabilistic parameters in the model. Due to uncertainty, the probability of any state transition may be subject to small perturbations which can have direct consequences for the veracity of the verification result. In reality, the safety-critical system may accept the abort-command with an insufficient probability. In this paper, we introduce the first probabilistic verification technique that accounts for uncertainty on the verification of longrun properties of a stochastic system. We present a mathematical framework for the asymptotic analysis of the stationary distribution of a discrete-time Markov chain, making no assumptions about the distribution of the perturbations. Concretely, our novel technique computes upper and lower bounds on the long-run probability, given a certain degree of uncertainty about the stochastic system. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery."
1005,Adaptive security architecture for protecting RESTful web services in enterprise computing environment,"In this modern era of enterprise computing, the enterprise application integration (EAI) is a well-known industry-recognized architectural principle that is built based on loosely coupled application architecture, where service-oriented architecture (SOA) is the architectural pattern for the implementation of EAI, whose computational elements are called as “services.” Though SOA can be implemented in a wide range of technologies, the web services implementation of SOA becomes the current selective choice due to its simplicity that works on basic Internet protocols. Web service technology defines several supporting protocols and specifications such as SOAP and WSDL for communication with client and server for data interchange. A new architectural paradigm has emerged in SOA in recent years called REpresentational State Transfer (REST) that is also used to integrate loosely coupled service components, named RESTful web services, by system integration consortiums. This SOA implementation does not possess adequate security solutions within it, and its security is completely dependent on network/transport layer security that is obsolete owing to latest web technologies such as Web 2.0 and its upgraded version, Web 3.0. Vendor security products have major implementation constraints such as they need secured organizational environment and breach to SOA specifications, hence introducing new vulnerabilities. Herein, we examine the security vulnerabilities of RESTful web services in the view of popular OWASP rating methodologies and analyze the gaps in the existing security solutions. We hence propose an adaptive security solution for REST that uses public key infrastructure techniques to enhance the security architecture. The proposed security architecture is constructed as an adaptive way-forward Internet-of-Things (IoT) friendly security solution that is comprised of three cyclic parts: learn, predict and prevent. A novel security component named “intelligent security engine” is introduced which learns the possible occurrences of security threats on SOA using artificial neural networks learning algorithms, then it predicts the potential attacks on SOA based on obtained results by the developed theoretical security model, and the written algorithms as part of security solution prevent the SOA attacks. This paper is written to present one of such algorithms to prevent SOA attacks on RESTful web services along the discussion on the obtained results of the conducted proof-of-concept on the real-time SOA environment. A comparison of the proposed system with other competing solutions demonstrates its superiority. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
1013,Multi-mode cryptocurrency systems,"In the past years, the security of Bitcoin-like protocols has been intensively studied. However, previous investigations are mainly focused on the single-mode version of Bitcoin protocol, where the protocol is running among full nodes (miners). In this paper, we initiate the study of multi-mode cryptocurrency protocols. We generalize the recent framework by Garay et al. (Eurocrypt 2015) with new security definitions that capture the security of realistic cryptocurrency systems (e.g. Bitcoin with full and lightweight nodes). We provide the first rigorous security model for addressing the ""blockchain bloat"" issue. As an immediate application of our new framework, we analyze the security of existing blockchain pruning proposals for Bitcoin aiming to improve the storage efficiency of network nodes by pruning unnecessary information from the ledger. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery."
1020,A stochastic game for adaptive security in constrained wireless body area networks,"Using Internet of Things (IoT) in the health domain is one of the most promising approaches which offer a ubiquitous healthcare where sensors are used, in real time, for constant monitoring of patient's symptoms and needs wherever he is. Wireless body area network (WBAN) is a highly suitable communication tool for the medical IoT devices. However, the conception of WBAN applications is still a challenging job that should take into consideration many technical requirements such as network lifetime, security level, network throughput and data criticality and prioritization. As a consequence, a trade-off between security effectiveness, energy efficiency, and QoS requirements can be perceived as a major performance objective. In this paper, we propose a stochastic game to balance the tradeoff between network performance and security level while taking into account the context dynamics. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve an acceptable security level and is more efficient than benchmark algorithms in terms of network lifetime and throughput. © 2018 IEEE."
1029,Towards a novel protocol analysis framework for industrial control systems,"Nowadays industrial controls systems (ICS) are becoming more and more robust and intelligent, owing to the development of industrial networking technology. While, on the other hand, security issues arise and pose great challenges. Among these issues, the security of ICS protocols receives the attention from both academy and industry in recent years. Due to the close and proprietary nature of industrial protocols, it is difficult to conduct protocol analysis and protection on these protocols. To address this issue, we propose a novel protocol analysis framework, named ICS-PAS, for ICS protocols. ICS-PAF could differentiate unknown protocols and their command types, extract protocol format and recognize the data types of protocol payloads. In addition, ICS-PAF could also infer and model the state transition of ICS protocols. ICS-PAS requires no prior knowledge and could deal with binary protocols. We also conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the performance of ICS-PAS. The results show that ICS-PAS outperforms traditional approaches in terms of recognition accuracy and efficiency. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018."
1082,"A lightweight, adaptive security mechanism","Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) allow vehicles to exchange information with other vehicles [vehicle to vehicle (V2V)] and with nearby roadside infrastructures [vehicle to infrastructure (V2I)] in real time, thus providing a number of value-added services to create a safer and more efficient traffic environment [59]. Due to factors closely related to driving safety and even potential life risk, VANETs impose stringent conditions on communication quality and security protection for timely and reliable information dissemination. Unlike the traditional wired network, VANETs are characterized by numerous new features, e.g., quick movement and unstable channel. These characteristics cause many challenging issues and limitations, e.g., bandwidth shortage, latency sensitivity, and serious Doppler effects, all of which make simultaneously harmonizing quality of service (QoS) and security difficult. To address these technical issues in an organizational way, European Telecommunications 188Standards Institute/International Organization for Standardization (ETSI/ISO) jointly proposed a horizontal/vertical mixture as the intelligent transport systems (ITS) station reference architecture. Such elaborate design structure enables the joint optimization of two seemingly conflicting topics of the communication quality and security and facilitates the redesign of the related protocols and controlling algorithms to optimally utilize the restrictive resources. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
1088,Fast and adaptively secure signatures in the random oracle model from indistinguishability obfuscation (short paper),"Indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) is a powerful cryptographic tool often employed to construct a variety of core cryptographic primitives such as public key encryption and signatures. In this paper, we focus on the employment of iO in order to construct short signatures with strong security guarantees (i.e., adaptive security) that provide a very efficient signing process for resource-constrained devices. Sahai and Waters (SW) (STOC 2014) initially explored the construction of iO -based short signature schemes but their proposal provides selective security. Ramchen and Waters (RW) (CCS 2014) attempted to provide stronger security guarantees (i.e., adaptive security) but their proposal is much more computationally expensive than the SW proposal. In this work, we propose an iO -based short signature scheme that provides adaptive security, fast signing for resource-constrained devices and is much more cost-efficient than the RW signature scheme. More precisely, we employ a puncturable PRF with a fixed length input to get a fast and adaptively secure signature scheme without any additional hardness assumption as in the SW signature scheme. To achieve this goal, we employ the technique of Hofheinz et al. called “delayed backdoor programming” using a random oracle, which allows to embed an execution thread that will only be invoked by special inputs generated using secret key information. Furthermore, we compare the cost of our signature scheme in terms of the cost of the underlying PRG used by the puncturable PRF. Our scheme has a much lower cost than the RW scheme, while providing strong security guarantees (i.e., adaptive security). © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG."
1100,An online power system static security assessment module using multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function network,"Efficient contingency screening and ranking method has gained importance in modern power systems for its secure operation. This paper proposes two artificial neural networks namely multi-layer feed forward neural network (MFNN) and radial basis function network (RBFN) to realize the online power system static security assessment (PSSSA) module. To assess the severity of the system, two indices have been used, namely active power performance index and voltage performance index, which are computed using Newton-Raphson load flow (NRLF) analysis for variable loading conditions under N - 1 line outage contingencies. The proposed MFNN and RBFN models based PSSSA module, are fed with power system operating states, load conditions and N - 1 line outage contingencies as input features to train the neural network models, to predict the performance indices for unseen network conditions and rank them in descending order based on performance indices for security assessment. The proposed approaches are tested on standard IEEE 30-bus test system, where the simulation results prove its performance and robustness for power system static security assessment. The comparison of severity obtained by the neural network models and the NRLF analysis in terms of time and accuracy, signifies that the proposed model is quick, accurate and robust for power system static security evaluation for unseen network conditions. Thus, the proposed PSSSA module implemented using MFNN and RBFN models are found to be feasible for online implementation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1108,Selections of suitable UAV imagery’s configurations for regions classification,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are used to conduct a variety of recognition as well as specific missions such as target tracking, safe landing. The transmitted image sequences to be interpreted at ground station usually face limited requirements of the data transmission. In this paper, on one hand, we handle a surveillance mission with segmenting a UAV video’s content into semantic regions. We deploy a spatio-temporal framework that considers UAV videos specific characteristics for segmenting multi regions of interest. After post-processing steps on the segmentation results, a support vector machine classifier is used to recognize regions. In term of temporal feature, we combine the results from the previous frames by proposing to use a state transition formulating through a Markov model. On the other hand, this study also assesses the influences of data reduction techniques on the proposed techniques. The comparisons between the untreated configuration and control conditions under manipulations of the frame rate, spatial resolution, and compression ratio, demonstrate how these data reduction techniques adversely influence the algorithm’s performance. The experiments also point out the optimal configuration in order to obtain a trade-off between the target performance and limitation of the data transmission. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016."
1137,Context aware adaptive security service model,"Present systems and devices are usually protected against different threats concerning digital data processing. The protection mechanisms consume resources, which are either highly limited or intensively utilized by many entities. The optimization of these resources usage is advantageous. The resources that are saved performing optimization may be utilized by other mechanisms or may be sufficient for longer time. It is usually assumed that protection has to provide specific quality and attack resistance. By interpreting context situation of business services - users and services themselves, it is possible to adapt security services parameters to countermeasure threats associated with current situation. This approach leads to optimization of used resources and maintains sufficient security level. This paper presents architecture of adaptive security service, which is context-aware and exploits quality of context data issue. © 2015 SPIE."
1139,ROCKIT: Roadmap for conversational interaction technologies,"ROCKIT is a strategic roadmapping action in the area of multimodal conversational interaction technologies funded as a support action by the EU during 2014 and 2015. We envisage a future in which human-human, human-machine, and human-environment communication are not hampered by differences in language capability, accessibility, or knowledge of the technology, and where security and privacy are built in. These future conversational interaction technologies will enable interaction, collaboration, creativity, and information access within a vast, dynamic, heterogeneous, and partly ephemeral information space. ROCKIT is developing a roadmap to achieve this vision, linking research and innovation activities, and connecting a broad range of stakeholders. In this paper we present the ROCKIT roadmapping process, together with five target scenarios, which we believe can form a basis for discussion and engagement at the ICMI workshop which can further progress the community roadmap."
1172,Characterization of failure effects on AADL models,"Prior works on model-based Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) automatically generate a FMEA table given the system model, a set of failure modes, and a set of possible effects. The last requirement is critical as bias may occur: since the considered failure effects are restricted to the anticipated ones, unexpected effects - the most interesting ones - are disregarded in the FMEA. In this paper, we propose and investigate formal concepts that aim to overcome this bias. They support the construction of FMEA tables solely based on the system model and the failure modes, i.e., without requiring the set of effects as input. More concretely, given a system specification in the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL), we show how to derive relations that characterize the effects of failures based on the state transition system of that specification. We also demonstrate the benefits and limitations of these concepts on a satellite case study. © 2013 Springer-Verlag."
1176,Verification and enforcement of access control policies,"Access control mechanisms protect critical resources of systems from unauthorized access. In a policy-based management approach, administrators define user privileges as rules that determine the conditions and the extent of users' access rights. As rules become more complex, analytical skills are required to identify conflicts and interactions within the rules that comprise a system policy - especially when rules are stateful and depend on event histories. Without adequate tool support such an analysis is error-prone and expensive. In consequence, many policy specifications are inconsistent or conflicting that render the system insecure. The security of the system, however, does not only depend on the correct specification of the security policy, but in a large part also on the correct interpretation of those rules by the system's enforcement mechanism. In this paper, we show how policy rules can be formalized in Fusion Logic, a temporal logic for the specification of behavior of systems. A symbolic decision procedure for Fusion Logic based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) is provided and we introduce a novel technique for the construction of enforcement mechanisms of access control policy rules that uses a BDD encoded enforcement automaton based on input traces which reflect state changes in the system. We provide examples of verification of policy rules, such as absence of conflicts, and dynamic separation of duty and of the enforcement of policies using our prototype implementation (FLCheck) for which we detail the underlying theory. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

For improving the performance regarding dynamic stability, self-healing, security, as well as economical and environmental benefit, this paper proposes a hierarchical management and control strategy for the high-penetrated distribution grid based on multi-agent systems structure via intelligent switching of operating mode. Corresponding to the complex hybrid behaviors, the hierarchical control scheme is designed as a three-level decentralized coordinated hybrid control. The simulation studies certify that the hierarchical hybrid control is effective and feasible to deal with comprehensive problems of high-penetrated distribution grids. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A major objective of an information security policy is to ensure that information is always available to support critical business processing. This is a great challenge to develop secure software to meet its requirements and to satisfy security requirements i.e. Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) against identified risks. To prevent sensitive data, creating session mechanism is used which is helpful in reducing denial of service attack.

1229,"Adapt-lite: Privacy-aware, Secure, and efficient mhealth sensing","As healthcare in many countries faces an aging population and rising costs, mobile sensing technologies promise a new opportunity. Using mobile health (mHealth) sensing, which uses medical sensors to collect data about the patients, and mobile phones to act as a gateway between sensors and electronic health record systems, caregivers can continuously monitor the patients and deliver better care. Although some work on mHealth sensing has addressed security, achieving strong security and privacy for low-power sensors remains a challenge. We make three contributions. First, we propose Adapt-lite, a set of two techniques that can be applied to existing wireless protocols to make them energy efficient without compromising their security or privacy properties. The techniques are: adaptive security, which dynamically modifies packet overhead; and MAC striping, which makes forgery difficult even for small-sized MACs. Second, we apply these techniques to an existing wireless protocol, and demonstrate a prototype on a Chronos wrist device. Third, we provide security, privacy, and energy analysis of our techniques. © 2011 ACM."
1240,Giving RFID a REST: Building a web-enabled EPCIS,"The Electronic Product Code Information Service (EPCIS) is a standard which defines interfaces enabling RFID events to be captured and queried. The query interface, implemented with WS-* Web services, enables business applications to consume and share data within and across companies, to form a global network of independent EPCIS instances. However, the interface limits the application space to the rather powerful platforms which understand WS-* Web services. In this paper we propose seamlessly integrating this network into the Web by designing a RESTful (REpresentational State Transfer) architecture for the EPCIS. Using this approach, each query, tagged object, location or RFID reader gets a unique URL that can be linked to, exchanged in emails, browsed for, bookmarked, etc. Additionally, this paradigm shift allows Web languages like HTML and JavaScript to directly use RFID data to fast-prototype light-weight applications such as mobile applications or Web mashups. We illustrate these benefits with a JavaScript mashup platform that integrates several services on the Web (e.g., Twitter, Wikipedia, etc.) with RFID data to allow managers along the supply chain and customers to get comprehensive data about their products. ©2010 IEEE."
1275,A specification-based testing framework for web service-based software,"As a rapidly emerging technology, Web services offer a brand-new mechanism for program-to-program interactions over the Internet. Inevitably, this programming pattern brings great challenge to the improvement of the quality and reliability of Web services. In the paper, a two-level testing framework for WSBS is proposed through deeply analyzing the architecture of WSBS and black-box character of Web service unit. In service unit level, combinatorial testing method is used to ensure single service's reliability through extracting interface information from WSDL file. In system level, BPEL specification is converted into state diagram at first, and then state transition- based test cases generation algorithm is presented. In addition, the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach is validated by some examples."

We assume that the mobiles use power storage element, such as rechargeable Solar- powered batteries, in order to have energy available for later use. By modeling the energy-level of Solar-powered batteries as a stochastic process, we study noncooperative interactions within large population of mobiles that interfere with each other through many local interactions. Each local interaction involves a random number of mobiles. The actions taken by a mobile determine not only the immediate payoff but also the state transition probabilities of its battery.

The reliability and safety function, computed from the transition probability of the Markov process, provides a proper quantitative measure of the fault tolerant control system because it incorporates the deadline, failure detection and fault isolation, permanent and correlated fault. State transition diagram was established based on the state transition of the system. State transition equation could be obtained by state transition diagram. Different state probability diagrams were acquired with different parameters of failure rate, recovery rate from transient fault, failure detection rate and fault isolation rate. © 2008 IEEE."
1300,A framework of combining intrusion detection and continuous authentication in mobile ad hoc networks,"Two complementary classes of approaches exist to protect high security mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), prevention-based approaches, such as authentication, and detection-based approaches, such as intrusion detection. Most previous work studies these two classes of issues separately. In this paper, we propose a framework of combining intrusion detection and continuous authentication in MANETs. In this framework, multimodal biometrics are used for continuous authentication, and intrusion detection is modeled as sensors to detect system security state. We formulate the system and use dynamic programmingbased algorithms to derive the optimal schemes for both intrusion detection and continuous authentication. Simulation examples show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. ©2008 IEEE."

1329,Efficient software model checking of data structure properties,"This paper presents novel language and analysis techniques that significantly speed up software model checking of data structure properties. Consider checking a red-black tree implementation. Traditional software model checkers systematically generate all red-black tree states (within some given bounds) and check every red-black tree operation (such as insert, delete, or lookup) on every red-black tree state. Our key idea is as follows. As our checker checks a red-black tree operation o on a red-black tree state s, it uses program analysis techniques to identify other red-black tree states s' 1, s'2, ..., s'k on which the operation o behaves similarly. Our analyses guarantee that if o executes correctly on s, then o will execute correctly on every s'i. Our checker therefore does not need to check o on any s'i once it checks o on s. It thus safely prunes those state transitions from its search space, while still achieving complete test coverage within the bounded domain. Our preliminary results show orders of magnitude improvement over previous approaches. We believe our techniques can make model checking significantly faster, and thus enable checking of much larger programs and complex program properties than currently possible. Copyright © 2006 ACM."

Mainstream security depends on equipment-based security mechanisms, which are a concern in terms of security issues as a whole. The necessity of strong security for Electronic Commerce has increased as a result of the whole process and the devices used. This thesis proposes an appropriate security management system TDM which is enforced security management system for E-Commerce. The idea of QoSS and a Threat-Adaptive Security Policy is examined in detail in order to apply a conceptual approach to the XML document which is a standard data format for data exchange including that of the Internet.

Based on earlier work on monads, we present a way of securely encapsulating stateful computations that manipulate multiple, named, mutable objects, in the context of a non-strict, purely-functional language. The security of the encapsulation is assured by the type system, using parametricity. The same framework is also used to handle input/output operations (state changes on the external world) and calls to C. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers."
1412,Blockchain based Secured Virtual Machine Image Monitor,"Blockchain technology supports data immutability. Whereas, smart contracts are piece of self-executable codes running inside the blockchain network, responsible for the transformation or state change of these data. Furthermore, Cloud Computing is used in the application of data storage and usage. Several business enterprises use cloud for hosting their applications and data with a minimized effort, cost and hurdles of maintenance. However, ensuring security of client data and proper management of the Service Provider's infrastructure remains a crucial issue. In this article, an Ethereum based blockchain network has been proposed that monitors and assures the safety of the VirtualMachine Images (VMI) stored at the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) end. The proposed scheme tends to design a dedicated Smart Contract which handles each and every function, starting from request of a VMI by the Cloud Service Consumer (CSC) to the usage of the same by the later. The use of blockchain technology ensures that no single admin/third party can control/modify the system. This prevents unwanted modification of the VMIs by an intruder and guarantees the efficiency of the scheme to be higher than any other methodology designed for the same purpose till date."
1438,Multi-modal and multi-sensor approach to support security management tasks,"Recent changes in the dynamic characteristics of security and emergency management requirements have a big impact on the development of more effective security systems. Innovative solutions have to provide support for new security challenges and newly developed operational strategies. Widely used security concepts based on video sensor solutions are being replaced by high-performance multi-sensor systems, which allow monitoring of outdoor areas with various sizes independent of lighting and weather conditions. Apart from the sensors used, the system effectiveness depends on innovative automatic data analysis including AI methods to enable generation of a comprehensive near real-time representation of a given situation. This work describes a concept and an experimental prototype of a self-sufficient, independent multi-sensor system for monitoring of critical personal behavior in the context of events, border area surveillance and critical infrastructure monitoring. The specific security scenarios were defined and worked out in detail in close cooperation with security experts. In order to ensure 24/7 operational capability, the work focuses on a flexible sensor platform concept and includes optical, thermal and radar sensors which are synergistically employed. Furthermore, innovative approaches to multi-sensor AI-based data analysis and web-based mobile information management solutions were developed as part of the nationally funded research project WatchDog to enable a targeted, scenario oriented support of the security forces. © 2019 by the authors."
1441,A game theoretic approach for responding to cyber-attacks on nuclear power plants,"As digital systems are being more widely employed in nuclear power plants, the potential for serious consequences caused by cyber-attacks on the plants has drawn increasing attention to cyber-security issues in the nuclear industry. Current practices focus on strategies for preventing cyber-attacks, while little research has been done on how to respond to cyber-attacks when they are detected. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach for responding to cyber-attacks on nuclear power plants. The interaction between the defender and the attacker is modeled as a two-player, nonzero-sum, stochastic game, which generalizes both Markov decision processes (MDP) and repeated games. We propose an approach for identifying system states and state transitions, and apply probabilistic risk assessment to obtain credible transition probabilities between system states under the action pair of defender and attacker. The Nash Equilibrium of the game provides the valid prediction of both players' actions because no single player can benefit from unilaterally deviating from the equilibrium policy if the other player adheres to his/hers, hence it provides the best response of the defender to cyber-attacks. Dynamic programming represents the long-term cumulative utility in a recursive form and we form an equivalent nonlinear program to derive the equilibrium. As a case study, the proposed approach is applied to a simplified benchmark digital feedwater control system. The modeling of the system is presented, and discussions on both the equilibrium policy and state values obtained are provided. © 2018 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC All Rights Reserved"
1445,Generalized adaptive security for computer systems,"Developing technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and the advent of Big Data Analytics have posed newer threats to security and consequently increased the security threat significantly and necessitated a more sophisticated approach to deal with the multitude of devices and systems which connect and communicate online. Thus, the earlier goal of building a robust security solution for a system or application is no longer a valid solution. Instead, the systems these days demand are adaptive solutions which will automatically detect and configure itself for the changing situations. The solution to this challenge needs the applications of soft computing technologies like learning systems and Artificial Intelligence to learn, predict, prevent and defend any unforeseen security threats. This is the goal of the adaptive security mechanism and this paper proposes a model to dynamically change for the security solution for the scenario and the application demand. © 2018 Newswood Limited."

Mutual understanding in the front end of projects has been helped by advances in modeling, design and simulation.

1468,Incorporating reliability attributes into the maintenance rule for the qualified life extension of nuclear power plant safety systems,"The aging of nuclear plants, the upgrading of safety systems and the concern for life extension of licensed plants has been a concern of regulatory agencies. The extension of operating licenses for power reactors has been a viable option for nuclear power plants operators to ensure the adequacy of future capacity of power generation, in terms of economic benefits, compared with the construction of new power reactors. Active equipment is considered as adequately monitored under the existing regulatory process where aging effects that might occur are more easily detectable and therefore corrected by the testing program, by the maintenance program or through the indicators highlighted in its performance. The NRC Maintenance Rule is a prerequisite for the license renewal for US plants, and it provides an aging management tool for active equipment. The purpose of this paper is to present a model that can be implemented in a personal computer, which allows the reliability analysis of nuclear power plant safety systems, starting from a state transition diagram, typically employed in Markovian reliability analyses. Considering the equipment qualified life extension, the classical Markovian model will not apply if at least one of the transition rates in the state transition diagram is time-dependent, due to equipment aging. To overcome this difficulty, the model is recast into a Markovian model by means of supplementary variables. The key feature here is the definition of maintenance procedures in the context of the maintenance program that are also adequate for the qualified life extension license. The algorithm developed for this purpose also estimates the necessary parameters for the reliability analysis, starting from crude failure information available from the plant and using goodness of fit statistical tests for the most commonly employed probability distributions, like the Weibull distribution."

1504,Computer immunodeficiency: Analogy between computer security and HIV,"Current security systems are designed to prevent foreseeable attacks. Those security systems do not prevent effectively the more emergent types of attacks, like a botnet, whose presence and behavior is difficult to predict. In order to predominate those types of attacks, we advocate an adaptive security approach based on the animal immune system. But since those sophisticated attacks can also be directed at the security systems themselves, leading to computer immunodeficiency, like HIV, in this paper we propose a protocol that protects the immune system itself. This approach discriminates between attacks on the security systems, which are part of the computer immune system, and attacks on other vital computer systems in an information infrastructure."
1525,Safety via state transition language plus invariants,"Liveness and safety properties are discussed from the standpoints of their topological characterizations and their expressibility in a state transition language with added invariants. The strengths of the languages obtained by varying the exact definition of the interval of invariance are analyzed. With the help of the topological characterizations, it is shown that pure liveness cannot be used to prove safety."
