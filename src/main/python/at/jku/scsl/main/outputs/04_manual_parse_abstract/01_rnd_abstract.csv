12,Privacy-mode switching: Toward flexible privacy protection for RFID tags in Internet of Things,"The privacy problem becomes the biggest obstacle when applying the RFID technology to personal customers usage in Internet of Things. Privacy protection is in the cost of computational overhead and feasibility loss, and necessary for privacy-sensitive usages. We propose a RFID system in which the privacy protection can be turned on or off by validate authorities. The privacy-mode switching increases diversity of RFID usage, enables RFID recycles, and has limited hardware overhead for RFID tags. Based on a symmetric-key crypto-based mutual authentication protocol called OMHSO, we describe a construction of a RFID system with flexible privacy-mode switching."
47,A Steady-state Alarm Analysis Approach Base on Finite Automata and Moving Window Algorithm,"Owing to a great variety of unprocessed and unanalyzed signal in the power system operation, the dispatchers face challenges from the high-intensity work, meanwhile, which brings security risks. Aiming at this phenomenon, this paper proposes a power system steady-state Alarm Analysis Approach base on Finite automata and Moving window (A3FM). The A3FM model is designed to describe the transition of power network state, and real-time analysis of power system steady-state alarm. The practical application shows that A3FM can discriminate the target signal sequence, analyze the grid operation in real time and have the certain capacity of fault tolerance. It provides the basis for real-time power grid status monitor and operation decision. On this basis, it improves the security of power grid by reducing the risks of manual operation mistakes in high pressure."
48,Mobile information catalog surveillance,"Context based Mobile Information Catalog Surveillance is a mobile phone based communication application. This application will give the notification to the user whenever they want to communicate with their mobile virtually. This application proved to get the recent call logs details when you send a command as message to the Android mobile device. It is used on Business point of view surveillance and Security. If the user need to surveillance his mobile and he need to access the last message, call logs or you need to access the contacts which may be important, our application will get such information and pass them in the text message format to the commander mobile. We can also change to profile mode, divert the calls to other mobile and get the location of the mobile through GPS. The commander is the owner who sent the command to the mobile to surveillance his mobile."
52,Computational Security for Context-Awareness in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks,"Vehicular ad hoc networks can be viewed as a typical context-aware system where the experienced context frequently varies as vehicles move along road, e.g., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), velocity, and traffic flow. In particular, the adopted security protection mechanisms often depend on the node state, location, and/or surrounding risk, which need the capability of context-aware security quantification. This paper views the security level as a user's inherent property that is only correlated with the user's behaviours and the situated context and independent of the suffered attack ways. We propose a formalized methodology to especially quantify the security level in real time from the perspective of state transition probability through estimating the stable probability of staying in the security state in inhomogeneous continuous time Markov chain. This paradigm enables users to customize the security protection mechanisms for adapting to the frequently varying context. We conduct the extensive numerical calculations and empirical analysis to comprehensively investigate the response of the proposed security quantification framework to the various combinations of the concerned parameters, e.g., SNR, velocity, and traffic flow. The results show that the proposed framework is capable of capturing the real-time security level adaptively to the vehicular context and provides a dependable decision basis to security protection, which can restrict the security to a target value."
71,Using Conditional Random Fields to Optimize a Self-Adaptive Bell–LaPadula Model in Control Systems,"Once defined, the access control policies and regulations would never be changed in a running and state transition process. However, it will give attackers the possibility of discovering vulnerabilities in the system, and the control systems lack the ability of dynamic perception of security state and risk, causing the systems to be exposed to risks. In this article, a dynamic Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model is proposed. The conditional random field (CRF) is introduced into the BLP model to optimize the rules. First, the model formalizes the security attributes, states of system, transition rules, and constraint models on the basis of the state transition of CRFs. After the historical system access logs are processed as the original dataset, a feature selection method is proposed to extract the requests and current states as feature vectors. Second, this article presents a rules training algorithm based on L-BFGS to implement the study and training of datasets, and then marks the logs in the test set through Viterbi algorithm automatically. On the base of these, a rule generation algorithm is proposed to dynamically adjust the access control rules based on the current security status and events of the system. Third, the security of CRFs-BLP is proved by theoretical analysis. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the model are verified by estimating the value of the precision, recall, and F1-score. As the system threats are shown to be decreased obviously from these experiments, this dynamic model can decrease the vulnerabilities and risk effectively."
80,Agent Based Cybersecurity Model for Business Entity Risk Assessment,"Computer networks and surging advancements of innovative information technology construct a critical infrastructure for network transactions of business entities. Information exchange and data access though such infrastructure is scrutinized by adversaries for vulnerabilities that lead to cyber-attacks. This paper presents an agent-based system modelling to conceptualize and extract explicit and latent structure of the complex enterprise systems as well as human interactions within the system to determine common vulnerabilities of the entity. The model captures emergent behavior resulting from interactions of multiple network agents including the number of workstations, regular, administrator and third-party users, external and internal attacks, defense mechanisms for the network setting, and many other parameters. A risk-based approach to modelling cybersecurity of a business entity is utilized to derive the rate of attacks. A neural network model will generalize the type of attack based on network traffic features allowing dynamic state changes. Rules of engagement to generate self-organizing behavior will be leveraged to appoint a defense mechanism suitable for the attack-state of the model. The effectiveness of the model will be depicted by time-state chart that shows the number of affected assets for the different types of attacks triggered by the entity risk and the time it takes to revert into normal state. The model will also associate a relevant cost per incident occurrence that derives the need for enhancement of security solutions."
82,Survivability evaluation index systems and evaluation models for Wireless Sensor Networks,"Survivability evaluation index systems and evaluation models are important basis for evaluating network survivability. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a common system evaluation method, but it cannot reflect the mutual influence among evaluation indexes. In order to overcome the defects of AHP, the survivability evaluation index set of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) in emergency communications is selected comprehensively, and establishes a survivability index system of WSN based on the Analytic Network Process (ANP). Then, a survivability evaluation model for clustering WSN based on semi-Markov Process (SMP) is put forward in this paper, and a SMP-based survival state transition diagram of cluster head is given. Survivability evaluation index systems and evaluation models are not only helpful to accessing the survivability of WSN in emergency communications objectively and effectively, but also to providing reference basis for the actual deployment and application of WSN."
106,Runtime System Support for CPS Software Rejuvenation,"Software rejuvenation, which was originally introduced to deal with performance degradation due to software aging, has recently been proposed as a mechanism to provide protection against run-time cyber attacks in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Experiments have demonstrated that CPSs can be protected from attacks that corrupt run-time code and data by periodically restoring the run-time system with an uncorrupted image. Control theoretic and empirical methods have been developed to determine the timing and mode-switching conditions for CPS software rejuvenation (CPS SR) that will guarantee system safety. This paper presents the requirements that need to be met by the run-time system to support CPS SR. It also presents an implementation and demonstration of the run-time system for the PX4 autopilot system for autonomous vehicles."
160,Preserving Contextual Privacy for Smart Home IoT Devices With Dynamic Traffic Shaping,"Internet of Things (IoT) enables physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to interoperate and exchange data with other systems over the Internet. Privacy is a huge concern for IoT devices as personal information is constantly being shared through them. Though the best industrial standards like end-to-end encryption are being followed to ensure content-based privacy, contextual privacy concerns still exist. This study focuses on user activity inference attacks, where a passive network observer can infer the private in-home activity of a user by analyzing encrypted IoT traffic metadata. Most of the previous solutions addressing these attacks have either reduced the usability of the devices, increased data overhead, or failed against packet-level signature-based attack scenarios. This study introduces a new defense mechanism that combines dummy packet generation with dynamic link padding. This process makes it difficult for the adversary to avail contextual information about the state of the device (ON or OFF), along with the temporal information (time of state change) from encrypted IoT traffic metadata. We reverse the packet-level signature-based attacks to get device-specific signatures, which helps us generate dummy traffic for the duration of device-specific signatures. Consequently, this results in increased false positives for device state identifications and low traffic overhead. We simulate a state-of-the-art attack scenario to test and vindicate our solution over existing data sets."
180,Steady state and dynamic security assessment in composite power systems,Security analysis is one of the important issues in power system reliability evaluation. A probabilistic method using sequential Monte Carlo simulation is introduced for modeling and integration of steady state and dynamic security assessment in computing the reliability indices. These system indices provide quantitative measures of the system operating states for use in short and long term planning. Case studies of the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) system and IEEE reliability test system (RTS) are described to demonstrate this approach.
188,Multi-mode SDR VSAT against big disasters,"As a result of the great east Japan earthquake, terrestrial communication infrastructure was seriously damaged. Thus the importance of secure satellite communication measures based on very small aperture antenna terminal (VSAT) systems has been recognized. In order to satisfy the various demands for urgent life line recovery, we have started an R&D project of “Satellite Communication Networks Valid for Disaster Recovery” as the next generation VSAT system. This project contains following three research topics. (1) multi-mode VSAT's based on software defined radio (SDR) technology, (2) low power consumption VSAT's and (3) emergency mode adaptive bandwidth control technique for HUB earth station."
222,Designing a Reconfigurable Security Architecture for Wireless Sensor Networks,"Dynamic reconfiguration makes the applications running on a deployed sensor networks dynamically evolve during the lifetime of its deployment. Adaptive security system (ADAPSEC), a reconfigurable security architecture for wireless sensor networks is proposed in this paper to meet the secure needs imposed by dynamic reconfiguration. It encapsulates the security aspects related to protection of communication, resources and component loading and enforces application-specific, fine-grained security policies. Based on ADAPSEC, optimal security policies can be selected and enforced in sensor networks according to the observed external conditions, internal resource constraints and application requirements."
238,Dynamic security control using secure regions derived from a decision tree technique,"This paper describes a real time dynamic security control technique in which rules derived from a decision tree learner are used to determine the necessary control actions to make an insecure power system state secure. A representative set of system operating states are classified as transiently stable or unstable by the extended equal area criterion (EEAC) for fast evaluation of transient stability and used as a training set for the decision tree, which outputs a set of classification rules. Security control is achieved by selecting optimal control actions to change the current, insecure state into a state within a secure region, without violating the acquired security rules. The technique is demonstrated on the 39 bus New England test system."
300,Efficient Network Management System with DACS Scheme,"Where customers with different membership and position, use computers as in the university network systems, it often takes much time and effort for them to cope with the change of the system management. This is because the requirements for the respective computer usage are different in the network and security policies. In this paper, a new destination addressing control system (DACS) scheme for the university network services is proposed. The DACS scheme performs the network services efficiently through the communication management of a client. As the characteristic of DACS scheme, only the setup modification is required by a system administrator, when the configuration change is needed in the network server. Then, the setup modification is unnecessary by a customer, which shows a merit for both a system administrator and a customer. This paper describes the instruction and the prototype for DACS protocol as the implementation of DACS scheme. Then, the simplicity of the system management in DACS scheme, is examined from the customer and the system administrator viewpoints"
303,A Chinese Multi-modal Relation Extraction Model for Internet Security of Finance,"As the base of the whole economy and society, internet security of finance directly affects the overall development of the country. With the development of the Internet, it is essential to effectively extract the relation between financial entities from internet financial intelligence and build a financial security knowledge graph, which lays the foundation for monitoring of internet security of finance. For relation extraction of Chinese internet financial intelligence, the existing models are all based on single-modal text semantics ignoring the role of Chinese pictographic semantics, while the shape and structure of Chinese characters contains useful semantics. In addition, the pictographic semantic fusion method of Chinese text also needs to be improved for better performance. To solve these shortcomings, we propose a Chinese Multimodal Relation Extraction model (CMRE), which improves the relation extraction ability on the Chinese internet financial intelligence. In CMRE, we extract pictographic semantics based on Chinese character shape and structure. Furthermore, we design a novel multi-modal semantic fusion module based on improved Transformer to effectively fuse the text and pictographic semantics. Additionally, we design experiments on the Chinese literature dataset(Sanwen) to test the relation extraction capability of CMRE. Finally, we employ CMRE to extract relations between financial entities on the internet financial intelligence dataset(FinRE) to compare with other baseline models."
306,Context-Aware Security for Vehicles and Fleets: A Survey,"Vehicles are becoming increasingly intelligent and connected. Interfaces for communication with the vehicle, such as WiFi and 5G, enable seamless integration into the user's life, but also cyber attacks on the vehicle. Therefore, research is working on in-vehicle countermeasures such as authentication, access controls, or intrusion detection. Recently, legal regulations have also become effective that require automobile manufacturers to set up a monitoring system for fleet-wide security analysis. The growing amount of software, networking, and the automation of driving create new challenges for security. Context-awareness, situational understanding, adaptive security, and threat intelligence are necessary to cope with these ever-increasing risks. In-vehicle security should be adaptive to secure the car in an infinite number of (driving) situations. For fleet-wide analysis and alert triage, knowledge and understanding of the circumstances are required. Context-awareness, nonetheless, has been sparsely considered in the field of vehicle security. This work aims to be a precursor to context-aware, adaptive and intelligent security for vehicles and fleets. To this end, we provide a comprehensive literature review that analyzes the vehicular as well as related domains. Our survey is mainly characterized by the detailed analysis of the context information that is relevant for vehicle security in the future."
328,SMM Revolutions,"The System Management Mode (SMM) is a highly privileged processor operating mode in x86 platforms. The goal of the SMM is to perform system management functions, such as hardware control and power management. Because of this, SMM has powerful resources. Moreover, its executive software executes unnoticed by any other component in the system, including operating systems and hypervisors. For that reason, SMM has been exploited in the past to facilitate attacks, misuse, or alternatively, building security tools capitalising on its resources. In this paper, we discuss how the use of the SMM has been contributing to the arms race between system's attackers and defenders. We analyse the main work published on attacks, misuse and implementing security tools in the SMM and how the SMM has been modified to respond to those issues. Finally, we discuss how Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology, a sort of ""hypervisor in processor"", presents a possible answer to the issue of using SMM for security purposes."
335,Scalable Data Storage Design for Nonstationary IoT Environment With Adaptive Security and Reliability,"Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment has a dynamic nature with high risks of confidentiality, integrity, and availability violations. The loss of information, denial of access, information leakage, collusion, technical failures, and data security breaches are difficult to predict and anticipate in advance. These types of nonstationarity are one of the main issues in the design of the reliable IoT infrastructure capable of mitigating their consequences. It is not sufficient to propose solutions for a given scenario, but mechanisms to adapt the current solution to changes in the environment. In this article, we present a multicloud storage architecture called WA-MRC-RRNS that combines the weighted access scheme, threshold secret sharing, and redundant residue number system with multiple failure detection/recovery mechanisms and homomorphic ciphers. We provide a theoretical analysis of the probability of information loss, data redundancy, speed of encoding/decoding, and show how to dynamically configure parameters to cope with different objective preferences, workloads, and cloud properties. We propose a multiobjective optimization mechanism to adjust redundancy, encryption-decryption speed, and data loss probability. Comprehensive experimental analysis with real data shows that our approach provides a secure way to mitigate the uncertainty of the use of untrusted and not reliable IoT infrastructure."
336,Security for space power systems,"An initial system security monitor (SSM) developed for the power system of a proposed NASA permanently manned space station is presented. Four types of ranked disturbances or faults to the transmission system are successively corrected by remedial action of the SSM. After each corrective action, the SSM verifies the system change that has been implemented, then proceeds to examine lower-priority disturbances if they persist. The SSM authority is limited by the operating state of the system, and only one correction is permitted for each scan cycle. The disturbance signals are verified by the use of a state estimator. The small network size permits use of connectivity searches of the network topology for possible corrective actions and a load flow to predict the effect of corrective actions. The data scan rate is higher than for earth-based systems. Line switching actions are implemented within line cycles because thyristors are used as circuit breakers. The work presents examples of disturbance identification and remedial action that could also apply to earth-based power systems.<>"
347,On Reusable Projective Garbling Schemes,"The popularity of network-based computation has increased during the past years. Storing data and performing computations using for example cloud services is commonplace nowadays. However, the information security in network-based computation rarely is satisfactory. One technique to improve information security for networked computations is based on secure multiparty computations. The idea of multiparty computation originates from Yao, who considered the secure computation with two parties by introducing the technique called garbled circuits. The technique was then generalized, but still the exact definitions for different security measures were not established until Bellare, Hoang and Rogaway proposed a definition of a garbling scheme and several security notions for garbling schemes. This gave inspiration to study the security properties of garbling schemes from different perspectives, including adaptivity and reusability. In this paper, we study the adaptive security for a certain type of reusable garbling schemes. First, we consider general constraints to achieve security for this specific type of garbling schemes. Then we analyze the adaptive security classes of reusable garbling schemes. More specifically, we prove a relation between security classes that has been left open in earlier research."
349,Adaptive Protective Relay Settings – A Vision to the Future,"Adaptive relaying utilizes the continuously changing status of the power system as the basis for online adjustment of the power system relay settings. Fundamentally they are protection schemes that adjust settings and/or logic of operations based on the prevailing conditions of the system. These adjustments can include, but are not limited to, the logging of data for post-mortem analysis, communication throughout the system, as well as changing relay parameters. Adaptive relaying considers the fact that the status of a power system can change. These include system configuration changes, load effect, cold load pickup, end-of-line protection, transformer protection, and automatic reclosing. In this research, the author focus on the need for a secure, selective, and reliable system for adaptive overcurrent protection in T&D and Distributed Energy Systems. Various types of adaptive methods are presented and explained along with some pros and cons of each."
384,Dynamic adaptive learning mobile agents for multi-modal input collaboration in home environment,Home server is developed to play the pivotal role of managing all home devices and multimedia content services through home networks. The possibility of a single user input device and single security agent to serve all the needs of the home is conventional to cope with the new technology revolution. The home server has to be enhanced to facilitate multi-modal inputs with multiple integrated user agents working together to facilitate all users at home. Processing of multiple input agents for dynamic context-aware output facilitates the system to learn adaptively using a probabilistic inference mechanism. We devise a hybrid collaboration architecture using fuzzy and neural agents to enhance our system operation to the trends of next generation home user requirements. Security in such a dynamic infrastructure is challenging. We devise mobile agents at each interface input device to manage multiple users using the mobile agent digital signatures to dynamically adapt to the context. The mobile agents are defined to operate the tasks on any mobile or stationary home device and collect the information needed for the home server. The system adapts to the dynamically changing user requirements and security context and produces the output based on the user's context
395,Modbus/DNP3 State-Based Intrusion Detection System,"The security of Industrial Critical Infrastructures is become a prominent problem with the advent of modern ICT technologies used to improve the performances and the features of the SCADA systems. In this paper we present an innovative approach to the design of Intrusion Detection Systems. The aim is to be able to detect complex attacks to SCADA systems, by monitoring its state evolution. By complex attack, we mean attacks composed of a set of commands that, while licit when considered in isolation on a single-packet basis, can disrupt the correct behavior of the system when executed in particular operating states. The proposed IDS detects these complex attacks thanks to an internal representation of the controlled SCADA system. We also present the corresponding rule language powerful enough to express the system's critical states. Furthermore, we present a prototype of the proposed IDS, able to monitor systems using the ModBus and DNP3 communication protocols."
408,Identification and Mitigation of False Data Injection using Multi State Implicative Interdependency Model (MSIIM) for Smart Grid,"Smart grid monitoring, automation and control will completely rely on PMU based sensor data soon. Accordingly, a high throughput, low latency Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure should be opted in this regard. Due to the low cost, low power profile, dynamic nature, improved accuracy and scalability, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be a good choice. Yet, the efficiency of a WSN depends a lot on the network design and the routing technique. In this paper a new design of the ICT network for smart grid using WSN is proposed. In order to understand the interactions between different entities, detect their operational levels, design the routing scheme and identify false data injection by particular ICT entities, a new model of interdependency called the Multi State Implicative Interdependency Model (MSIIM) is proposed in this paper, which is an updated version of the Modified Implicative Interdependency Model (MIIM) [1]. MSIIM considers the data dependency and operational accuracy of entities together with structural and functional dependencies between them. A multi-path secure routing technique is also proposed in this paper which relies on the MSIIM model for its functioning. Simulation results prove that MSIIM based False Data Injection (FDI) detection and mitigation works better and faster than existing methods."
416,Secured remote configuration approach for industrial cyber-physical systems,"Facilitating remote updates of configuration parameters for industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) is an emerging requirement due to interconnected production facilities. However, allowing remote configuration changes entail the following security issues. Malicious configuration updates through unprotected configuration interfaces can physically harm the ICPS or the respective process, and even threaten human lives. Also, for configuration interfaces to be remotely accessible, corporate networks need to be configured accordingly to provide access possibilities. Such additional access possibilities might then be used by adversaries when attacking corporate networks and thus, are often seen as a security weakness. If ICPS are not updated, outdated configurations also lead to security weaknesses. To mitigate these issues, we present a secured remote configuration approach for ICPS that protects the configuration interface as well as configuration data. The approach utilizes appropriate security measures and is realized as external configuration update module to allow easy verification of ongoing update processes."
420,"Multi-Robot System for Autonomous Cooperative Counter-UAS Missions: Design, Integration, and Field Testing","With the rapid development of technology and the proliferation of uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), there is an immediate need for security solutions. Toward this end, we propose the use of a multi-robot system for autonomous and cooperative counter-UAS missions. In this paper, we present the design of the hardware and software components of different complementary robotic platforms: a mobile uncrewed ground vehicle (UGV) equipped with a LiDAR sensor, an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) with a gimbal-mounted stereo camera for air-to-air inspections, and a UAV with a capture mechanism equipped with radars and camera. Our proposed system features 1) scalability to larger areas due to the distributed approach and online processing, 2) long-term cooperative missions, and 3) complementary multimodal perception for the detection of multirotor UAVs. In field experiments, we demonstrate the integration of all subsystems in accomplishing a counter-UAS task within an unstructured environment. The obtained results confirm the promising direction of using multi-robot and multi-modal systems for C-UAS."
433,Research on Security Assessment and Maintenance Decision of Trains Based on Bayesian Networks,"With the medium and low speed maglev train plays the role of commercial operation gradually, people put forward higher requirements for train safety reliability, which makes train security assessment even more prominent. Aiming at the characteristics of the maglev train equipments as well as the limitations of traditional security assessment, the establishment of a multi-state security assessment based on Bayesian network model has better diagnostic reasoning and causal reasoning ability. Finally, using the model to analysis the train traction system quantitatively, finding the weaknesses of the system and the relationship between the equipments to make rational maintenance decision. This will provide a basis to improve the reliability of train equipment and repair and maintenance work."
466,A protective relay voting scheme utilizing automation controllers,"This paper explores utilizing a programmable automation controller (PAC) in a power system relay protection scheme. The adaptive voting scheme (AVS) uses a wide-area measurement system (WAMS) to classify the system operating state, and biases the protection scheme towards security or dependability based on stressed or normal conditions, respectively. The use of an automation controller to integrate with WAMS devices and perform voting logic is proved highly effective. The injected delays from the PAC in the protection scheme are taken into consideration, and minimized to a maximum value of 3.18 ms."
473,Achieving secure chaotic communication using EKF-based embedded-keys system,"In this paper, we describe methods that simultaneously transmit keys and messages in a three-port secure chaotic communications network. These messages are decoded using a matrix representation of linear multivariable systems. Our approach consists of an optimal extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based observer, which is a linearization with time. We consider the observer with messages and the input with keys to be the transmitting agents. The optimal linearization technique is utilized to obtain the exact linear models of a chaotic system for operating states of interest. An EKF algorithm is used to estimate the parameters and states in which the message is already embedded. By combining the EKF with our optimal linear model, the message can be recovered on the receiver end. We provide numerical examples and simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology."
492,Deep Collaborative Multi-Modal Learning for Unsupervised Kinship Estimation,"Kinship verification is a long-standing research challenge in computer vision. The visual differences presented to the face have a significant effect on the recognition capabilities of the kinship systems. We argue that aggregating multiple visual knowledge can better describe the characteristics of the subject for precise kinship identification. Typically, the age-invariant features can represent more natural facial details. Such age-related transformations are essential for face recognition due to the biological effects of aging. However, the existing methods mainly focus on employing the single-view image features for kinship identification, while more meaningful visual properties such as race and age are directly ignored in the feature learning step. To this end, we propose a novel deep collaborative multi-modal learning (DCML) to integrate the underlying information presented in facial properties in an adaptive manner to strengthen the facial details for effective unsupervised kinship verification. Specifically, we construct a well-designed adaptive feature fusion mechanism, which can jointly leverage the complementary properties from different visual perspectives to produce composite features and draw greater attention to the most informative components of spatial feature maps. Particularly, an adaptive weighting strategy is developed based on a novel attention mechanism, which can enhance the dependencies between different properties by decreasing the information redundancy in channels in a self-adaptive manner. Moreover, we propose to use self-supervised learning to further explore the intrinsic semantics embedded in raw data and enrich the diversity of samples. As such, we could further improve the representation capabilities of kinship feature learning and mitigate the multiple variations from original visual images. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experimental evaluations conducted on four widely-used datasets show that our DCML method is always superior to some state-of-the-art kinship verification methods."
501,Managing IoT Cyber-Security Using Programmable Telemetry and Machine Learning,"Cyber-security risks for Internet of Things (IoT) devices sourced from a diversity of vendors and deployed in large numbers, are growing rapidly. Therefore, management of these devices is becoming increasingly important to network operators. Existing network monitoring technologies perform traffic analysis using specialized acceleration on network switches, or full inspection of packets in software, which can be complex, expensive, inflexible, and unscalable. In this paper, we use SDN paradigm combined with machine learning to leverage the benefits of programmable flow-based telemetry with flexible data-driven models to manage IoT devices based on their network activity. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We analyze traffic traces of 17 real consumer IoT devices collected in our lab over a six-month period and identify a set of traffic flows (per-device) whose time-series attributes computed at multiple timescales (from a minute to an hour) characterize the network behavior of various IoT device types, and their operating states (i.e., booting, actively interacted with user, or being idle); (2) We develop a multi-stage architecture of inference models that use flow-level attributes to automatically distinguish IoT devices from non-IoTs, classify individual types of IoT devices, and identify their states during normal operations. We train our models and validate their efficacy using real traffic traces; and (3) We quantify the trade-off between performance and cost of our solution, and demonstrate how our monitoring scheme can be used in operation for detecting behavioral changes (firmware upgrade or cyber attacks)."
524,Unmanned Research and Monitoring Vehicle,"Terrorism and insurgency are two of the most prevalent issues the globe is currently dealing with. Governments and scientists from all around the world are working around the clock to solve these issues. Nations invest tens of billions of dollars in the development of new defensive systems that can protect civilians from terrorist threats. Modern day counterterrorism activities are handled by sophisticated machines that are not only more effective but also responsible for saving many lives thanks to significant improvements in the field of vehicle automation. Autonomous ground vehicle although unmanned ground vehicles, or UGVs, are also known as self-controlled robots and are useful for military applications, there is an increasing demand for manual robots. UGV operate more effectively in remote areas and in the fight against terrorism. Unmanned ground vehicles support and improve the lives of soldiers on the front lines. The ability of this robot is primarily dependent on protecting the soldiers or at the very least lowering the number of casualties in battle. To create this prototype, which functions more effectively in military operations and counterterrorism, numerous studies have been conducted in significant regions of the world. This unmanned ground vehicle excels at border patrol, surveillance, and military operations. The two primary operating modes of this UGV are Automatic, or self-operation, and Manual, or cooperation with humans."
565,Responsibilities in the Cloud,"This chapter covers some of the contractual elements and technologies that make the relationship work, particularly application programming interfaces (APIs). Contracted cloud computing is unlike other operational modes and also unlike other managed IT service arrangements. In the case of cloud computing, the data owner ostensibly owns the information being stored and processed but does not have control over how it is stored and processed or who specifically handles the information (in terms of administration). Perhaps most intriguing of all, the data owner does not actually have physical access to the places and devices where that information is. The customer has all the responsibility and liability for protecting the information according to legal standards and regulation but often cannot mandate the actual protections and security measures in order to accomplish this. This leads to a very complex situation with a number of unique considerations. Some element of adversarial relationship exists between the cloud customer and cloud vendor because they have somewhat different goals. The cloud customer wants to maximize their computing capabilities and security of information while minimizing their costs. The cloud vendor wants to maximize its profits while minimizing what it has to provide (which is expressed in terms of computing capabilities and security of information). The primary intent for the cloud customer should be to meet business requirements. This could involve increasing efficiency, meeting regulatory needs, and ensuring durability of capabilities during contingencies, but it should always involve reducing cost."
603,Multi-Aspect Security Configuration Assessment,"Evaluating the security of a computer network system is a challenging task. Configurations of large systems are complex entities in continuous evolution. The installation of new software, a change in the firewall rules, or the discovery of a software vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious user to gain unauthorized control of the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the assets of an organization.This paper presents a framework for building security assessment tools able to perform online verification of the security of a system configuration. Heterogeneous data generated from multiple sources are integrated into a homogeneous RDF representation using domain-specific ontologies and used for assessing the security of a configuration toward known attack vectors. Different vocabularies can be defined to express configurations, policies and attacks for each aspect of the security of an organization (e.g., network security, physical security and application level security) in a modular way. By automatically extracting part of the configuration from the network system, the tool is able to detect in near real-time security threats created by configuration changes."
610,"Run-Time Generation, Transformation, and Verification of Access Control Models for Self-Protection","Self-adaptive access control, in which self-* properties are applied to protecting systems, is a promising solution for the handling of malicious user behaviour in complex infrastructures. A major challenge in self-adaptive access control is ensuring that chosen adaptations are valid, and produce a satisfiable model of access. The contribution of this paper is the generation, transformation and verification of Role Based Access Control (RBAC) models at run-time, as a means for providing assurances that the adaptations to be deployed are valid. The goal is to protect the system against insider threats by adapting at run-time the access control policies associated with system resources, and access rights assigned to users. Depending on the type of attack, and based on the models from the target system and its environment, the adapted access control models need to be evaluated against the RBAC metamodel, and the adaptation constraints related to the application. The feasibility of the proposed approach has been demonstrated in the context of a fully working prototype using malicious scenarios inspired by a well documented case of insider attack."
656,Towards Automated and Optimized Security Orchestration in Cloud SLA,"In cloud computing, providers pool their resources and make them available to customers. Next-generation computer scientists are flocking to the cutting-edge field of cloud computing for their research and exploration of uncharted territory. There are still several barriers that cloud service providers must overcome in order to provide cloud services in accordance with service level agreements. Each cloud service provider aspires to achieve maximum performance as per Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and this is especially true when it comes to the delivery of services. A cloud service level agreement (SLA) guarantees that cloud service providers will satisfy the needs of large businesses and offer their clients with a specified list of services. The authors offer a web service level agreement–inspired approach for cloud service agreements. We adopt patterns and antipatterns to symbolize the best and worst practices of OCCI (Open Cloud Computing Interface Standard), REST (Representational State Transfer), and TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) with DevOps solutions, all of which API developers should bear in mind when designing APIs. When using this method, everything pertaining to the cloud service, from creation to deployment to measurement to evaluation to management to termination, may be handled mechanically. When distributing resources to cloud apps, our system takes into account the likelihood of SLA breaches and responds by providing more resources if necessary. We say that for optimal performance, our suggested solution should be used in a private cloud computing setting. As more and more people rely on cloud computing for their day-to-day workloads, there has been a corresponding rise in the need for efficient orchestration and management strategies that foster interoperability. © 2023 International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication.

657,Neural-network-based event-triggered adaptive security path following control of autonomous ground vehicles subject to abnormal actuator signal,"The malicious physical attacks from both sensor and actuator sides make real threats to the security and safety of autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs). This paper focuses on the problem of neural-network-based event-triggered adaptive security control (ET-ASC) scheme for path following of AGVs subject to arbitrary abnormal actuator signal. First, we assume that an arbitrary abnormal signal is caused by arbitrary malicious attacks or disturbances from actuators. Then, radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) is used to reconstruct such abnormal actuator signal. Second, modelling issues on security path following control of AGVs with Sigmoid-like ETC scheme are shown when the AGV is suffering from abnormal actuator signal. In what follows, an ET-ASC scheme is developed to mitigate the adverse effects of abnormal actuator signal with the reconstructed abnormal signal based on a novel Sigmoid-like event-triggered communication scheme. By using the proposed RBF-NN-based ET-ASC scheme, (Figure presented.) control performance can be guaranteed under arbitrary malicious actuator signal rather than such attacks following a specific probability distribution. Final, some simulation experiments are provided to verify the effectiveness of proposed ET-ASC scheme. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
688,Measuring the vulnerability of bike-sharing system,"As a complex system, the bike-sharing system suffers from system failures, which can increase travel costs and impair user satisfaction. We proposed a concept of the vulnerability of bike-sharing system and a method to measure it. The method depends on the cost changes due to additional travel time induced by the failure of bike docking stations. It can capture the traffic mode transfer in the context of multi-modal traffic system, such as walking, bus, and subway. Moreover, to investigate the impact of network structure on the vulnerability, we developed the centrality measuring methods, and a community detection model for the bike-sharing system. Subsequently, the proposed methods are applied to Citi Bike in New York City, the largest bike-sharing system in the USA. The results show that the most vulnerable bike docking stations are located far from bus and railway stations, with low docking station density in their surrounding areas. We also found that the number of nearby bicycle stations, bus stops, and subway stations have a negative correlation with the vulnerability index. In contrast, the degree centrality and trip betweenness centrality are positively associated with the index. The proposed vulnerability analysis method can help urban planners to evaluate the design of a bike-sharing system and buttress operators to optimize maintenance planning. © 2022"
703,FIRE: A Finely Integrated Risk Evaluation Methodology for Life-Critical Embedded Systems,"Life-critical embedded systems, including medical devices, are becoming increasingly interconnected and interoperable, providing great efficiency to the healthcare ecosystem. These systems incorporate complex software that plays a significantly integrative and critical role. However, this complexity substantially increases the potential for cybersecurity threats, which directly impact patients’ safety and privacy. With software continuing to play a fundamental role in life-critical embedded systems, maintaining its trustworthiness by incorporating fail-safe modes via a multimodal design is essential. Comprehensive and proactive evaluation and management of cybersecurity risks are essential from the very design to deployment and long-term management. In this paper, we present FIRE, a finely integrated risk evaluation methodology for life-critical embedded systems. Security risks are carefully evaluated in a bottom-up approach from operations-to-system modes by adopting and expanding well-established vulnerability scoring schemes for life-critical systems, considering the impact to patient health and data sensitivity. FIRE combines a static risk evaluation with runtime dynamic risk evaluation to establish comprehensive risk management throughout the lifecycle of the life-critical embedded system. We demonstrate the details and effectiveness of our methodology in systematically evaluating risks and conditions for risk mitigation with a smart connected insulin pump case study. Under normal conditions and eight different malware threats, the experimental results demonstrate effective threat mitigation by mode switching with a 0% false-positive mode switching rate. © 2022 by the authors."
708,Specification and adaptive verification of access control policy for cyber-physical-social spaces,"Cyber-Physical-Social Space (CPSS) is a promising paradigm to provide people with an intelligent environment by emphasizing the deep fusion of cyberspace, physical space, and social space. The interdependence of these spaces makes that CPSS is more likely to be attacked. The attack consequences may directly affect the state of the physical world and even endanger the people's life. Thus, the most challenging issue for CPSS is to ensure the space security. However, existing security analysis methods focus on the static analysis at the design phase. They do not consider the open and dynamic characteristics which are the core features of CPSS. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security analysis framework for CPSS to prevent the unauthorized flow of information. Firstly, the access control model of CPSS is proposed. It controls the access behaviors by considering the space information covering the social, cyber, and physical spaces. Secondly, Labelled Transition System (LTS) is established to describe the future evolutions of CPSS. The space states in the LTS which violate the security requirements are reasoned by the model checking technology. Thirdly, a policy adjustment method is proposed to prevent the system from entering the violated states or mitigate the bad results caused by the violations. In the end, the effectiveness of our approach is evaluated by a smart building case, and the necessity of our approach is analyzed by the performance evaluation. © 2021"
717,Attribute-based signatures from lattices: unbounded attributes and semi-adaptive security,"We construct a lattice-based (key-policy) attribute-based signatures (ABS) scheme which supports attributes of unbounded polynomial length (the size of the public parameters is a fixed polynomial in the security parameter and a depth bound, with which one can generate signatures for attributes of arbitrary length). Our scheme does not rely on NIZKs, and we prove that our scheme is semi-adaptively unforgeable in the standard model; that is, the adversary can announce the challenge attribute after seeing the public parameters but before launching any query. Unlike our scheme, previous approaches either construct selectively unforgeable ABS schemes in the standard model that only support attributes of a-priori bounded polynomial length, or construct adaptively unforgeable ABS schemes that support attributes of unbounded polynomial length but relying on NIZKs. We adapt an existing technique developed by Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan for constructing lattice-based semi-adaptively secure (key-policy) attribute-based encryption (ABE) with unbounded attribute length. In particular, we use the adapted technique to generate an unbounded number of matrices out of a-priori bounded public matrices in the construction and program the challenge attribute into the public matrices in our semi-adaptive security proof. Moreover, to achieve adaptive signature query in our semi-adaptive security proof, we employ the traditional partitioning technique developed in identity-based systems to encode the message to be signed. Re-using and adapting lattice-based ABE technique and partitioning technique for lattice-based ABS should not be surprising since the three settings share many features, especially their security proof ideas. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
729,Physical Layer Security Based Enabling Technologies for 6G Communications Values,"Novel security primitives built on physical layer parameters gain interest for the design of the wireless 6G networks. Regarding key value indicators (KVI), the requirements for future 6G wireless networks are formulated. We select a subset of these KVIs, including safety, anonymity, scalability, sustainability, reliability, and resilience. First, the KVIs are defined. Next, we identify and review suitable physical layer security techniques, including selected results. They contain a coding theorem for arbitrarily varying wiretap channels with an informed jammer. Results on practical secret key generation are reviewed. Confidential stealth, and covert communications are included as well as certain differential privacy techniques. The zero-outage secrecy rate and ergodic secrecy rate maximization are briefly described, too. Finally, multi-mode fiber transmission, multiple-input multiple-output multiple-eavesdropper wiretap channels, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces are listed. We argue that these results and physical layer security techniques enable the envisaged KVIs. Finally, open gaps for future research are motivated and discussed.  © 2022 IEEE."
747,Security Challenges in 5G and IoT Networks: A Review,"5G networks are poised to satisfy the anticipated growth in Internet of Technology (IoT) devices and their related systems. The invasion of 5G networks brings along with it an accelerated need for security and privacy. The need for tailor-made security solutions has become the need of the hour to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and authentication in 5G-based IoT networks. Since IoT initiates sensors and actuators in a totally smart environment, IoT security will involve protecting the total deployment architecture of IoT from internal and external attacks. Integration of cryptographical algorithms and quantum cryptography has been used effectively to secure data in 5G networks. Privacy and identity management has been a mandatory requirement in networks carrying delicate data involved in retail shops, traffic services, and health monitoring systems. Securing data in 5G and IoT networks and detection of trustworthy and rogue nodes, proper monitoring, logging, and broadcasting are the vital necessities of any security system. The exhaustive survey on the security issues in the 5G-IoT scenario, highlights the application of the latest technologies, incorporation of hybrid methodologies in securing them, and also emphasizes on the open issues yet to be addressed and research challenges that are to be explored. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
751,The Application of Beidou and Ultra-Broadband Positioning Technology in the Power Security Protection System,"In the Beidou positioning system, due to the obstruction of obstacles, the indoor is often unable to obtain positioning information. For this case, a scheme based on Beidou indoor and outdoor integration positioning is proposed. First, the algorithms of satellite localization and ultra wide band localization are studied, and a high-precision positioning algorithm compatible with both positioning modes is proposed. Seamless switching algorithm can realize positioning mode switching without affecting positioning accuracy. Based on the research of algorithm model of substation, determine the layout mode and positioning accuracy, and solve the problem of weak signal of indoor positioning. This scheme guarantees the positioning accuracy in the practical application environment, and it provides a theoretical basis for the positioning of people and equipment in the power system. © 2022, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
752,Software-Defined Networking Security Challenges and Solutions: A Comprehensive Survey,"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has revolutionized the networking field by addressing scalability, flexibility, and control mechanism issues, which are present in Traditional Networks. One of the major advantages of SDN over Traditional Networks is centralized control over the network. In Traditional Networks, no separate Control Layer is present, due to which configuration and management of the network become extremely difficult. SDN introduces a separate Control Layer, which makes network management an easy and reliable process. Network management is now flexible and does not require expensive hardware and configuration changes. From this, not only the network administrator but also the network intruder benefits. SDN separates the Control and Data Plane of the Network. Due to the separation of the Control Plane, DoS/DDoS attacks on SDN Controller can cause a Single Point of Failure of the entire network, and hence security becomes vital for SDN. In this paper, the security challenges of all three layers of SDN, and solutions that need to be taken by the network administrator has been discussed. Various key benefits of SDN Security has been discussed in this paper. SDN security remains one of the hot topics in the field of networking, and our main goal remains to review the major security advancements, with their scope and limitations. © 2022 University of Bahrain.

758,Steady-State Availability Evaluation for Heterogeneous Edge Computing-Enabled WSNs with Malware Infections,"To evaluate the steady-state availability of heterogeneous edge computing-enabled wireless sensor networks (HECWSNs) with malware infections, we first propose a Stackelberg attack-defence game to predict the optimal strategies of malware and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) deployed in heterogeneous sensor nodes (HSNs). Next, we present a new malware infection model-heterogeneous susceptible-threatened-active-recovered-dead (HSTARD) based on epidemic theory. Then, considering the heterogeneity of sink sensor nodes and common sensor nodes and the malware attack correlation, we derive the state transition probability matrix of an HSN based on a semi-Markov process (SMP), as well as the steady-state availability of an HSN. Furthermore, based on a data flow analysis of HSNs, we deduce the steady-state availability of HECWSNs with various topologies, including the star topology, cluster topology, and mesh topology. Finally, numerical analyses illustrate the influence of the IDS parameters on the optimal infection probability of malware and reveal the effect of multiple factors on the steady-state availability of HSNs, including the initial infection rate, the infection change rate, and the malware attack correlation. In addition, we present data analyses of the steady-state availability of HECWSNs with various topologies, including the star topology, cluster topology, and mesh topology, which provide a theoretical basis for the design, deployment, and maintenance of high-availability HECWSNs.  © 2022 Hong Zhang et al."
762,Experimental Demonstration of a Multifunctional All-Optical Quantum State Transfer Machine,"Quantum information protocol with quantum resources shows a great advantage in substantially improving security, fidelity, and capacity of information processing. Various quantum information protocols with diverse functionalities have been proposed and implemented. However, in general, the present quantum information system can only carry out a single information protocol or deal with a single communication task, which limits its practical application in the future. Therefore, it is essential to develop a multifunctional platform compatible with multiple different quantum information protocols. In this Letter, by utilizing an all-optical platform consisting of a gain-tunable parametric amplifier, a beam splitter, and an entanglement source, we experimentally realize the partially disembodied quantum state transfer protocol, which links the all-optical quantum teleportation protocol and the optimal 1→N coherent state cloning protocol. As a result, these three protocols, which have different physical essences and functionalities, are implemented in a single all-optical machine. In particular, we demonstrate that the partially disembodied quantum state transfer protocol can enhance the state transfer fidelity compared with all-optical quantum teleportation under the same strength of entanglement. Our all-optical quantum state transfer machine paves a way to implement the multifunctional quantum information system. © 2021 American Physical Society."
771,ARTINALI++: Multi-dimensional Specification Mining for Complex Cyber-Physical System Security,"Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSes) have been investigated as a key area of research since they are the core of Internet of Things. CPSs integrate computing and communication with control and monitoring of entities in the physical world. Due to the tight coupling of cyber and physical domains, and to the possible catastrophic consequences of the malicious attacks on critical infrastructures, security is one of the key concerns. However, the exponential growth of IoT has led to deployment of CPSes without support for enforcing important security properties. Specification-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been shown to be effective for securing these systems. Mining the specifications of CPSes by experts is a cumbersome and error-prone task. Therefore, it is essential to dynamically monitor the CPS to learn its common behaviors and formulate specifications for detecting malicious bugs and security attacks. Existing solutions for specification mining only combine data and events, but not time. However, time is a semantic property in CPS systems, and hence incorporating time in addition to data and events, is essential for obtaining high accuracy. This paper proposes ARTINALI++, which dynamically mines specifications in CPS systems with arbitrary size and complexity. ARTINALI++ captures the security properties by incorporating time as a substantial property of the system, and generate a multi-dimensional model for the general CPS systems. Moreover, it enhances the model through discovering invariants that represent the physical motions and distinct operational modes in complex CPS systems. We build Intrusion Detection Systems based on ARTINALI++ for three CPSes with various levels of complexity including smart meter, smart artificial pancreas and unmanned aerial vehicle, and measure their detection accuracy. We find that the ARTINALI++ significantly reduces the ratio of false positives and false negatives by 23.45% and 73.6% on average, respectively, over other dynamic specification mining tools on the three CPS platforms. © 2021 Elsevier Inc."
783,Multi-state Risk-Based Maintenance Analysis of Redundant Safety Systems Using the Markov Model and Fault Tree Method,"The risk-based maintenance strategy has received special attention in the safe operation of nuclear power plants. Simultaneous quantification of the positive and negative effects of maintenance activities and components degradation effect makes it possible to accurately evaluate the risk criterion for safety systems of nuclear power plants. However, it is difficult to integrate the effects of maintenance and components degradation into the standard reliability approaches. A straightforward approach for considering components degradation and different maintenance policies is to make use of Markov maintenance models. In this article, the effectiveness of maintenance activities (including changes in the surveillance test intervals and alteration in the different maintenance policies) on the components unavailability with considering aging effects is quantified using Markov maintenance models and then by coupling these models and the fault tree method, the risk measure is upgraded from the component level to the system level. The proposed models are applied to evaluate the unavailability of two safety systems of VVER-1000/V446 nuclear power plants as case studies. The results show that the Markov method due to its multi-state nature is effective in the conservative evaluation of risk measures so that the unavailability computed by the coupling process is higher than the original unavailability (calculated by system fault tree using PSA data of nuclear power plants) for all maintenance policies. In addition, this study illustrates that the developed Markov maintenance models could be applied to the large-scale whole plant level and provides a proper transition from the classical PSA methods to new techniques. This approach integrates the effects of maintenance strategies and components degradation. Also, it provides a practical and a more accurate tool to determine the technical specification of a real nuclear power plant from the risk point of view. © Copyright © 2021 Mohammadhasani and Pirouzmand."
796,Reverse Firewalls for Adaptively Secure MPC Without Setup,"We study Multi-party computation (MPC) in the setting of subversion, where the adversary tampers with the machines of honest parties. Our goal is to construct actively secure MPC protocols where parties are corrupted adaptively by an adversary (as in the standard adaptive security setting), and in addition, honest parties’ machines are compromised. The idea of reverse firewalls (RF) was introduced at EUROCRYPT’15 by Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz as an approach to protecting protocols against corruption of honest parties’ devices. Intuitively, an RF for a party P is an external entity that sits between P and the outside world and whose scope is to sanitize P ’s incoming and outgoing messages in the face of subversion of their computer. Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz constructed a protocol for passively-secure two-party computation. At CRYPTO’20, Chakraborty, Dziembowski and Nielsen constructed a protocol for secure computation with firewalls that improved on this result, both by extending it to multi-party computation protocol, and considering active security in the presence of static corruptions. In this paper, we initiate the study of RF for MPC in the adaptive setting. We put forward a definition for adaptively secure MPC in the reverse firewall setting, explore relationships among the security notions, and then construct reverse firewalls for MPC in this stronger setting of adaptive security. We also resolve the open question of Chakraborty, Dziembowski and Nielsen by removing the need for a trusted setup in constructing RF for MPC. Towards this end, we construct reverse firewalls for adaptively secure augmented coin tossing and adaptively secure zero-knowledge protocols and obtain a constant round adaptively secure MPC protocol in the reverse firewall setting without setup. Along the way, we propose a new multi-party adaptively secure coin tossing protocol in the plain model, that is of independent interest. © 2021, International Association for Cryptologic Research."
812,"A comprehensive maritime benchmark dataset for detection, tracking and threat recognition","This paper describes a new multimodal maritime dataset recorded using a multispectral suite of sensors, including AIS, GPS, radar, and visible and thermal cameras. The visible and thermal cameras are mounted on the vessel itself and surveillance is performed around the vessel in order to protect it from piracy at sea. The dataset corresponds to a series of acted scenarios which simulate attacks to the vessel by small, fast-moving boats ('skiffs'). The scenarios are inspired by real piracy incidents at sea and present a range of technical challenges to the different stages in an automated surveillance system: object detection, object tracking, and event recognition (in this case, threats towards the vessel). The dataset can thus be employed for training and testing at several stages of a threat detection and classification system. We also present in this paper baseline results that can be used for benchmarking algorithms performing such tasks. This new dataset fills a lack of publicly available datasets for the development and testing of maritime surveillance applications.  © 2021 IEEE."
823,Specification of Quality Indicators for Security Event and Incident Management in the Supply Chain,"The paper proposes an approach to a formalized description of the process of changing the values of quality indicators of decision support for managing security events and incidents in the supply chain. The approach is based on the analysis of the functioning processes of modern quality control systems for information security in supply chain. In addition, it is based on an analysis of decision support processes. We use controlled Markov chains, represented by difference stochastic equations. The considered version of the analytical description of the state change in dynamics allows one to formalize, structure, and mathematically describe the process of this class from a uniform perspective. It is important to note that with this representation of the dynamics of state transitions, the requirements for operativity (timeliness), reliability, secrecy and resource costs for supporting decision-making to control information security in the supply chain are taken into account. © 2021.

830,Natural Interaction with Traffic Control Cameras Through Multimodal Interfaces,"Human-Computer Interfaces have always played a fundamental role in usability and commands’ interpretability of the modern software systems. With the explosion of the Artificial Intelligence concept, such interfaces have begun to fill the gap between the user and the system itself, further evolving in Adaptive User Interfaces (AUI). Meta Interfaces are a further step towards the user, and they aim at supporting the human activities in an ambient interactive space; in such a way, the user can control the surrounding space and interact with it. This work aims at proposing a meta user interface that exploits the Put That There paradigm to enable the user to fast interaction by employing natural language and gestures. The application scenario is a video surveillance control room, in which the speed of actions and reactions is fundamental for urban safety and driver and pedestrian security. The interaction is oriented towards three environments: the first is the control room itself, in which the operator can organize the views of the monitors related to the cameras on site by vocal commands and gestures, as well as conveying the audio on the headset or in the speakers of the room. The second one is related to the control of the video, in order to go back and forth to a particular scene showing specific events, or zoom in/out a particular camera; the third allows the operator to send rescue vehicle in a particular street, in case of need. The gestures data are acquired through a Microsoft Kinect 2 which captures pointing and gestures allowing the user to interact multimodally thus increasing the naturalness of the interaction; the related module maps the movement information to a particular instruction, also supported by vocal commands which enable its execution. Vocal commands are mapped by means of the LUIS (Language Understanding) framework by Microsoft, which helps to yield a fast deploy of the application; furthermore, LUIS guarantees the possibility to extend the dominion related command list so as to constantly improve and update the model. A testbed procedure investigates both the system usability and multimodal recognition performances. Multimodal sentence error rate (intended as the number of incorrectly recognized utterances even for a single item) is around 15%, given by the combination of possible failures both in the ASR and gesture recognition model. However, intent classification performances present, on average across different users, accuracy ranging around 89–92% thus indicating that most of the errors in multimodal sentences lie on the slot filling task. Usability has been evaluated through task completion paradigm (including interaction duration and activity on affordances counts per task), learning curve measurements, a posteriori questionnaires. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
835,Big Data,"Healthcare is perhaps one of the most important therapy fields of the new age. Health policy should use a vast variety of analytical knowledge to collect data and measurements of difficulty. It should be beneficial and able to predict patient well-being by evaluating diet, medical history, and social behavior. Hours is a broad health network. Good lifestyle-recommendations are included. Therefore, informal health networks have become critical collective decision-making structures. Maintaining efficient knowledge distribution, performance, security, and secrecy is a crucial goal. The Health Advisory Framework (HRS) is of great value in achieving results such as the analysis of clinical effects, preventive advantages, therapeutic options, and complementary medications focused on patient knowledge databases, and people are utilizing social networks to uncover their health issues. Present research in this chapter on massive amounts of medical data decreases healthcare expenditures by integrating multimodal data from different outlets. Big data analysis utilizing the Advice Platform plays an essential part, offering a smart HRS strategy that provides visibility into how large data analytics can be used as effective health advising engine and how the healthcare system can be transformed from a traditional to a more personalized model into a tele-health setting. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
872,Dynamic Security Metrics for Software-Defined Network-based Moving Target Defense,"We propose a suite of dynamic security metrics that timely, dynamically, and adaptively assess the effectiveness of the software-defined network (SDN)-based moving target defense (MTD) techniques. The security metrics are developed to measure the dynamics of a network and a host state's information (e.g., IP address, port, software stacks, vulnerabilities, or network topology) introduced by various types of MTD techniques shuffling them. The key aspect of our proposed metrics is to capture variability that keeps track of changing patterns of the network and the host states upon every MTD triggering event. In this work, we propose the following security metrics capturing the variability based on the changes made by the MTD: (1) Network and host address-based metrics measuring variability of the network and host addresses based on a degree of uncertainty and unpredictability on the assigned IP address to the hosts in a network; (2) Attack path-based metrics measuring variability of attack paths using graphical models estimated based on the network state transitions from one topology to another topology upon triggering a network topology and/or IP shuffling MTD; and (3) Attack stage-based success metrics measuring the chances of discovering a vulnerable target host's information, exploiting the target host's vulnerability, and compromising the target host. Via extensive simulation study, we investigated the key parameters that can significantly affect the MTD performance based on the proposed security metrics. Our simulation results show that the metrics are viable to measure the effectiveness of deploying the MTD techniques. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

902,Multi-mode collision avoidance closed-loop control system,"Autonomous vehicles are a research area of active interest. Collision avoidance system (CAS) is one of the central concerns to provide security protection for autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a multi-mode collision avoidance system (mCAS), which combines a trajectory prediction module, a risk assessment module and a motion planning module into the closed-loop system. At each step, the trajectory prediction module predicts the trajectories of the vehicle and surrounding vehicles. The risk assessment model calculates the collision probability and chooses reasonable control mode. Then the motion planning module designs the desired deceleration profile based on it. The car takes the first step of the planned deceleration and repeats this cycle, achieving closed-loop control. The mCAS is tested in a closed-loop simulation setup and the results show that the proposed mCAS is of good effectiveness and feasibility, which can significantly reduce collision probability as well as false alarms.

933,Mitigating information leakage during critical communication using S∗FSM,"Security-centric components and systems, such as System-on-Chip early-boot communication protocols and ultraspecific lightweight devices, require a departure from minimalist design constructs. The need for built-in protection mechanisms, at all levels of design, is paramount to providing cost-effective, efficient, secure systems. In this work, Securely derived Finite State Machines (S∗FSM) and power-aware S∗FSM are proposed and studied. Overall results show that to provide an S∗FSM, the typical FSM requires a 50% increase in the number of states and a 57% increase in the number of product terms needed to define the state transitions. These increases translate to a minimum encoding space increase of 70%, raising the average encoding length from 4.8 bits to 7.9 bits. When factoring in relaxed structural constraints for power and space mitigation, the respective increases of 53 and 67% raise the average number of bits needed to 7.3 and 7.9. Regarding power savings, current minimisation is possible for both FSMs and S∗FSMs through the addition of encoding constraints with average current reductions of 30 and 70%, respectively. Overall, a power-constrained S∗FSM consumes about 5% more power than insecure FSMs with binary encodings, though with a penalty of a 95% increase in layout area. © 2019 The Institution of Engineering and Technology."

970,"Hyper-spectral communications, networking & ATM: Progress and perspectives","In 2017 we reported on NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) University Leadership Initiative (ULI) program, and in particular the launching of our Hyper-Spectral Communications and Networking for Air Traffic Management (ATM) (HSCNA) project. The HSCNA project is the only ULI program to address communications and networking.

976,An attribute-based anonymous broadcast encryption scheme with adaptive security in the standard model,"In broadcast encryption schemes, a distribution center broadcasts an encrypted message to a subset chosen from a universe of receivers, and only the intended users are able to decrypt the message. Most broadcast encryption schemes do not provide anonymity, and the identities of target receivers are sent in plaintext. However, in several applications, the authorized users' identities have the same sensitivity as the broadcasted messages. Yu, Ren, and Lou (YRL) [Yu, S., Ren, K., and Lou, W. ""Attribute-based on-demand multicast group setup with membership anonymity"", Computer Networks, 54(3), pp. 377- 386 (2010).] considered this issue and introduced an efficient anonymous attribute-based broadcast encryption scheme. This paper first proposed an attack on the YRL scheme, and showed that the unauthorized receivers could also decrypt the broadcasted message. Next, we proposed the Improved-YRL scheme and proved that it achieved anonymity and semantic security under adaptive corruptions in the chosen ciphertext setting. The proof is provided by the dual system encryption technique and is based on three complexity assumptions in composite order bilinear maps. The Improved-YRL scheme is a step forward in solving the long-standing problem of secure and low overhead anonymous broadcast encryption. © 2019 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved."
979,Securing SCADA-based critical infrastructures: Challenges and open issues,"Conventionally, the security of critical infrastructures was mainly focused on environmental threats. Cyber attacks, nevertheless, have shifted the attention to various other threats and damages. The attackers try to exploit vulnerabilities in networks and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, since these technologies are the integral part of the critical systems. Therefore, the vulnerability of Critical Infrastructure (CI) against cyber threats has led the need to devise modern security measures. Unavailability or failure of one CI can cause enormous devastation and damage to the society, economy and stability by provoking cascading failures to many other related infrastructures. Traditional security measures attempt to cater well-known emerging threats; however, strong and adaptive security measures/techniques are inevitable to defend against innovative attacks. This paper presents a survey on cyber threats and defense measures to highlight the necessity for securing SCADA-based critical infrastructures and provides an insight into the security challenges and open issues in this regard. © 2019 The Authors.

987,Flux: A platform for dynamically reconfigurable mobile crowd-sensing,"Flux is a platform for dynamically reconfigurable crowd-sensing using mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, programmed under a notion of region-based sensing. Each region is defined by a set of physical constraints that determine the sensing scope, e.g., based on device position or other environmental variables, plus a set of periodic tasks that perform the actual sensing. The resulting behavior is inherently dynamic: as a device's state changes, e.g., moves in space, it enters and/or leaves different regions, thereby changing the set of active tasks; moreover, regions can be added, deleted, and reprogrammed on-the-fly. Flux makes use of a domain-specific language for sensing tasks that is compiled into abstract bytecode, later executed by a low-footprint virtual machine within a device, guaranteeing runtime safety by construction. For region/task dissemination, Flux employs a broker that holds a changeable region configuration plus gateways that mirror the configuration throughout different network access points to which devices connect. Sensing data is streamed by devices to gateways and then back to the broker. Live or archived data streams are in turn fed by the broker to data-processing clients, which interface with the broker using a publish/subscribe API. We conducted two case-study experiments illustrating Flux: a single-region deployment to monitor WiFi signal quality, and a multi-region deployment to monitor noise, temperature, and places-of-interest based on device movement. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery."
991,Detecting smartphone state changes through a Bluetooth based timing attack,"Bluetooth is a popular wireless communication technology that is available on most mobile devices. Although Bluetooth includes security and privacy preserving mechanisms, we show that a Bluetooth harmless inherent request-response mechanism can taint users privacy. More specifically, we introduce a timing attack that can be triggered by a remote attacker in order to infer information about a Bluetooth device state. By observing the L2CAP layer ping mechanism timing variations, it is possible to detect device state changes, for instance when the device goes in or out of the locked state. Our experimental results show that change point detection analysis of the timing allows to detect device state changes with a high accuracy. Finally, we discuss applications and countermeasures. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery."
1003,A multi-modal urban traffic agent-based framework to study individual response to catastrophic events,"Urban traffic is made of a variety of mobility modes that have to be taken into account to explore the impact of catastrophic event. From individual mobility behaviors to macroscopic traffic dynamics, agent-based modeling provides an interesting conceptual framework to study this question. Unfortunately, most proposals in the domain do not provide any simple way to model these multi-modal trajectories, and thus fell short at simulating in a credible way the outcomes of a catastrophic event, like natural or industrial hazards. This paper presents an agent-based framework implemented with the GAMA modeling platform that aims at overcoming this lack. An application of this model for the study of flood crisis in a district of Hanoi (Vietnam) is presented. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018."
1014,A note on dependence of epidemic threshold on state transition diagram in the SEIC cybersecurity dynamical system model,"Cybersecurity dynamical system model is a promising tool to describe and understand virus spreading in networks. The modelling comprises of two issues: the state transition diagram and the infection graph. Most works focus on proposing models (the state transition diagram) and studying the relationship between dynamics and the infection graph topology. In this paper, We propose the SEIC model and illustrate how the model transition diagram influence the dynamics, in particular, the epidemic threshold by calculating and comparing their thresholds in a class of Secure-Exposed-Infectious-Cured (SEIC) models. We show that as a new state enters the state transition diagram in the fashion of the SEIC model, the epidemic threshold increases, which implies that the model has a larger region of parameters to be stabilized. Numerical examples are presented to verify the theoretical results. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018."
1020,Interoperable Internet-of-Things platform for smart home system using Web-of-Objects and cloud,"Recent advancements in the Internet, web and communication technologies cut across many areas of modern-day living and enabled interconnection of every physical object, including, sensors and actuators. Web-enabled smart objects empower innovative services and applications for different domains and improve utilization of resources. In this paper, we propose an interoperable Internet-of-Things (IoTs) platform for a smart home system using a Web-of-Objects (WoO) and cloud architecture. The proposed platform controls the home appliances from anywhere and also provides the homes’ data in the cloud for various service providers’ applications and analysis. Firstly, we proposed a Raspberry PI based gateway for interoperability among various legacy home appliances, different communication technologies, and protocols. Secondly, we bring the smart home appliances to the web and make it accessible through the Representational State Transfer (REST/RESTful) framework. Thirdly, we will provide the cloud server for smart homes’ to store the homes’ data due to low storage capabilities at a gateway and provide the data for various application's service providers and analysis. In the proposed smart home platform, we implement a water-tank control using Zigbee communication, an automatic door security using a normal camera as an IP camera, and provide web connectivity to different home devices for web-based controlling. We aim to reduce the human intervention, secure access control to home devices from anywhere, provide smart homes data for application services as well as for analysis, and improve the utilization of resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"
1024,Advanced firewall mechanism with OpenFlow in SDN,"In recent years, penetration of Internet in the world is significantly increased due to technologies that enabled high speed broadband services, social networking and cloud based services. There is considerable increase in the number of users getting connected and hence large amount of user's vital data are flowing over Internet attracting serious threats and possible attacks from malicious users. To secure this free-flowing data, many security solutions have been presented, validated and implemented. But the majority of them are implemented with traditional networking techniques which itself is complex and hard to manage. This techniques primarily relies on manual configuration of devices which often results in policy conflicts that compromises network's security. This problem is addressed by Software Defined Networking, which breaks vertical integration by separating the control logic and data forwarding functionality, allowing flexible network architecture, network-wide visibility, simpler network management, etc. OpenFlow is the open standard that enables secure communication between controlling devices and data forwarding devices. In this paper, we propose and validate an approach to implement network-wide firewall in SDN by exploiting capabilities of OpenFlow standard to restrict flow of malicious and suspicious traffic flow in the network. © 2018 Authors."
1026,Expose data as a service in cloud for cooperative intelligent transportation systems-communicating with web application programming interfaces,"The accessibility of various traffic data archived by advanced data systems in intelligent transportation system (ITS) has been a critical issue to the efficient utilization of those valuable data. The constant growth in users and data systems brings more challenges in maintaining the performance of traditional data portals. This paper presents an approach in using representational state transfer web APIs for communication between data systems. It offers concise interfaces for data requests, efficient mechanisms for data transfers, and better management of data security and access restriction. The integration of transportation data to the cloud also makes it available to more end users and utilization. The components of a web-based traffic simulation platform demonstrated the consumption and production of web APIs. An ideal schema for transportation data services was suggested for transportation research, as well as an alternative schema due to lack of existing web APIs in the ITS community. © ASCE."
1038,Security Proof of KerNeeS Protocol Based on Logic of Events,"The Near Filed Communication (NFC) is widely used on mobile devices and make it possible to take advantage of NFC system to complete mobile payment. But with the development of NFC, its problem are increasingly exposed, especially the security and privacy of authentication. Logic of events is a formal method to describe the protocol state transition and algorithm in concurrent and distributed systems, which can be used to prove the security of network protocols. Based on logic of events, we propose migration rule and derive inheritability to reduce redundancy and complexity of protocol analysis procedure, and improve efficiency of protocol analysis. We study the KerNeeS protocol which providing mutual authentication between POS and NFC phone, and conclude that the protocol can guarantee authentication between entities involved in the payment for secure payment transactions. The logic of events can be applied to the formal analysis of similar mobile payment protocols. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
1088,Network security risk assessment method based on HMM and attack graph model,"The ever-increasing complexity of computer network and various new types of bugs make the network security become an ever-growing serious challenge. In the evaluation of network security risk, the cause-and-effect relationship between multiple attack steps can be described well in an attack graph model. However, its test result is uncertain. Focused on this issue, the method of fusing attack graph model and Hidden Markov model (HMM) was proposed. Firstly, the network environment and attacker's aggressive behavior were abstracted by the attack graph model; Secondly, the probabilistic mapping that was between network observation and attack status was established by the HMM; Finally, the Viterbi algorithm was used to calculate the maximum probability state transition sequence. Experimental results show that the maximum probability of the state transition sequence can be effectively calculated and then the attack intention can be accurately inferred by this dual model. This method provides a good configuration for network security administrators. © 2016 IEEE."

Based on these examples, the Trojan dynamic operating modes can be either accidentally or intentionally embedded, even in the most widely used structures. © 2015 IEEE."
1095,DNP3 network scanning and reconnaissance for critical infrastructure,"The Distributed Network Protocol v3.0 (DNP3) is one of the most widely used protocols to control national infrastructure. The move from point-to-point serial connections to Ethernet-based network architectures, allowing for large and complex critical infrastructure networks. However, networks and configurations change, thus auditing tools are needed to aid in critical infrastructure network discovery. In this paper we present a series of intrusive techniques used for reconnaissance on DNP3 critical infrastructure. Our algorithms will discover DNP3 outstation slaves along with their DNP3 addresses, their corresponding master, and class object configurations. To validate our presented DNP3 reconnaissance algorithms and demonstrate it's practicality, we present an implementation of a software tool using a DNP3 plug-in for Scapy. Our implementation validates the utility of our DNP3 reconnaissance technique. Our presented techniques will be useful for penetration testing, vulnerability assessments and DNP3 network discovery.

1105,Controlled management of confidentiality-preserving relational interactions,"This article builds on given fundamental concepts and a prototype implementation for history-aware and policy-driven inference control by means of a confidentiality-preserving security server, which mediates interactions between a relational database and a semihonest (human) user. Within this already broad-ranging framework, we enhance the prototype towards efficient and effective user administration and monitoring by introducing and verifying two interactive and semiautomatic functionalities. The first one serves for the administration of global settings and the initial state of each user’s internal surrogate. Reacting on a submitted interaction request, the second functionality handles the security server’s dynamic selection of an admissible confinement method and its actual application, together with a corresponding state transition of the requesting user’s surrogate. These functionalities employ extendible descriptors of surrogate states, interaction requests, database instances and confinement methods, respectively, as a kind of security labels. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016."
1110,Memory erasability amplification,"Erasable memory is an important resource for designing practical cryptographic protocols that are secure against adaptive attacks. Many practical memory devices such as solid state drives, hard disks, or file systems are not perfectly erasable because a deletion operation leaves traces of the deleted data in the system. A number of methods for constructing a large erasable memory from a small one, e.g., using encryption, have been proposed. Despite the importance of erasable memory in cryptography, no formal model has been proposed that allows one to formally analyse such memory constructions or cryptographic protocols relying on erasable memory. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we provide a formal model of erasable memory. A memory device allows a user to store, retrieve, and delete data, and it is characterised by a leakage function defining the extent to which erased data is still accessible to an adversary. Second, we investigate how the erasability of such memories can be amplified. We provide a number of constructions of memories with strong erasability guarantees from memories with weaker guarantees. One of these constructions of perfectly erasable memories from imperfectly erasable ones can be considered as the prototypical application of Canetti et al.’s All-or-Nothing Transform (AoNT). Motivated by this construction, we propose some new and better AoNTs that are either perfectly or computationally secure. These AoNTs are of possible independent interest. Third, we show (in the constructive cryptography framework) how the construction of erasable memory and its use in cryptographic protocols (for example to achieve adaptive security) can naturally be composed to obtain provable security of the overall protocol. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016."
1114,Key frame extraction for salient activity recognition,"Surveillance cameras have become big business, with most metropolitan cities spending millions of dollars to watch residents, both from street corners, public transportation hubs, and body cameras on officials. Watching and processing the petabytes of streaming video is a daunting task, making automated and user assisted methods of searching and understanding videos critical to their success. Although numerous techniques have been developed, large scale video classification remains a difficult task due to excessive computational requirements. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study to investigate effective architectures and semantic features for efficient and accurate solutions to activity recognition. We investigate different color spaces, optical flow, and introduce a novel deep learning fusion architecture for multi-modal inputs. The introduction of key frame extraction, instead of using every frame or a random representation of video data, make our methods computationally tractable. Results further indicate that transforming the image stream into a compressed color space reduces computational requirements with minimal affect on accuracy. © 2016 IEEE."
1117,A web-based cooperative tool for risk management with adaptive security,"Risk management can benefit from Web-based tools fostering actions for treating risks in an environment, while having several individuals collaborating to face the endeavors related to risks. During the intervention, the security rules in place to preserve resources from unauthorized access, might need to be modified on the fly, e.g., increasing the privileges of risk managers or letting rescue teams view the exact position of the victims. Modifications should respect the overall security policies and avoid security conflicts. This paper presents a dynamic access control model for environmental risks involving physical resources. Data structures included in our Web application to represent both risk and security are given. To keep the dynamic security rules compliant with overall organization security objectives, we consider rules grouped in Access Control Domains so that changes do not create security conflicts during collaboration in risk management. Considering work environments as an example, risk and access control models are introduced. Security is built on the ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control) paradigm. A Risk Management System (RMS) is illustrated: it captures events, signals potential risks, and outputs strategies to prevent the risk. Dynamic authorization is included in the RMS to vary subjects' privileges on physical resources based on risk level, people position and so on. These concepts are implemented in a prototype Web application appearing as a Web Dashboard for risk management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1124,Exploiting state obfuscation to detect hardware trojans in NoC network interfaces,"We propose to exploit state obfuscation to facilitate hardware Trojan (HT) detection in the network interfaces (NIs) of Network-on-Chips (NoCs). The security of IP cores connected with the NoC infrastructure has been widely studied in previous work; however, countermeasures for the security threats in NoCs themselves lack investigation. In the first phase of our method, we add key bits to the finite state machine of the NI control unit and create dummy states to increase the difficulty for the execution of meaningful attacks. In the second phase, we examine the illegal states and illegal state transitions induced by a wrong key to detect the occurrence of HTs. Simulation results show that our method obtains a HT detection rate of over 97.5% and reduces the probability of a successful HT attack by 71.5%. Our synthesized netlist with a 65nm technology shows that the NI using the proposed method only increases the area overhead by 3.2%, over the baseline NI design. © 2015 IEEE."
1139,A punctured programming approach to adaptively secure functional encryption,"We propose the first construction for achieving adaptively secure functional encryption (FE) for poly-sized circuits (without complexity leveraging) from indistinguishability obfuscation (iO). Our reduction has polynomial loss to the underlying primitives. We develop a “punctured programming” approach to constructing and proving systems where outside of obfuscation we rely only on primitives realizable from pseudo random generators. Our work consists of two constructions. Our first FE construction is provably secure against any attacker that is limited to making all of its private key queries after it sees the challenge ciphertext. (This notion implies selective security.) Our construction makes use of an we introduce called puncturable deterministic encryption (PDE) which may be of independent interest. With this primitive in place we show a simple FE construction. We then provide a second construction that achieves adaptive security from indistinguishability obfuscation. Our central idea is to achieve an adaptively secure functional encryption by bootstrapping from a one bounded FE scheme that is adaptively secure. By using bootstrapping we can use “selective-ish” techniques at the outer level obfuscation level and push down the challenge of dealing with adaptive security to the one bounded FE scheme, where it has been already been solved. We combine our bootstrapping framework with a new “key signaling” technique to achieve our construction and proof. Altogether, we achieve the first construction and proof for adaptive security for functional encryption. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2015."
1147,Adaptive security for risk management using spatial data,"This paper presents the design principles for adaptive security for areas where changing conditions trigger events signaling risks that might require modifying authorizations of risk management teams. Spatial resources and information of the areas to be protected are considered in sample scenarios, and principles of security design are introduced building on ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control). Adaptivity of security rules applying to subjects who intervene in the risk area is the core of our security model so as to make it responsive to risks by dynamically granting privileges to subjects to access resources. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland."
1198,An adaptive security framework delivered as a service for cloud environment,"Cloud computing is a flexible, cost effective and proven delivery platform for providing business or consumer IT services over the Internet. Despite of all the hype surrounding the cloud, enterprise customers are still reluctant to deploy their business in the cloud. This study proposes a security framework that provides security as a service for cloud applications. This framework provides security as a single-tier or multi-tier based on the application's demand. Moreover, these tiers are enabled to change dynamically making the entire security system less predictable. The behavior of this framework is designed to be customizable based on the application's importance and is localized. This design will help the cloud in adverse situations of threats because the threats will also be localized and will not pose a threat to the entire cloud. In a cloud where there are heterogeneous asset systems, a single security system would be too costly for certain applications and if there is less security then the vulnerability factor of some applications like financial and military applications will shoot up. This consideration is incorporated within the framework which enables security levels based on the importance of the assets of the services provided by the cloud and their respective clients. The framework was tested and the results were positive. ©Medwell Journals, 2012."
1206,Reliability attributes and the maintenance rule for nuclear power plant safety systems,"The Maintenance Rule (MR) is a requirement established by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to check the effectiveness of maintenance carried out in nuclear plants. MR was consolidated in the U.S. in 1996. MR classifies Structures, System or Components (SSC) into two categories: Category (a)(2), the SSCs that reach the intended performance demonstrate that preventive maintenance is being appropriately performed, and category (a)(1), which stands for the SSCs that do not fulfill category (a)(1), and must have established goals, so that the discrepancies can be revised and then return to Category (a)(2). The purpose of this paper is to present a model that can be implemented in a personal computer, which allows the reliability analysis of nuclear power plant safety systems to be performed, starting from a state transition diagram, typically employed in Markovian reliability analyses. The classical Markovian model will not apply if at least one of the transition rates in the state transition diagram is time-dependent, due to equipment aging. To overcome this difficulty, the model is recast into a Markovian model by means of supplementary variables. The algorithm developed for this purpose also estimates the necessary parameters for the reliability analysis, starting from crude failure information available from the plant and using goodness of fit statistical tests for the most commonly employed probability distributions.

1207,Accelerating adaptive background modeling on low-power integrated GPUs,"Background modeling is a key initial step in many video surveillance applications. As more and more smart cameras are deployed for surveillance tasks across the globe, an efficient background modeling technique is required that balances accuracy, speed, and power. Due to its high parallel computational characteristics, robust adaptive background modeling has been implemented on GPUs with significant performance improvements over CPUs. However, these implementations are infeasible in embedded applications due to the high power ratings of the targeted general-purpose GPU platforms. We propose implementing a fast, adaptive background modeling algorithm on a low-power integrated GPU, the NVIDIA ION, with thermal design power (TDP) of only 12 watts. This paper focuses on how data and thread-level parallelism is exploited and memory access patterns are optimized to target this algorithm to a low-power GPU. We achieve a frame rate of 100fps on a full resolution VGA (640x480) frame. This is a 6X speed-up compared to a CPU platform of comparable TDP. © 2012 IEEE."
1220,A probabilistic risk analysis for multimodal entry control,"Entry control is an important security measure that prevents undesired persons from entering secure areas. The advanced risk analysis presented in this paper makes it possible to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable entries, based on several entry sensors, such as fingerprint readers, and intelligent methods that learn behavior from previous entries. We have extended the intelligent layer in two ways: first, by adding a meta-learning layer that combines the output of specific intelligent modules, and second, by constructing a Bayesian network to integrate the predictions of the learning and meta-learning modules. The obtained results represent an important improvement in detecting security attacks. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1319,What is trackable?,"We have developed a general framework, called a Process Query System (PQS), that serves as a foundation for formulating tracking problems, implementing software solutions to tracking problems and understanding theoretical issues related to tracking in specific scenarios. The PQS framework posits that an environment consists of multiple dynamical processes. Processes have states, state transitions (deterministic, nondeterministic or probabilistic) and observables related to state occupancy. Examples of such dynamical processes are nondeterministic automata, Hidden Markov Models and classical state space models. We define a tracking problem as the inverse problem of determining the processes and process states that explain a stream of observations. This paper describes a quantitative concept of trackability by considering the rate of growth of state sequences of a process model given a temporal sequence of observations. Recent formal results concerning this notion of trackability are summarized without proof. Complete proofs of the various results are contained in a technical report by the authors and cited in the bibliography."
1330,Adaptive mode switching for internetworking of MANET and WLAN based on HMIPv6,"For extending of hot-spot of wireless LAN (WLAN), [1] proposes internetworking scheme between WLAN and mobile ad-hoc network (MANET), which employ the same layer-2 protocol with different mode. Compared to internetworking schemes between UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems) and WLAN [3-4], the scheme from [1] has relatively low overhead and latencies because WLAN and MANET are physically and logically similar to each other. However, the mode switching algorithm proposed in [1] for internetworking only considers signal strength and determines handoff, and mobile nodes following a zigzag course in pollution area may frequently perform handoff at short intervals. Furthermore, [1] employs mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) at base, which brings still high delay on handoff and overhead due to signal message exchange. In this paper, we present optimized internetworking scheme between WLAN and MANET, modified from [1]. To settle ping-pong handoff, we propose adaptive mode switching algorithm. HMIPv6 is employed for IP connectivity and mobility service in WLAN, which solves some shortcomings, such as high handoff overhead and vulnerable security from MIPv6. For routing in MANET, OLSR is employed, which operates with current IP protocol compatibly with no change or modification. The proposed internetworking scheme based on adaptive mode switching algorithm shows better performance than scheme from [1]. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006."
1369,Supporting reconfigurable security policies for mobile programs,"Programming models that support code migration have gained prominence, mainly due to a widespread shift from stand-alone to distributed applications. Although appealing in terms of system design and extensibility, mobile programs are a security risk and require strong access control. Further, the mobile code environment is fluid, i.e. the programs and resources located on a host many change rapidly, necessitating an extensible security model. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a security infrastructure. The model is built around an event/response mechanism, in which a response is executed when a security-related event occurs. We support a fine-grained, conditional access control language, and enforce policies by instrumenting the bytecode of protected classes. This method enhances efficiency and promotes separation of concerns between security policy and program specification. This infrastructure also allows security policies to change at runtime, adapting to varying system state, intrusion, and other events."
1388,Identity-based revocation system: Enhanced security model and scalable bounded IBRS construction with short parameters,"Identity-based revocation system (IBRS) produces a ciphertext based on the revoked identities such that this ciphertext can only be decrypted by the private keys of non-revoked identities. IBRS can be classified into unbounded IBRS and bounded IBRS, depending on whether to set a maximal revocation number (e.g., N) or not. Compared to unbounded IBRS, existing bounded IBRS schemes have the advantage of short ciphertexts, however, they cannot support an increase of N and have to fix a large N to provide the revocation. This compromises the computational efficiency, which is linear in N. To bridge this gap, we are interested in exploring whether N can be dynamic. Precisely, N is initially set as a small number and increased into a larger one when more than N identities are revoked, while this increase does not affect other non-revoked users in the system. In this paper, motivated by the security of bounded IBRS with a dynamic N, we define an enhanced security model, which allows the corruption of any polynomial number (e.g., n) of private keys, independent of N. It augments existing security models by running different challenges when n N, respectively. The enhanced security model suits both unbounded 1BRS and bounded IBRS with a general description that can be ``empty'' for unbounded IBRS or a special N for bounded IBRS. Then, we propose a scalable bounded IBRS scheme and are able to prove its security in an enhanced security model. The increase of N incurs no changing on all of the existing private keys and the only cost is a slight expansion of the master public keys. Our proposed scheme also has short ciphertexts and private keys, comparable to the state-of-the-art (bounded) IBRS schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
1397,Light-Weight Hidden Markov Trust Evaluation Model for IoT network,"The open-ended nature of the Internet of Things (IoT) had whipped them vulnerable to a variety of attacks, therefore the need of securing and stabilizing the network while keeping the integrity intact has become the most prominent requirement. Traditionally cryptographic methods were employed to secure networks but the demand of undesirable code size and processing time had given rise to trust-based schemes for addressing the misbehavior of attacks in the IoT networks. With reference to it, several trust-based schemes have been proposed by researchers. However, the prevailing schemes require high computational power and memory space; which weakens the network integrity and control. In this context, the paper presents a Light-weight Hidden Markov Model (L/W- HMT) for trust evaluation to alleviate the effect of compromised nodes and restricts the storage of unnecessary data to reduce overhead, memory, and energy consumption. This research work has presented a 2state HMM with Trusted state and compromised state together with essential and unessential output as observation state. Amount of packets forwarded, dropped, modified, and received are the parameters for state transition and emission matrices while the forward likelihood function evaluates the trust value of the node. Simulation performed on MATLAB indicates that the intended L/W-HMT scheme outperforms in connection with detection rate, packet delivery rate and energy consumption, on an average by 6%, 8% and 70% respectively when compared to the similar OADM trust model."
1404,Taxonomy of Cyber Threats,"Cyber threats span the attack cycle, and include both offensive and defensive elements. Several conceptual models help with describing the attack process and associated entities, in developing a taxonomy of cyber threats. For Example, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) helps to describe a system to manage cyber security risk. In addition, the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) and the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) are used to standardize indicator information into a form that will make the data sharable. This helps to structure the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) information in order to use it in defensive approaches (e.g., DREAD: damage/reproducibility/exploitability/affected users/discoverability; STRIDE: spoofing/tampering/repudiation/information disclosure/denial of service/elevation of privilege; CVSS: Common Vulnerability Scoring System) along with more advanced approaches that emulate offensive steps. Sharing cyber data is performed by government agencies (e.g., US Department of Homeland Security) along with information analysis centers (e.g., Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center [MS-ISAC]). In addition to managing known threat data across an attack process, threat evaluation is performed via methodological evaluation of system-level vulnerabilities using model/architecture descriptions (e.g., system modeling language [SysML]) and rolling up developing threat descriptions through techniques like the US Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Analytics Repository (DoDCAR)."
1410,Providing adaptive quality of security in quantum networks,"Recently, several Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks, such as Tokyo QKD, SECOQC, have been built to evaluate the quantum based OTP(One Time Pad) secure communication. As an ideal unconditional secure technique, OTP requires the key rate the same as the information rate. However, comparing with high speed information traffic (Gbps), the key generation rate of QKD is very poor(Kbps). Therefore, in practical QKD networks, it is difficult to support numerous applications and multiple users simultaneously. To address this issue, we argue that it is more practical to provide quality of security instead of OTP in quantum networks. We further propose ASM, an Adaptive Security Selection Mechanism for quantum networks based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). In ASM, services can select an appropriate encryption algorithm that satisfies the proper security level and performance metrics under the limit of the key generation rate. We also implement ASM under our RT-QKD platform, and evaluate its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ASM can select the optimal algorithm to meet the requirement of security and performance under an acceptable cost."
1420,Composite Risk Modeling for Automated Threat Mitigation in Medical Devices,"Medical device security is a growing concern with increasing incorporation of complex software and hardware. Security threats exploiting vulnerabilities in medical devices may directly impact patient safety. Standardization and federal organizations are hence, actively involved in setting up new paradigms for guidance and regulation of security throughout the lifecycle. To protect medical devices against threats a risk-based framework that continually manages and assesses security risks along with their proactive addressing is highly recommended. In this paper, we model a multi-modal design approach for risk assessment in medical devices and propose an adaptive remediation scheme to mitigate security threats. Our multi-modal approach is integrated into the hardware-software development with a middleware for interaction between the modes. This provides an effective premarket risk management while the adaptive remediation scheme pro-actively mitigate risk during postmarket deployment. We model our approaches in detail and demonstrate them in a pacemaker design model and deployment scenario."
1452,Concepts for the improvement of supply chain efficiency and security,"Modern supply chains have a large number of transport phases and actors involved, and face many security risks. This paper presents a discussion and new concepts for management of the multimodal supply chains and transport unit security. The paper will assess how companies can benefit from the investments in security technology, and discuss the possibilities of the use of monitoring technology."
1464,The architecture design for content-aware network security services,"With the ongoing increase of the network technologies' diversity and the integration of the user level applications, the legacy-style content-independent configuration of the security mechanisms cannot yields in efficient security solutions farther. Our work aims to contribute on the design of auto-reconfigurable (adaptive) security services that are capable to satisfy the application's security level required with minimal network resources' usage. In this paper we propose a new networkcentric security architecture design that relies on the current network security conditions and content-aware mechanisms. The architecture main functional blocks and the corresponding relationships are defined. This architecture shall supply three inter-domain composite user security services, named ""public traffic"", ""secret content"" and ""private communication"", as well as, attack source traceback and distributed access control functionalities."
1486,Security takes integrated turn,"RSA Conference is focusing on integrated approach to provide intrusion prevention and detection. Hardware specialists are proposing centralized access-policy approaches for providing security. Corporate users and institutions serving customers are trying to combine together seven-layer security systems, which includes elements of crypto, identity management, and authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA). Industry consolidation can solve part of the security proliferation problem. Besides integrating dissimilar access- and network-control products, network equipment OEMs and operating system specialists will be best positioned to establish security frameworks because control must be embedded in the network infrastructure. In addition to this, appliance-based strategies must adopt to dynamic, adaptive security systems that focus on the data being protected."
1503,A farewell to firewalls?,"Web services were designed to provide programmatic access to Web applications, and open a path for client applications to receive and execute remote code. Web services became the next frontier in network programming, intended from the start to tunnel through firewalls using HTTP and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Thus, the advent of Web services made firewalls less effective."
1505,Integrated Architecture for Embedded Control-Command,"This paper presents a low-cost approach that allows distributed control/command architectures to be used for industrial systems. The goal of this project is to be able to run the systems thanks to simulation software, which can be replaced by the real parts as soon as they are built. This generic software can be used in the simulation and evaluation mode and also in the final operational mode. Our approach can be summarized by the following three key points: A distributed architecture of smart sensors and actuators, which are binded by a dedicated data network (CAN fieldbus). An embedded version of Linux, which acts as an an ethernet gateway is developed and allows the supervision of a remote control points. The connections of new elements are simplified thanks to a classification of sensors and actuators. When new machine or systems are developed with requirements such as flexibility and real time constraints we chose an open architecture divided in two stages to ensure optimal data transmission security. The low-level activity is ensured by a priority-based fieldbus to connect hardware devices through low cost micro-controllers. The second level interface collects data flow and transfers control from the ethernet supervisor. This interface runs on an embedded PC under Linux operating system (OS). With such an open OS, a very compact and evaluative code has been produced. A first demonstration model was developed in collaboration with the astrophysical Labs and Observatory of Grenoble. This model has allowed a validation of the proposed architecture for an experimental astrophysical instrument. It is noteworthy that such an architecture can be used in other systems such as those used in the area of digital printing."
1506,Security of current mobile IP solutions,"Due to the operation of IP' s addressing and routing algorithms, mobile nodes (such as notebooks, portable workstations and palmtop computers) cannot currently participate, while roaming without being reconfigured, in tactical wired and wireless networks, strategic networks or the Internet. A node's IP address encodes the network access point to which the node is connected. This prevents IP packets from reaching the node if it moves to a new location and tries to connect to its home network from within a different network. Changing the IP address of a node when it moves is not possible while keeping existing transport level connections open. This change requires the termination of all current network activity and the user making a number of configuration changes followed by rebooting of the Node. There are a number of proposed solutions for supporting mobile nodes (leading approaches are: Mobility Support in IPv4 [Perkins96-1], Route Optimized Mobile IP for IPv4 [Johnson96-1], and Mobility Support in IPv6 [Johnson96-2]) that are compatible with the TCP/IP protocol suite. This paper addresses the security needs for IP mobile hosts in the tactical battlefield, the security capabilities and deficiencies of these solutions, and proposed solutions for identified security deficiencies."
1519,MAST - A mobile agent-based security tool,"One of the chief computer security problems is not the long list of viruses and other potential vulnerabilities, but the vast number of systems that continue to be easy prey, as their system administrators or owners simply aren't able to keep up with all of the available patches, updates, or needed configuration changes in order to protect them from those known vulnerabilities. Even up-to-date systems could become vulnerable to attacks, due to inappropriate configuration or combined used of applications and services. Our mobile agent-based security tool (MAST) is designed to bridge this gap, and provide automated methods to make sure that all of the systems in a specific domain or network are secured and up-to-date with all patches and updates. The tool is also designed to check systems for misconfigurations that make them vulnerable. Additionally, this user interface is presented in a domain knowledge model known as a Concept Map that provides a continuous teaming experience for the system administrator."
