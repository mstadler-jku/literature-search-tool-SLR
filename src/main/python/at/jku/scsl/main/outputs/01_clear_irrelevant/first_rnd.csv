57,58,Static Vulnerabilities Detection Based on Extended Vulnerability State Machine Model,B. Liang,10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.10,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4908466,2009.0,IEEE Conferences,"A static vulnerability detection method based on an extended vulnerability state machine is proposed in this paper. In this method, the state space of state machine model is extended. The security state of a variable can be identified by a property set that may consist of multiple security-related properties rather than a single property. As results, fine-grained state transition is provided to support accurate recognition of program security-related behaviors. Specially, the recognition of validation checking is introduced to reduce false positives. Besides, a systematic discrimination mechanism for tainted data is constructed to prevent false negatives result from neglecting tainted data sources. The experimental results of a prototype system show that this method can effectively detect vulnerabilities in software systems with obviously lower false positive than existing methods, and avoid some serious false negative.",IEEE Xplore,"2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted Computing"

With the relationship of security to the threshold, the time period and the intrusion rate, an evaluation of security is obtained.

Katre,10.1109/ISS1.2017.8389459,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8389459,2017.0,IEEE Conferences,"Blockchain and Internet of things are the most promising and upcoming technologies. Blockchain is a distributed, peer to peer database forming a chain between multiple blocks of data. The internet of things works on a similar paradigm where multiple devices are connected to the internet forming a network of networks. Combined together they offer solutions for various problems, especially in the field of healthcare where quick reporting of data or results is of utmost importance. Recent studies have proven that delays in providing healthcare are directly linked to patient confidence and chances of recovery. An unreliable storage of health records has only aggravated the problem. Our paper aims to provide a solution for these issues by proposing a Blockchain-Internet of things model where a bio-sensor measures and collects real time data with respect to a patient's medical status and stores it in the blockchain. In this way quick reporting and tamper proof storage of data occurs. By deploying a smart contract the final hospital bill can be calculated along with insurance coverage. This would negate the need of third party providers and create a transparent system. Our paper also proposes the use of Inter planetary file system to store discharged patients records thus reducing the load on the actual blockchain. Overall this will surely benefit patients and doctors alike by creating a safe and transparent environment along with quick response to a patient's need.",IEEE Xplore,2017 International Conference on Intelligent Sustainable Systems (ICISS)

Existing studies about the security of SDN-enabled smart grid (SDSG) mainly focused on static methods such as access control and identity authentication, which is vulnerable to attackers that carefully probe the system. As the attacks become more variable and complex, there is an urgent need for dynamic defense methods. In this paper, we propose a security function virtualization (SFV) based moving target defense of SDSG which makes the attack surface constantly changing. First, we design a dynamic defense mechanism by migrating virtual security function (VSF) instances as the traffic state changes. The centralized SDN controller is re-designed for global status monitoring and migration management. Moreover, we formalize the VSF instances migration problem as an integer nonlinear programming problem with multiple constraints and design a pre-migration algorithm to prevent VSF instances' resources from being exhausted. Simulation results indicate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.",IEEE Xplore,ICC 2019 - 2019 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)

Al-Anbuky,10.1109/Trustcom.2015.362,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345270,2015.0,IEEE Conferences,"Due to the nature of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in open-access and error-prone wireless environments, the security issues are always crucial. The traditional security mechanisms such as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is no longer as feasible in protecting WSN as in wired networks. The new concept of trust has emerged in recent studies as an alternative mechanism to address the security concerns in WSNs. Most recent studies on trust are mainly focused on how to model and evaluate trust so as to effectively detect, isolate, and avoid any malicious activity in the network. In this paper, we have introduced the new angle of adaptive network approach to study 'dynamics on networks' i.e., trust state transition on a network with a fixed topology or 'dynamics of networks' i.e., topological transformation of a network with no dynamic trust state changes separately so as to discover the interplay between network overlay entities' trust evaluation and its underlie topological connectivity. Inspired from the trust studies in sociology, we propose that the Simmelian tie structured networks enable more positive impact on fostering trustworthiness among sensor nodes, while structural hole characterized networks provide more opportunity for misbehaviors and have negative impact to secure WSNs. These hypothesis have been confirmed by the extensive simulation studies.",IEEE Xplore,2015 IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA
356,357,Secrecy Outage Performance for DF Buffer-Aided Relaying Networks With a Multi-Antenna Destination,C. Wei; W. Yang; Y. Cai; X. Tang; G. Kang,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907781,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8676270,2019.0,IEEE Journals,"In this paper, we investigate the secrecy outage performance of decode-and-forward (DF) buffer-aided relaying networks with a multi-antenna destination in the presence of an eavesdropper. In order to take full advantage of the benefits provided by the multiple antennas at the destination and the available relays, we adopt the max-link relay selection scheme and propose a half-duplex and two full-duplex secure transmission schemes for secrecy improvement, i.e., 1) maximal-ratio combining (MRC), 2) maximal-ratio combining/cooperative jamming (MRC/CJ), and 3) zero-forcing beamforming/cooperative jamming (ZFB/CJ). For all proposed schemes, we present exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability by modeling the dynamic buffer state transitions as a Markov chain. Moreover, simple and informative asymptotic results are provided under both L → ∞ and L → ∞ scenarios (where L denotes the buffer size), from which we can obtain further insights on the secrecy diversity gain and the secrecy coding gain. The highlights of this paper can be summarized as follows: 1) Under L → ∞ scenario, the secrecy diversity gains of all proposed schemes both reach M. When L → ∞, the secrecy diversity gains of MRC, MRC/CJ and ZFB/CJ increase to M (1 + ND), MND and 2M respectively, where M is the number of relays and ND represents the number of antennas at the destination; 2) The secrecy coding gain of the system differs with different schemes, and it improves with the increase of M and ND under both the two scenarios; and 3) Under the scenario L → ∞, ZFB/CJ outperforms MRC and MRC/CJ across the entire signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range of interest, however, when L→ ∞, ZFB/CJ outperforms MRC/CJ and MRC in the low SNR regime, while the opposite holds in the high SNR regime.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Access

Shamma,10.1109/CDC.2015.7402927,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7402927,2015.0,IEEE Conferences,"In asymmetric information zero-sum games, one player has superior information about the game over the other. Asymmetric information games are particularly relevant for security problems, e.g., where an attacker knows its own skill set or alternatively a system administrator knows the state of its resources. In such settings, the informed player is faced with the tradeoff of exploiting its superior information at the cost of revealing its superior information. This tradeoff is typically addressed through randomization, in an effort to keep the uninformed player informationally off balance. A lingering issue is the explicit computation of such strategies. This paper, building on prior work for repeated games, presents an LP formulation to compute suboptimal strategies for the informed player in discounted asymmetric information stochastic games in which state transitions are not affected by the uninformed player. Furthermore, the paper presents bounds between the security level guaranteed by the sub-optimal strategy and the optimal value. The results are illustrated on a stochastic intrusion detection problem.",IEEE Xplore,2015 54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)

Users can access application servers in MEC instead of routing to the internet by passing through a core cellular network. Few security challenges arise as the traffic does not traverse through the core network, and these can be solved by providing authentication services in the MEC. However, authentication and application mobility issues arise in the case of multiple MECs where a user is mobile and needs continuous service from application servers, without needing to establish a new session and providing authentication information repeatedly to every new MEC it connects with. We propose two solutions, namely TC3A (Token-based Cookie transfer & 3rd-party Authentication) and TS3A (Token-based State transfer & 3rd-party Authentication) for resolution of authentication and application mobility issues while achieving low latency. Experiments were conducted on a testbed which emulated the handover of a user between two MECs. The results show that TC3A and TS3A provide authentication to users at reduced latency by 4.6% and 25%, respectively, as compared to simple login method, and most importantly application service continuity.",IEEE Xplore,2020 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)

The proposed optimization approach strives to adapt the security measures to the trust level on the nodes on the path and factors in the security-related overhead in the link cost. In addition, a novel path rotation scheme is proposed to enable the use of resource-efficient security measures without risking an increase in vulnerability.

With the development of the Internet, it is essential to effectively extract the relation between financial entities from internet financial intelligence and build a financial security knowledge graph, which lays the foundation for monitoring of internet security of finance. For relation extraction of Chinese internet financial intelligence, the existing models are all based on single-modal text semantics ignoring the role of Chinese pictographic semantics, while the shape and structure of Chinese characters contains useful semantics. In addition, the pictographic semantic fusion method of Chinese text also needs to be improved for better performance. To solve these shortcomings, we propose a Chinese Multimodal Relation Extraction model (CMRE), which improves the relation extraction ability on the Chinese internet financial intelligence. In CMRE, we extract pictographic semantics based on Chinese character shape and structure. Furthermore, we design a novel multi-modal semantic fusion module based on improved Transformer to effectively fuse the text and pictographic semantics. Additionally, we design experiments on the Chinese literature dataset(Sanwen) to test the relation extraction capability of CMRE.

Secure remote management allows more outsourcing to third parties but leads to continuously changing factory networks. Mobile or even autonomous devices again add complexity. However, current factory owners are conservative for good reasons: changing a well-designed system is costly and may cause failures and outages of the production lines. The virtual tenant network (VTN) concept addresses this conflict by means of combining network virtualization, hardware virtualization, cloud technologies and IT automation. Thus, tenants are isolated and configuration changes or security breaches in one tenant will not affect others.

Efficient healthcare is thus highly dependent on doctors being provided with access to patients' medical information at the right time and place. However it frequently happens that critical pieces of pertinent information end up not being used because they are located in information systems that do not inter-operate in a timely manner. Unfortunately the standard operational mode for many healthcare applications, and even healthcare institutions, is to be managed and operated as isolated islands that do not share information in an efficient manner. There are many reasons that contribute to this grim state of affairs, but what interests us the most is the lack of enforceable security policies for systems interoperability and data exchange and the existence of many heterogeneous legacy systems that are almost impossible to directly include into any reasonable secure interoperable workflow. In this paper we propose a RBAC mobile agent access control model supported by a specially managed public key infrastructure for mobile agent's strong authentication and access control. Our aim is to create the right means for doctors to be provided with timely accurate information, which would be otherwise inaccessible, by the means of strongly authenticated mobile agents capable of securely bridging otherwise isolated institutional eHealth domains and legacy applications.",IEEE Xplore,Proceedings of the 26th IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems
950,951,The importance of trust in a Layered Sensing construct,M. Nowak,10.1109/CTS.2010.5478463,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5478463,2010.0,IEEE Conferences,"The technological advances of the information age have created both an opportunity and a challenge for military decision makers. At first glance, the variety of data gathered by a multitude of traditional and non-traditional Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors should allow decision makers to better understand their environment and the threat. However, a number of factors tend to erode this advantage. Incompatible data formats, bandwidth limitations, sensor persistence and revisit rates, and multi-level security issues are but a few of the technical challenges that preclude end users from being able to take full advantage of the sensor information. Further, as the amount of sensor data increases, real challenges emerge in identifying the most salient pieces of information, fusing that with other relevant sensor modalities, and rapidly moving this information in a presentation format that does not overwhelm the decision maker. It was this problem space of improving information understanding to increase the situational awareness of decision makers that spawned the Layered Sensing vision. Layered Sensing has grown from an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate initiative into an AFRL effort that seeks to bring fused, multi-source, multi-spectral, multi-dimensional (e.g. cultural, environmental, etc.) information to decision makers consistent with their needs, regardless of their location. The end goal of Layered Sensing is to improve the situational awareness of decision makers by providing them with tailored sensor information. In essence, Layered Sensing is a Sensing Oriented Architecture where the customer can provide or request information tailored to their needs in order to facilitate situational awareness. The benefits of Layered Sensing extend beyond military application. For example, the Department of Homeland Security is one federal agency that could potentially face many of the same information challenge in operations as diverse as providing a common operating picture during a post-Katrina type reconstitution scenario or in fusing multi-source and multi-mode data (e.g. HUMINT, electronic intercepts, etc) in order to track or capture a suspected terrorist. Regardless of who implements a Layered Sensing architecture, the critical attribute of “trust” will have to be addressed - trusted information, trusted communication and trusted sensors. Trust is the sine qua non for any Layered Sensing implementation as it is difficult, if not impossible, to build situational awareness upon inaccurate, misleading, or maliciously modified information. The challenge of instilling and measuring trust in a system has many components. At the sensor node the issue of trust is one of ensuring the sensor works as intended and has not been compromised or co-opted. Between sensors, communications paths must be reliable, secure, and robust enough to recover from equipment degradation or malfunctions. Ideally, the local and global architecture should be autonomic with the ability to optimize sensor and communication performance. Finally, there needs to be a means to measure and portray the overall architecture trust picture status to those who are using it. The use of commercial off-the-shelf equipment, while cost effective, introduces its own trust issues due to uncontrollable supply chains. Relying solely on components from trusted sources is not feasible either economically or practically. As Layered Sensing moves from local architectures supporting an urban scenario to a global scenario the issue of complexity will arise. Seamlessly integrating a large number of spatially and temporally distributed heterogeneous sensors will require effective means to authenticate the new arrivals. Dynamic bandwidth allocation to account for optimal data transmission will also be important. Encompassing all of these trust issues is a way to measure and portray a “trust picture” to users. Instinctively, decision makers weigh the accuracy of data they receive based on their experiences with those data sources. For example, live-feed imagery will likely carry more weight in forming the user's situational awareness of a battle space rather than dated intelligence reports or HUMINT. For sensor derived information, the measure of trust of data is a function of the sensor, the environment it's operating in, the networks transmitting that data, and the fusion engine used to correlate the information. It's important these metrics of trust be available to the decision maker particularly if he/she is predisposed to rely on certain sensors/information sources over others. This conference represents the third time papers and studies have been presented that address the challenges associated with Layered Sensing. The purpose of this presentation is to provide a lead-in that introduces the concepts of Layered Sensing and lays the groundwork for subsequent session papers focused on the various aspects of trust.",IEEE Xplore,2010 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems

To this end, this paper establishes a machine learning model for STVS analysis and proposes a data-driven STVS constrained reactive power optimization method. A simplification for STVS constraints is proposed to reduce the difficulty of solving the optimization problem. The proposed model is tested based on the IEEE-39 model.

The modeling and analysis process is carried out using the Prototype Verification System (PVS), and is further facilitated by structuring the specification of the device using a format that is designed to be generic across interactive systems.

However, the issue of attack strength did not get enough attention so that most existing resilient WADCs may fail to defend strong attacks. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multiple-controller switching approach based resilient wide-area damping controller (MCS-RWADC) to suppress inter-area oscillations and mitigate strong attacks. It is inclusive of multiple secure networked prediction control based modules (SNPMs) and a switch-monitor module (MSM). The SNPM can detect attacks, differentiate attack strength and compensate for weak attacks. In terms of strong attacks, multiple SNPMs are implemented to work as backup and three operating states as well as the corresponding switching rules are designed to realize automatic switching among them. MSM is responsible for monitoring the states and directing the switching. Case studies are conducted on a 4-area 5-terminal voltage source converter-based multi-terminal high voltage direct current based offshore wind farm integration system. Simulation results verify MCS-RWADC cannot only suppress the inter-area oscillation but also handle the strong attacks under a wide range of operating conditions with various wind power output.",IEEE Xplore,IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid

Multimedia has become the biggest of big data as the foundation of today's data-driven discoveries. Almost all disciplines of science and engineering, as well as social sciences, involve multimedia data in some forms, such as recording experiments, driverless cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, smart communities, biomedical instruments, security surveillance. Some recent events demonstrate the power of real-time broadcast of unfolding events on social networks. Multimedia data is not just big in volume, but also multi-modal and mostly unstructured. Storing, indexing, searching, integrating, and recognizing from the vast amounts of data create unprecedented challenges. Even though significant progress has been made processing multimedia data, today's solutions are inadequate in handling data from millions of sources simultaneously. The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (IEEE-MIPR) aims to provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation, and applications of multimedia information processing and retrieval for single modality or multiple modalities. The target audiences are university researchers, scientists, industry practitioners, software engineers, and graduate students who want to become acquainted with technologies for big data analytics, machine intelligence, information fusion in multimedia information processing and retrieval.

Nonetheless, administration of attributes is not well-studied so far. Recently, the Generalized User-Role Assignment model (GURA) was proposed to provide ARBAC97-style (administrative role-based access control) administration of user attributes. An attribute is simply a name-value pair, examples of which include clearance, group and affiliations. In GURA, user attributes are collectively administered by different administrative roles to enable distributed administration. Given an administrative policy that specifies the conditions under which administrative roles can modify user attributes, it is useful to understand whether an attribute of a particular user can reach a specific value because user attributes are used for security-sensitive activities such as authentication, authorization and audit. In this paper, we study the user-attribute reachability problems in a restricted GURA model called rGURA. We formalize rGURA as a state transition system and show that the reachability problems for its general cases are PSPACE-complete. However, we do find polynomial-time solutions to reachability problems for limited versions of rGURA that are still useful in practice. The algorithms not only answer reachability problem but also provide a plan of sequential attribute updates by one or more administrators in order to reach particular values for user attributes. rGURA is relatively simple and practical. It is likely that other proposals will subsume the functionality of rGURA and thereby subsume its complexity results.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 2013 ACM Workshop on Digital Identity Management

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional per character state processing and state transition detection paradigm. The main focus of existing schemes is in optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of reduced number of operations and states using out-of-sequence detection methods have not been explored. In this paper, we propose Looka-head Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection using very small amount of memory. LaFA's memory requirement is very small due to the following three areas of effort described in this paper: (1) Different parts of a RegEx, namely RegEx components, are detected using different detectors, each of which is specialized and optimized for the detection of a certain RegEx component. (2) We systematically reorder the RegEx component detection sequence, which provides us with new possibilities for memory optimization. (3) Many redundant states in classical finite automata are identified and eliminated in LaFA. Our simulations show that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. A single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Based on the throughput of our LaFA prototype on FPGA, we estimated that a 34-Gbps throughput can be achieved.",ACM Digital Library,Proceedings of the 5th ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems

The larger the value of SNR, the better the audio quality of the embedded information, and the smaller the value of BER, the more resistant the embedded information is to malicious attacks. This study first considers the unknown coefficients in the discrete wavelet transform and the unknown weights of these coefficients, as well as the state-switching embedded equations in an optimization model to embed digital information or private message. Next, Karush–Kuhn–Tucker theorem and minimum-energy approach play two essential roles to determine the unknown coefficients and the unknown weights so as to complete the information embedding or private message communication. In addition, the extraction of private message is similar to the private message embedding reversely. Finally, this study obtains an essential optimization-based system with state switching for embedding digital information or private message into an audio signal.

The objective of low latency detection is to minimize detection delay while ensuring high detection accuracy. This is different from conventional detection methods that focus mainly on detection accuracy and pay little attention to detection delay. A lower detection delay can reduce recovery time, thus minimizing service interruption or economic losses due to cyberattacks. Since detection delay is the main design metric, the algorithm is developed by using a non-linear dynamic AC system model with an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to capture power grid state transitions in real-time, while many other works in the literature use a simplified linear DC model. The DRL detection algorithm is developed by using a continuous state space deep Q-network (DQN) on the framework of a Markov decision process (MDP). The new DQN design has two main innovations. First, the MDP state is designed as a sliding window of Rao-statistics of the AC dynamic state estimation residues. The proposed state formulation can accurately capture dynamic power state transitions in real-time. Second, a new reward function is designed to allow a flexible trade-off between detection delays and detection accuracy. The delay-accuracy trade-off can be adjusted by tuning a single parameter in the reward function. Simulation results show that the proposed DQN-based DRL detection algorithm can achieve very low detection delays with high detection accuracy. © 2022",Scopus,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems

This study was to determine whether or not it is possible to achieve a viable experimental model, taking into account the existing facilities in INDMTM and SC MDM STANDARD SRL. The proposed drone was an Undetectable Marine Drone powered with Magnetohydrodynamic Engine controlled by Artificial Intelligence. The drone will have two operating modes, floating and submersible.

In order to avoid both sonar type detectors (passive mode and active mode) the drone must not make any sound (to avoid passive sonar detection) and it must be capable to emulate a movement similar to that of a marine creature, usually fish (to avoid active sonar detection).

A significant corpus of work has so far focused on aggregated behavior, e.g., considering traffic volumes observed over a given time interval. Very limited attempts can instead be found tackling prediction at packet-level granularity. This much harder problem (whose solution extends trivially to the aggregated prediction) allows a finer-grained knowledge and wider possibilities of exploitation. The recent investigation and success of sophisticated Deep Learning algorithms is now providing mature tools to face this challenging but promising goal. In this work, we investigate and specialize a set of architectures selected among Convolutional, Recurrent, and Composite Neural Networks, to predict mobile-app traffic at the finest (packet-level) granularity. We discuss and experimentally evaluate the prediction effectiveness of the provided approaches also assessing the benefits of a number of design choices such as memory size or multi-modality, investigating performance trends at packet level focusing on the head and the tail of biflows.

Eight different modes of operation can be selected based on the map graph (concave or convex), the range modification procedure (shrinking or widening) and the sign of one of its independent parameters. The generalization and modification preserve the controllability and continuous chaotic behavior properties, respectively. For the same encryption key and map equation, multi-mode operation occurs through switching between four alternatives of the dependent parameters. Switching between various modes is shown to overpass single modes in randomness by investigating the frequency distribution, autocorrelation function, histograms and 0-1 test. In addition, most bits, 75%, of the scaled and quantized chaotic output are shown to be suitable for pseudo-random number generation based on National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) statistical test suite. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated for several speech, grayscale and RGB images through various evaluation criteria, where good results are achieved. These criteria include basic perceptual and statistical aspects, the more advanced NIST tests, key sensitivity and robustness against brute force and differential attacks. The efficiency of the scheme is improved by up to three or six times faster than encrypting one sample or one channel of a pixel at a time for speech and image inputs, respectively.

Accordingly, three essential algorithms for biometric authentication are presented. The extracted features from these multimodals are combined via feature fusion center (FFC) and feature scores. These features are trained through artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The first algorithm depends on boundary energy method (BEM) extracted features from fingerprint, normalized combinational features from iris and dimensionality reduction methods (DRM) from voice using sum/average FFC. The second proposed algorithm uses extracted features from zoning method of fingerprint, SIFT of iris and higher order statistics (HOS) of voice signals. The third proposed algorithm consists of extracted features from zoning method for fingerprint, SIFT from iris and DRM from voice signals. Classification accuracy of implemented algorithms is estimated. Comparison between proposed algorithms is introduced in terms of equal error rate (EER) and ROC curves. The experimental results confirm superiority of second proposed algorithm which achieves a classification rate of 100% using SVM classifier and sum FFC. From computational point of view, the first algorithm consumes the lowest time using SVM classifier. On other hand, the lowest EER is achieved by first proposed algorithm for extracted features from Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) method of DRM. Additionally, the lowest ROC curves are accomplished respectively for extracted features from multidimensional scaling (MDS), generated ARMA synthesis and Isomap features. Their accuracy is improved with SVM. Also, the sum FFC introduces efficient results compared to average FFC. These algorithms have the advantages of robustness and the strength of selecting unimodal, double and triple biometric authentication. The obtained results accomplish a remarkable accuracy for authentication and security within multi practical applications. © 2021 - IOS Press.

These connections go hand in hand with security vulnerabilities and potential threats to these devices. In regular IT systems, we typically provide updates to eliminate vulnerabilities. In industrial automation and control systems, especially in mass production, legacy systems are widespread and installing updates causes downtime. Availability is one of the top goals; stopping a machine in case of a cyber-security threat is often too expensive. But, system integrators and asset owners should not have to wait until product or component suppliers release appropriate updates. Due to safety and warranty requirements, developing and distributing updates can take a long time. In the meantime, attackers can pose threats by taking advantage of devices' known vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose the design of resilient systems based on multi-modal architectures with several operational modes. When vulnerabilities of systems become known, or when systems get even attacked at some point, mode switching can overcome the time between vulnerability disclosure or attack, and the availability of corresponding security patches. Therefore, system integrators and asset owners can actively protect themselves by implicitly or explicitly switching to modes with reduced attack surfaces and, thus, with limited ranges of activity for attackers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

In this work, images of palmprint and iris are chosen as the traits for performing multimodal recognition. From these images the Features from these images were extracted using Log-Gabor transform, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Distance measures such as Hamming distance, Chi-Square distance and Euclidean distance were employed for generating matching scores. A weighted sum score level fusion technique was applied for combining the scores generated from iris and palmprint images. The performance of the system was evaluated by plotting the Detection Error Trade off (DET) curves and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The proposed system proved that multimodal recognition performed best than unimodal with a recognition accuracy of 92.23% by employing HOG as the feature descriptor.

However, the application of multimodal systems to security-critical applications is limited mainly due to non-adaptiveness of these systems to the dynamic environment and inability to distinguish between spoofing attack and the noisy input image. In order to address these issues, a multimodal biometric system, which adaptively combines the scores from individual classifiers is proposed. For this, three modalities viz. face, finger, and iris are used to extract individual classifier scores. These classifier scores are adaptively fused considering that concurrent modalities are boosted and discordant modalities are suppressed. The conflicting belief among classifiers is resolved not only to achieve optimum fusion of classifier scores but also to cater dynamic environment. The proposed quality based score fusion also distinguish between spoofing attacks and noisy inputs as well. The performance of the proposed multimodal biometric system is experimentally validated using three chimeric multimodal databases. On an average, the proposed system achieves an accuracy of 99.5%, an EER of 0.5% and also outperforms state-of-the-art methods. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Scopus,Applied Intelligence

More often than not the searchers are being asked to obtain an image of the gamma sources that are shielded or otherwise inaccessible. They are constantly being tasked to localize a moving source in busy traffic. Commercially available gamma detection units and prototype Government-funded research products use complex techniques such as hybrid imaging processes (combination of traditional Compton imaging with coded aperture masks, for example, modified uniformly redundant array [MURA] patterns). Standalone radiation detection systems are increasingly capitalizing on multi-modal detection, emphasizing on data fusion, informatics, and novel signal/signature exploitations. At the request of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office, previously known as the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), a study committee from the American Physical Society has recommended that emphasis is kept on the ability to detect shielded special nuclear material with high sensitivity and reliability. Development of new and improved detection algorithms (e.g., principal component analysis, maximum-likelihood estimation algorithm, and others) has been encouraged. CWMD has been urged to focus on signature identification in its nuclear forensic portfolio. Newer materials like SrI3:Eu2+, LaBr3:Ce, CeBr3:Ca2+ with fast rise time and short decay time of gamma pulses, high intrinsic gamma sensitivity, high gamma energy resolution, and high-efficiency conversion of excitation energy to fluorescent radiation are constantly being sought to build gamma detectors. Neutron detection and associated activation analysis using a gamma ray detection system is highly encouraged. There is a constant demand for miniaturization of gamma radiation detection system for tactical usage in the field- the most sought-after device must be lightweight, easy to use, should be able to withstand harsh environmental conditions, long shelf life with commensurate long battery life, high sensitivity (with preferably high resolution), capable of creating flexible and configurable alarm conditions with directional sensitivity. This array of technical constraints demands stringent specifications on the readout electronics, data acquisition technologies, interoperability and interconnectivity of data output and strict quality assurance of the detection and measurement devices. In recent years the CWMD has developed a system called Intelligent Radiation Sensing System (IRSS) that harnesses the information gathered by ubiquitous radiation monitoring systems deployed by the state, local, and tribal law enforcement organizers [1]. The IRSS was created to better equip law enforcement entities to protect large cities from the threats and harmful effects of nuclear or radiological incidents and emergencies. The IRSS uses a breakthrough technology that networks a group of portable radiation detectors with improved detection, localization, and identification of potential radiological threat. The program created a robust, flexible network architecture along with advanced data fusion algorithms that combine information from many detectors. A study [2] published in the Journal of Materials Research summarized the basic requirements for materials to be used in development of scalable radiation detection systems that considered the critical material performance metrics of energy resolution (1% for semiconductors like CZT, <3% for scintillators like LaBr3:Ce at 662 keV primary gamma ray energy from 137Cs isotope), fast timing including high mobility of electrons and holes in the semiconductors and fast scintillation processes, high spatial resolution for imaging purposes, high intrinsic detection efficiency (requiring high density, high effective atomic number Zeff), high geometric efficiency achieved sometimes by occlusion processes, neutron detection efficiency and operational factors like cost, ease of use, use of peripheral equipment like thermomechanical engines to stabilize the detection systems. Exciting new research and development work utilizing effective data mining algorithms is being performed at universities, national laboratories, and commercial institutions in gamma ray detection technology. For example, gamma ray imaging techniques first used in space telescopes are being applied in modern security and health systems in a joint project between the University of Southampton and industrial partner Symetrica. The project aims to develop a new coded aperture imaging system that could inspire a new generation of ""stand-off""imaging systems. These systems would allow for remote inspection for radioactive materials. This review article intends to capture the synergy of international commercial collaborations exemplified by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA's) SIGMA program in which detector expertise originating from the United Kingdom (Kromek Group plc.) algorithm development and system modelling and analysis developed by United States national laboratories came together under the general guidance provided by a small commercial unit, Invincea Labs, in the area of network algorithm integration and development.  © 2020 COPYRIGHT SPIE.",Scopus,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering

This research paper proposed continuous authentication (CA) process using multimodal biometric traits considers finger and iris print images to various feature extraction process. At that point, features are extracted into optimal feature level fusion (FLF) process. The final feature vector is acquired by concatenating directional information and centre area features.

Although recent studies have explored the quantification of system resilience, there has been limited research aimed at understanding the role of multiple performance measures, spatiotemporal heterogeneities, and modeling uncertainties within the assessment of resilience and associated decision-making. Under real-world conditions, there is an increased burden on analysts for translating observed system data (including human and electronic sensor observations) into system performance estimates that may not be directly observable. This paper addresses these issues using a scenario-based risk modeling approach to understand: (1) resilience of complex systems, often in cases of hidden (not readily observable) measures of performance, (2) resilience sensitivity to modeling uncertainties in event and system characteristics, and (3) resilience sensitivity to the measurement of performance across multiple operational perspectives. The methods in this paper integrate uncertainty-driven risk and probabilistic modeling within a multi-state Markov-based approach. This study contributes to the state-of-the-art by developing methodologies for assessing community perceptions of infrastructure system resilience using observable factors and inferring possibly hidden performance measures for facilitating adaptive decision-support. The methods are demonstrated with hypothetical spatiotemporal data across multiple system performance dimensions. The analysis results are useful for infrastructure security analysts, system decision-makers, and the general public. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Scopus,Journal of Risk Research

In case of failure of a virtual machine, it is imperative to shift the processes running on this machine to another. This activity is known as live virtual machine migration and is classified under the major issues of research. Xia (2015) proposed a mathematical model to analyze this problem in which the work has been done in two phases. It is showing a state transition model system in which the M/M/1/K model has been utilized in phase1 to find the rejection probability of the jobs in the phase2. Each virtual machine is considered to have a buffer to store the incoming buffer. The major issue being discussed in this paper is the relation of the rejection probability of jobs with the changing size of the buffer. It actually provides an exhaustive analysis of three different queueing models, i.e., M/M/1/∞, M/M/∞, and M/M/1/K. The simulations are carried out in MATLAB, and the results are analyzed based on the rejection probability of the jobs. It is observed that with an increase in the request arrival rate, the rejection probability of jobs increases. However, with an increase in execution rate, the rejection probability of jobs decreases. If we change the model to M/M/∞, actually, the formulas of request rejection probability and job rejection probability got changed that resulted in a continuous decrease in values of rejection rate lines as compared to the values of the author. Hence, we can say that changing the queueing model is beneficial. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.",Scopus,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing

However, the extreme sparsity of user-App matrix and many newly emerging Apps create severe challenges, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. Besides, unlike traditional items, Apps have rights to access users’ personal resources (e.g., location, message and contact) which may lead to security risk or privacy leak. Thus, users’ choosing of Apps are influenced by not only their personal interests but also their privacy preferences. Moreover, user privacy preferences vary with App categories. In light of the above challenges, we propose a mobile sparse additive generative model (Mobi-SAGE) to recommend Apps by considering both user interests and category-aware user privacy preferences in this paper. To overcome the challenges from data sparsity and cold start, Mobi-SAGE exploits both textual and visual content associated with Apps to learn multi-view topics for user interest modeling. We collected a large-scale and real-world dataset from 360 App store - the biggest Android App platform in China, and conducted extensive experiments on it. The experimental results demonstrate that our Mobi-SAGE consistently and significantly outperforms the other existing state-of-the-art methods, which implies the importance of exploiting category-aware user privacy preferences and the multi-modal App content data on personalized App recommendation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Scopus,Knowledge-Based Systems

In particular, we focus on using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that arise from the user's brain activities and eye tracking which can capture spontaneous responses that are unfiltered by the conscious mind. We conduct human study experiments to capture the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for a group of 25 participants while performing several computerbased activities in different scenarios.

FSA are also widely used in network security [6], bioinformatics [4] to enable efficient pattern matching. Compute-centric architectures like CPUs and GPG-PUs perform poorly on automata processing due to ir-regular memory accesses and can process only few state transitions every cycle due to memory bandwidth limitations. On the other hand, memory-centric architectures such as the DRAM-based Micron Automata Processor (AP) [2] can process up to 48K state transitions in a single cycle due to massive bit-level parallelism and reduced data movement/instruction processing overheads. Micron Automata Processor: The Micron AP re-purposes DRAM columns to store FSM states and the row address to stream input symbols. It implements homogeneous non-deterministic finite state automata (NFA), where each state has incoming transitions only on one input symbol. Each state has a label, which is the one-hot encoding of the symbols it is required to match against. Each input symbol is processed in two phases: (1) state-match, where the states whose label matches the input symbol are determined and (2) state-transition, where each of the matched states activates their corresponding next states. We explore SRAM-based last-level caches (LLCs) as a substrate for automata processing that are faster and integrated on processor dies. Cache capacity: One immediate concern is whether caches can store large automata. Interestingly, we observe that AP sacrifices a huge fraction of die area to accommodate the routing matrix and other non-memory components required for automata processing and only has a packing density comparable to caches. Repurposing caches for automata processing: While the memory technology benefits of moving to SRAM are apparent, repurposing the 40-60% passive LLC die area for massively parallel automata computation comes with several challenges. Processing an input symbol every LLC access (∼20-30 cycles @ 4GHz), would lead to an operating frequency comparable to DRAM-based AP (∼200 MHz), negating the memory technology benefits. Increasing operating frequency further can be made possible only by architecting an (1) in-situ computation model which is cognizant of internal geometry of LLC slices, and (2) accelerating state-match (array read) and state-transition (switch+wire propagation delay) phases of symbol processing. Accelerating state-match: This is challenging because industrial LLC subarrays typically have 4-8 bitlines sharing a sense-amp. This means that only 1 out of 4-8 states stored can match every cycle leading to gross under-utilization and loss of parallelism. To solve this, we leverage sense-amp cycling techniques that exploit spatial locality of state-matches. Accelerating state-transition: Accelerating state-transition at low-area cost requires the design of a scalable interconnect that efficiently encodes and supports multiple state-transitions on the same cycle, often to the same destination state. We observe that a 8T SRAM memory array can be re-purposed to become a compact state-transition crossbar for automata supporting large fan-in for states. Scaling to large automata: Supporting all-to-all connectivity between states requires prohibitively large and slow switches. Large real-world automata are typically composed of several connected components, grouped into densely connected partitions with only few (8-16) interconnections between them. This motivated us to explore a hierarchical switch topology with local switches providing rich intra-partition connectivity and global switches providing sparse inter-partition connectivity. To this end, we also design a compiler that automates the mapping of states into SRAM arrays. We propose and evaluate two architectures and mapping policies, one optimized for performance and the other optimized for space, across a set of 20 diverse benchmarks from ANMLZoo [5] and Regex [1] suites. We also demonstrate acceleration of parsing activities in browser front-end as a case study where FSA computations are a bottleneck taking up to 40% of the loading time of web pages [3]. The performance optimized and space optimized designs provide a speedup of 15× and 9× over Micron's AP respectively. © 2017 IEEE.",Scopus,"Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques - Conference Proceedings, PACT"

One way that image fusion can be particularly useful is when fusing imagery data from multiple levels of focus. Different focus levels can create different visual qualities for different regions in the imagery, which can provide much more visual information to analysts when fused. Multi-focus image fusion would benefit a user through automation, which requires the evaluation of the fused images to determine whether they have properly fused the focused regions of each image. Many no-reference metrics, such as information theory based, image feature based and structural similarity-based have been developed to accomplish comparisons. However, it is hard to scale an accurate assessment of visual quality which requires the validation of these metrics for different types of applications. In order to do this, human perception based validation methods have been developed, particularly dealing with the use of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and the area under them (AUC). Our study uses these to analyze the effectiveness of no-reference image fusion metrics applied to multi-resolution fusion methods in order to determine which should be used when dealing with multi-focus data.

One challenge in such systems is proper adaptation to and interpretation of events in the sensing area of an individual node; another challenge is the integration of observations from individual nodes into a common semantic representation of the environment. We describe a novel hierarchical architecture framework called SENSE (smart embedded network of sensing entities)1 to meet these challenges. Combining multi-modal sensor information from audio and video modalities to gain relevant information about the sensed environment, each node recognizes a set of predefined behaviors and learns about usual behavior. Neighbor nodes exchange such information to confirm unusual observations and establish a global view. Deviations from “normality” are reported in a way understandable for human operators without special training. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.",Scopus,Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing

In this paper, an approach of dynamic Bayesian network with transfer probability estimation was developed to predict whether the goal of system call sequences is normal or not, with early-warnings being launched, so as to ensure that some appropriate countermeasures could be taken in advance. Since complete set of system call state transfer can hardly be built in real environments, the empirical results show that the newly emerging system call transfer would have great impact on the prediction performance if we straightly use dynamic Bayesian network without transfer probability estimation. Therefore, we estimate the probability of new state transfer to predict the goals of system call sequences together with those in conditional probability table (CPT). It surmounts the difficulties of manually selecting compensating parameters with dynamic Bayesian network approach [Feng L, Guan X, Guo S, Gao Y, Liu P. Predicting the intrusion intentions by observing system call sequences. Computers & Security 2004; 23/3: 241-252] and obviously makes our prediction model more applicable. The University of New Mexico (UNM) and KLINNS data sets were analyzed and the experimental results show that it performs very well for predicting the goals of system call sequences with high accuracy and furthermore dispenses with much more manual work for selecting compensating parameters. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The run-time power gating of individual channels in a router is one of attractive solutions to reduce the standby power of chip without affecting the on-chip communication. However, a state transition between sleep and active mode incurs the performance penalty, and turning a power switch on or off dissipates the overhead energy, which means a short-term sleep adversely increases the power consumption. In this paper, we propose a sleep control method based on look-ahead routing that detects the arrival of packets two hops ahead, so as to hide the wake-up delay and reduce the short-term sleeps of channels. Simulation results using real application traces show that the proposed method conceals the wake-up delay of less than five cycles, and more leakage power can be saved compared with the original naive method. ©2008 IEEE.",Scopus,"Proceedings of the Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference, ASP-DAC"

Therefore, an increasing number of exploits and malicious applications for Android are developed by attackers. Many Android applications have malicious or abnormal behaviour: stealing private information, subscribing to unwanted paid services, consuming a large amount of resources on the device and displaying unwanted advertisements. Students learning security need to understand the behaviour of such applications. In this paper, we propose an infrastructure for collecting information pertaining to application behaviour at runtime and exposing the malicious and atypical actions performed by Android applications. The purpose of this infrastructure is to provide a meaningful learning experience to students, as they study malicious applications. The infrastructure includes collectors at every level of the operating system and the behaviour information includes: the consumed resources (CPU, memory), the exchanged messages (SMSs, phone calls, packets), the state changes of the communication channels (WiFi, 3G, Bluetooth, NFC). Behaviour information is sent periodically from the collectors to a native application and can be visualised through a Graphical User Interface, directly on the mobile device. Students are allowed to select any process in the system and investigate its behaviour in real time. They also can extract the behaviour information from the mobile device in order to perform statistical analysis on the data. Students are able compare the collected data for legitimate and malicious/abnormal applications and identify the malicious behaviour patterns. These patterns can be used to discover new malware, that is not yet detected by commercial antivirus solutions.

Several conceptual models help with describing the attack process and associated entities, in developing a taxonomy of cyber threats. For Example, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) helps to describe a system to manage cyber security risk. In addition, the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) and the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) are used to standardize indicator information into a form that will make the data sharable. This helps to structure the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) information in order to use it in defensive approaches (e.g., DREAD: damage/reproducibility/exploitability/affected users/discoverability; STRIDE: spoofing/tampering/repudiation/information disclosure/denial of service/elevation of privilege; CVSS: Common Vulnerability Scoring System) along with more advanced approaches that emulate offensive steps. Sharing cyber data is performed by government agencies (e.g., US Department of Homeland Security) along with information analysis centers (e.g., Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center [MS-ISAC]). In addition to managing known threat data across an attack process, threat evaluation is performed via methodological evaluation of system-level vulnerabilities using model/architecture descriptions (e.g., system modeling language [SysML]) and rolling up developing threat descriptions through techniques like the US Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Analytics Repository (DoDCAR).",SpringerLink,An Introduction to Cyber Analysis and Targeting

It is a static jet pump which operates using driving force to draw steam and water by internal pressure being reduced by direct contact condensation of these two fluids. In addition, capability of SI as a heat exchanger with high heat-transfer is expected. The absence of a drive unit such as an external power supply and rotating machine is significant characteristic of SI, and it can be expected to suppress the cost of installation and maintenance. It is also possible to produce a discharge pressure higher than the inlet pressure. From these facts, SI is expected to be applied as a static safety system that can cool the reactor core even if power lose at the nuclear power plant. Although SI has been used for steam engines since long ago, the mechanism of its operation has not yet been clarified. Thus, elucidation of the mechanism of operation of SI is indispensable for introduction to a nuclear power plant. A one-dimensional analytical model which predicts the operating characteristics assuming full condensation and evaluated discharge pressure is constructed (Narabayashi et al., 1996). In addition, from detailed observation, it was confirmed by that there is a boundary of luminance in the diffuser section (Abe et al., 2012). This is considered as the boundary where the two-phase flow condenses. However, this phenomenon is not considered in the current analysis model. The aim of this research is to clarify the flow structure in the diffuser section of SI. For that purpose, the state of the diffuser section of the transparent SI test part was observed with a high-speed camera, and the pressure at each point in it was measured simultaneously. As a result of visualization, it was found that the flow behavior of the diffuser portion in the operating state is roughly divided into two. There is a boundary between these two areas, the position of which varies with backpressure. Furthermore, it was confirmed that a sudden change in pressure occurred in the vicinity of the position where the flow behavior changed by comparison with the pressure measurement result. From the above results, the internal flow structure in the SI diffuser section was discussed. © 2018-2019 by JSME",Scopus,"International Conference on Nuclear Engineering, Proceedings, ICONE"

In order for the biometric system to be more secure and to provide high performance accuracy, more than one form of biometrics are required. Hence, the need arise for multimodal biometrics using combinations of different biometric modalities. This paper introduces a multimodal biometric system (MMBS) based on fusion of whole dorsal hand geometry and fingerprints that acquires right and left (Rt/Lt) near-infra-red (NIR) dorsal hand geometry (HG) shape and (Rt/Lt) index and ring fingerprints (FP). Database of 100 volunteers were acquired using the designed prototype. The acquired images were found to have good quality for all features and patterns extraction to all modalities. HG features based on the hand shape anatomical landmarks were extracted. Robust and fast algorithms for FP minutia points feature extraction and matching were used. Feature vectors that belong to similar biometric traits were fused using feature fusion methodologies. Scores obtained from different biometric trait matchers were fused using the Min-Max transformation-based score fusion technique. Final normalized scores were merged using the sum of scores method to obtain a single decision about the personal identity based on multiple independent sources. High individuality of the fused traits and user acceptability of the designed system along with its experimental high performance biometric measures showed that this MMBS can be considered for med-high security levels biometric identification purposes.",Scopus,"World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology"

SecurePhone's primary aim is to realise a mobile phone prototype - the ""SecurePhone"" - in which biometrical authentication enables users to deal secure, dependable transactions over a mobile network. The SecurePhone is based on a commercial PDA-phone, supplemented with specific software modules and a customised SIM card. It integrates in a single environment a number of advanced features: access to cryptographic keys through strong multimodal biometric authentication; appending and verification of digital signatures; real-time exchange and interactive modification of (e-signed) documents and voice recordings. SecurePhone's ""biometric recogniser"" is based on original research. A fused combination of three different biometric methods - speaker, face and handwritten signature verification - is exploited, with no need for dedicated hardware components. The adoption of non-intrusive, psychologically neutral biometric techniques is expected to mitigate rejection problems that often inhibit the social use of biometrics, and speed up the spread of e-signature technology. Successful biometric authentication grants access to SecurePhone's built-in e-signature services through a user-friendly interface. Special emphasis is accorded to the definition of a trustworthy security chain model covering all aspects of system operation. © 2010.",Scopus,"SECRYPT 2006 - International Conference on Security and Cryptography, Proceedings"

In this prototype there exist multiple server processes, client processes, and one server manager process. According to the user request, a file server process is assigned to a client process and activated by the server manager process. A file server has various operational modes. This mode is determined by the server manager to meet various application requirements. And this process can also perform some functions for security enhancement. This mechanism helps network users to select any file server with its most efficient mode and ensure data integrity and security. This mechanism is combined with a high-level programming language provided by a client process, and therefore offers high serviceability.",Scopus,Quarterly Report of RTRI (Railway Technical Research Institute) (Japan)
4126,4127,Threshold Public-Key Encryption with Adaptive Security and Short Ciphertexts,"Qin B,Wu Q,Zhang L,Domingo-Ferrer J",,,2010,Conference Paper,"Threshold public-key encryption (TPKE) allows a set of users to decrypt a ciphertext if a given threshold of authorized users cooperate. Existing TPKE schemes suffer from either long ciphertexts with size linear in the number of authorized users or can only achieve non-adaptive security. A non-adaptive attacker is assumed to disclose her target attacking set of users even before the system parameters are published: The notion of non-adaptive security is too weak to capture the capacity of the attackers in the real world. In this paper, we bridge these gaps by proposing an efficient TPKE scheme with constant-size ciphertexts and adaptive security. Security is proven under the decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponentiation (BDHE) assumption in the standard model. This implies that our proposal preserves security even if the attacker adaptively corrupts all the users outside the authorized set and some users in the authorized set, provided that the number of corrupted users in the authorized set is less than a threshold. We also propose an efficient tradeoff between the key size and the ciphertext size, which gives the first TPKE scheme with adaptive security and sublinear-size public key, decryption keys and ciphertext.",Web of Science,INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY

Those security systems do not prevent effectively the more emergent types of attacks, like a botnet, whose presence and behavior is difficult to predict. In order to predominate those types of attacks, we advocate an adaptive security approach based on the animal immune system. But since those sophisticated attacks can also be directed at the security systems themselves, leading to computer immunodeficiency, like HIV, in this paper we propose a protocol that protects the immune system itself This approach discriminates between attacks on the security systems, which are part of the computer immune system, and attacks on other vital computer systems in an information infrastructure.",Web of Science,"PACIFIC ASIA CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS 2006, SECTIONS 1-8"

The fusion of hand-based biometrics such as palmprint and palmvein is straightforward since they can be acquired simultaneously with a customized image acquisition device. Conjugate 2DPalmHash Code (CTDPHC), which is constructed by 2DPalmHash Codes (2DPHCs) of palmprint and palmvein, is proposed as a cancelable multi-modal biometric. To determine the proper fusion strategy of 2DPHCs of palmprint and palmvein, different fusion rules at score level are compared and discussed. The transposition orientation ranges of 2DPHCs are also fine-tuned to improve the accuracy performance. Compared with 2DPHC, CTDPHC enjoys higher verification accuracy and stronger anti-counterfeit ability, while trades neither computational complexity nor storage cost.",Web of Science,"2013 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (CISP), VOLS 1-3"

An Internet enabled embedded programmable logic controller is used in the context of intelligent networked Heating, Ventilation, & Air Conditioning (HVAC)-control. In the paper, security problems of the ecotope, comprising embedded controllers, web servers, and external services are analysed. In the absence of encryption of the channels, an application based security method was designed, preventing from simple manipulation of user data. Integrity of the intranet is secured via rigorous design, avoiding inbound traffic. A simplified sequence diagram documents this primary protection process, using rolling code encryption of the transmitted data. The security method was demonstrated successfully using an IP enabled universal industrial controller. Apart from security, process capability is investigated, analysing energy supply, communication channel options, bandwidth and real time requirements.

Therefore, the prevention of such attacks is imperative. The hindrance of such attacks is exclusively dependent on their detection. The detection is a prime part of any security tool such as Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Adaptive Security Alliance (ASA), check points and firewalls. A variety of intrusion detection approaches be present to resolve this severe issue but the main problem is performance. Therefore, in this paper, a model is proposed to overcome performance issues. In this model, support vector machine (SVM) and backpropagation neural network are applied on distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks. The system uses sampled data form cooperative association for internet data analysis (CAIDA) dataset, an attack database that is a standard for evaluating the security detection mechanisms. The results and comparative studies indicate that the proposed mechanism demonstrate more accuracy in case of false positive, false negative and detection rate.",Web of Science,INFORMATION-AN INTERNATIONAL INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL

Despite overcoming the traditional verification problems, the unimodal systems suffer from various challenges like intra class variation, noise in the sensor data etc, affecting the system performance. These problems are effectively handled by the multimodal systems. In this paper, we present a multimodal approach for palm and finger prints by decision level fusion. The proposed multi-modal system is tested on a developed database consisting of 440 palm and finger prints each of 55 individuals. In methodology of decision level fusion, Directional energy based feature vectors of palm and finger print identifiers are compared with their respective databases to generate scores based upon which final decisions are made by the individual matcher which are combined through Bayesian decision fusion. Receiver Operating Characteristics curves are formed for the unimodal and multimodal systems. Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.7321% for decision level fusion shows that the multimodal systems significantly outperforms. unimodal palm and finger prints identifiers with EER of 2.822% and 2.553% respectively.",Web of Science,"2010 THE 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION (PACIIA2010), VOL III"

In this paper, we present a novel security model for global non-interference which approximates non-interference as a safety property. We also propose a certification technique for global non-interference of complete Java classes based on rewriting logic, a very general logical and semantic framework that is efficiently implemented in the high-level programming language Maude. Starting from an existing Java semantics specification written in Maude, we develop an extended, information-flow Java semantics that allows us to correctly observe global non-interference policies. In order to achieve a finite state transition system, we develop an abstract Java semantics that we use for secure and effective non-interference Java analysis. The analysis produces certificates that are independently checkable and are small enough to be used in practice.",Web of Science,FORMAL METHODS FOR COMPONENTS AND OBJECTS
