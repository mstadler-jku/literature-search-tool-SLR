1434,y,From CA-BRS to BPMN: Formal Approach for Modeling Adaptive Security in Cyber-Physical Systems,"Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) are emerging systems that offer integrations of computation, networking and physical processes. Recently, the CPS field has been identified as a key area of research, and CPSs are expected to play a major role in the design and development of future systems. However, the mutual coordination and inter-dependence among cyber and physical components come at the price of increased vulnerability to failures and attacks. Hence, securing a CPS is extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to address the adaptive security in CPSs. First, we specify CPS on the basis of the CA-BRS (Control Agent and Bigraphical Reactive Systems) formalism, which combine agent and bigraphical reactive systems to deal with the virtual level (software), the physical level (execution machines and their environment) and the behavioural level (dynamics) of the CPS. The given formal model helps in answering several crucial modeling issues in CPS, such as the natural heterogeneity, the connected dynamics, the interaction between cyber and physical components and meanwhile, the non-functional properties as security and reliability. Then, this well defined specification of CPS is translated to BPMN (ISO/CEI 19510 standard of the OMG) in order to bring the formal model closer to the implementation. An illustrative example of a secure IT department in a smart factory is considered to consolidate our theoretical approach results. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

9,y,Mode security: an infrastructure for covert channel suppression,"The paper discusses a theory of covert channels called mode security. The general idea is to organize the state transitions of a multilevel state machine into distinct sets called modes. Roughly speaking, each machine mode is totally secure when considered in isolation of all other modes. Covert channels can therefore only occur when the machine executes a mode change decision; thus the name, mode security. The claim that all covert channels in a mode secure system are connected with mode change decisions can be satisfied by a generalization of the Turing test model of non-information flow.<>",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=296593,R.

197,y,Architecture and fuzzy adaptive security algorithm in intelligent firewall,"The architecture of an intelligent firewall is presented and then its modules are described in detail. A fuzzy controller is the core module and the characteristics of packets are fuzzified as its inputs. Based on the fuzzy adaptive security algorithm, the overall security level of each kind of packet can be figured out and adjusted according to the varying states of the packets. The intelligent firewall can respond to these changes and take different actions accordingly. Therefore, the intelligent firewall resolves the conflict between security and speed and retains both high security and high performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179639,Jun Zou; Kaining Lu; Zhigang Jin,10.1109/MILCOM.2002.1179639,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179639,200200.0,IEEE Conferences,IEEE Xplore,500,MILCOM 2002.

513,y,A Moving Target Defense Strategy for Internet of Things Cybersecurity,"Internet of Things (IoT) systems are becoming more common and present in our daily lives. The increase of Internet-connected devices has caused attackers to focus their attention more on these devices. Therefore, new and more sophisticated attacks on IoT systems are discovered every day. Currently, to ensure reliability and operability, most IoT systems are designed to operate in a relatively static configuration in a highly heterogeneous environment. However, a system that does not continuously change its configurations, i.e., a static system, gives an advantage to attackers; with enough time and resources, an attacker will eventually find and exploit the vulnerabilities of any static target. This work proposes a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy that randomly shuffles the communication protocols through which a node communicates to a gateway in an IoT network. The system’s configuration changes have an associated cost. The objective of the proposed MTD strategy in this work is to balance the increase in system performance overhead, the increase in business impact (system unavailability), and, at the same time, the decrease in the probability of success of a given attack. A framework is proposed to design this strategy; this framework can guide any MTD strategy for IoT systems. The framework’s objective is to find, after several iterations, the MTD strategy parameters that achieve a balance between five different measurable variables of an IoT system.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521488,A.

98,y,Multi-mode and distributed model predictive control for whole day train regulation,"To further improve the operation efficiency of metro trains, a multi-mode and distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm is proposed for whole day train regulation of metro transportation in presence of time-varying passenger arrival rate and disturbances. Firstly, a multi-mode switching train operation model in a metro line is built with a switched linear function describing dynamic passenger demand. Secondly, a DMPC-based strategy for train regulation is proposed to ensure the punctuality and security of whole day train operation. Furthermore, numerical examples are present and the progress and practicability of the proposed train regulation strategy are illustrated, revealing that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the computation time so as to improve the real-time regulation performance.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8623273,L.

395,y,Adaptive Trust-Aware Decentralized Information Flow Control,"Modern software systems are decentralized, distributed, and dynamic, and consequently, require decentralized mechanisms to enforce security. In this paper, we propose an adaptive approach using a combination of decentralized information flow control (DIFC) mechanisms, trust-based methods and decentralized control architectures to enforce security in open distributed systems. In our approach, adaptivity mitigates two aspects of the system dynamics that cause uncertainty: the ever-changing nature of trust and system openness. We formalize our trust-aware DIFC model and instantiate two decentralized control architectures to implement and evaluate it. We evaluate the effectiveness and performance of our method and decentralized control architectures on two case studies.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9196327,C. Skandylas; N.

1377,y,Supporting reconfigurable security policies for mobile programs,"Programming models that support code migration have gained prominence, mainly due to a widespread shift from stand-alone to distributed applications. Although appealing in terms of system design and extensibility, mobile programs are a security risk and require strong access control. Further, the mobile code environment is fluid, i.e. the programs and resources located on a host many change rapidly, necessitating an extensible security model. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a security infrastructure. The model is built around an event/response mechanism, in which a response is executed when a security-related event occurs. We support a fine-grained, conditional access control language, and enforce policies by instrumenting the bytecode of protected classes. This method enhances efficiency and promotes separation of concerns between security policy and program specification. This infrastructure also allows security policies to change at runtime, adapting to varying system state, intrusion, and other events.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033689082&doi=10.1016%2fS1389-1286%2800%2900075-X&partnerID=40&md5=bc07e9b05b31d8e03c0faa3b368bb8b6,"Hashii, B.

306,y,Adaptive Security Framework for Resource-Constrained Internet-of-Things Platforms,"The aim of this work is to investigate and define a dynamically adjustable security method, suitable especially for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), usually composed by resource constrained devices. In order to support both the high level of security and the need for long lifetime of battery powered wireless devices, flexible means to adjust the level of security at runtime is needed. To this end, the paper proposes a solution, whose main component in the security between wireless sensors and the gateway is an Adaptive Security Manager (ASM), which can select the required level of security and inform the resource about it, based on the context. This makes it possible to support both high level of security and long lifetime of battery powered wireless devices when needed. Based on commands from the ASM, wireless sensors can select the suitable key from pre-shared keys (PSKs).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7792431,E. Ferrera; R. Rossini; D.

7,y,Optimal Jamming Strategy Against Two-State Switched System,"In this letter, we investigate the security issue of a discrete linear time-varying system following a fixed switching rule. We first give a sufficient condition for the stability of this two-state switched system. In our scenario, the communication channel between the sensor and the remote estimator is interfered by a jammer with limited energy. Then we prove that the continuous jamming strategy is optimal compared with other strategies, which maximizes the estimation error in the viewpoint of the attacker. Finally, numerical examples are presented to certificate the effectiveness of the proposed optimal jamming strategy.",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9676585,Y. Zhu; H. Zhang; H.

502,y,Managing IoT Cyber-Security Using Programmable Telemetry and Machine Learning,"Cyber-security risks for Internet of Things (IoT) devices sourced from a diversity of vendors and deployed in large numbers, are growing rapidly. Therefore, management of these devices is becoming increasingly important to network operators. Existing network monitoring technologies perform traffic analysis using specialized acceleration on network switches, or full inspection of packets in software, which can be complex, expensive, inflexible, and unscalable. In this paper, we use SDN paradigm combined with machine learning to leverage the benefits of programmable flow-based telemetry with flexible data-driven models to manage IoT devices based on their network activity. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We analyze traffic traces of 17 real consumer IoT devices collected in our lab over a six-month period and identify a set of traffic flows (per-device) whose time-series attributes computed at multiple timescales (from a minute to an hour) characterize the network behavior of various IoT device types, and their operating states (i.e., booting, actively interacted with user, or being idle); (2) We develop a multi-stage architecture of inference models that use flow-level attributes to automatically distinguish IoT devices from non-IoTs, classify individual types of IoT devices, and identify their states during normal operations. We train our models and validate their efficacy using real traffic traces; and (3) We quantify the trade-off between performance and cost of our solution, and demonstrate how our monitoring scheme can be used in operation for detecting behavioral changes (firmware upgrade or cyber attacks).",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8981946,A.
