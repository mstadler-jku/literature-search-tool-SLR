10,y,A Network Access Control Architecture Using State-Transfer-Based Dynamic Policy,"The access control architecture using state-transfer-based dynamic policy is proposed to make access control more flexible and dynamic. This architecture can dynamically change the policy according to a state-transfer composed of a previous state and a current state. It can indicate the tendency of the system by using both previous and current information in order to decide a more appropriate policy to the current system and future condition. And there are two steps in this dynamic policy method, one is deciding a partial-state and the other one is deciding a state, two dynamic policy decision layers are included into this architecture in order to manage these two steps."
18,n,Algorithmic Analysis of the System Based on the Functioning Table and Information Security,"Systems are ideally and rapidly evolving with the development of the Internet and modern web technologies. Example, Ecological monitoring information system has become very important in determining its superiority as a system, so it should be tested. This article describes how to benchmark a system by creating a state change graph to simulate different intuitions on the part of each subsystem, and then comparing the graph to Petri net modeling based on Functioning table (PNMFT). Test cases can be prepared based on the accessibility of trees based on comparable PNMFTs. The existing fact-testing strategy for comprehensive testing of the system will be further generalized to improve the consistent quality of the remaining tests. After that, talk about algorithmic analysis of the system is an important for information security issue. The initial stage of ongoing research to improve the reliability of algorithmic analysis of algorithmic formalization of web systems is described. It may also be advisable to include a set of dynamic coverage criteria for web systems defined for the statistical testing approach used through algorithmic analysis to improve testing quality and algorithmic formalization of the web system through algorithmic analysis."
24,n,Software defined network: Future of networking,"The digital world we live in has been lead by the evolution of Internet, which has created revolution. Today almost everything is connected and accessible from anywhere, everywhere. Unfortunately, the traditional IP network system is still complex, not easily manageable and difficult to reconfigure in case of any change or fault. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm separates the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting logical centralization of network control and introducing the ability to program the network. It has become the focus in the current information and communication technology area because of its flexibility and programmability. SDN abstracts low-level network functionalities to simplify network management. The OpenFlow protocol implements the SDN concept by abstracting network elements. It offers flexible and scalable functionality for network by decoupling the network control from forwarding devices. SDN uses a REST API (Representational State Transfer) for communication between controller and another application."
67,n,Towards Further Formal Foundation of Web Security: Expression of Temporal Logic in Alloy and Its Application to a Security Model With Cache,"Security analysis of a web system is complicated, and thus analysis using formal methods to describe system specification mathematically has attracted attention. Some previous studies have adopted formal methods, but their models cannot express parallel communication completely. This limitation gives rise to problems where web functions, such as a cache that stores contents, cannot be defined and attacks that forge contents cannot be analyzed. These problems are present in the Alloy-based implementations of current models that do not have the ability to express temporal logic. Therefore, we design implementation and evaluation of temporal logic in Alloy to express time series and parallel computation for web security analysis. In doing so, state transitions in the web can be expressed by fitting them in our proposed syntax. As concrete applications, we describe a web security model that includes caches and show that our proposed syntax can analyze state-of-the-art attacks, such as unauthorized access to users' account pages via caches. The source code of our proposed model in Alloy is publicly available."
85,y,The STAT tool suite,"Describes a suite of intrusion detection tools developed by the Reliable Software Group at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB). The tool suite is based on the state transition analysis technique (STAT), in which computer penetrations are specified as sequences of actions that cause transitions in the security state of a system. This general approach has been extended and tailored to perform intrusion detection in different domains and environments. The most recent STAT-based intrusion detection systems were developed following a framework-based approach, and the resulting design uses a ""core"" module that embodies the domain-independent characteristics of the STAT approach. This generic core is extended in a well-defined way to implement intrusion detection systems for different domains and environments. The approach supports software reuse, portability and extendibility, and it allows for the optimization of critical functionalities."
96,y,Privacy-Preserving Medical Treatment System Through Nondeterministic Finite Automata,"In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving medical treatment system using nondeterministic finite automata (NFA), hereafter referred to as P-Med, designed for remote medical environment. P-Med makes use of the nondeterministic transition characteristic of NFA to flexibly represent medical model, which includes illness states, treatment methods and state transitions caused by exerting different treatment methods. A medical model is encrypted and outsourced to cloud to deliver telemedicine service. Using P-Med, patient-centric diagnosis and treatment can be made on-the-fly while protecting the confidentiality of patient’s illness states and treatment recommendation results. Moreover, a new privacy-preserving NFA evaluation method is given in P-Med to get a confidential match result for the evaluation of an encrypted NFA and an encrypted data set, which avoids the cumbersome inner state transition determination. We demonstrate that P-Med realizes treatment procedure recommendation without privacy leakage to unauthorized parties. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to evaluate the efficiency."
140,n,A Blockchain-Based Authentication and Security Mechanism for IoT,"The existing identity authentication of IoT devices mostly depends on an intermediary institution, i.e., a CA server, which suffers from the single-point-failure attack. Even worse, the critical data of authenticated devices can be tampered by inner attacks without being identified. To address these issues, we utilize blockchain technology, which serves as a secure tamper-proof distributed ledger to IoT devices. In the proposed method, we assign a unique ID for each individual device and record them into the blockchain, so that they can authenticate each other without a central authority. We also design a data protection mechanism by hashing significant data (i.e. firmware) into the blockchain where any state changes of the data can be detected immediately. Finally, we implement a prototype based on an open source blockchain platform Hyperledger Fabric to verify the proposed system."
144,n,"Effects of layer thickness for GSAW, PSAW and HVPSAW devices","Considerable efforts in recent SAW device design and development have aimed at low loss, high performance and high frequency operation. A large number of applications relate to cellular and mobile telephony, pagers, local area networks, cordless phones, global positioning systems, and security systems. Pseudo-SAW (PSAW) and more recently the High Velocity Pseudo-SAW (HVPSAW) have received a great deal of attention due to their high phase velocities, and therefore the high frequencies of operation these modes may provide. In addition to high phase velocities, the pseudo-modes must also present low propagation losses and considerably high electromechanical coupling coefficients to be considered for practical devices. This paper verifies that the metallic layer thickness is a relevant SAW device parameter in order to achieve lower losses, for high frequency, high electromechanical coupling, low loss SAW devices. Popular PSAW and HVPSAW material orientations such as 64/spl deg/ YX LiNbO/sub 3/(0/spl deg/ 26/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), 36/spl deg/ YX LiTaO/sub 3/ (0/spl deg/-54/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), LiNbO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 36/spl deg/), LiTaO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 31/spl deg/), quartz ST-X (0/spl deg/ 132.75/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), Li/sub 2/B/sub 4/O/sub 7/ (0/spl deg/ 45/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/), among others, are considered. In addition to the lower losses and the dispersion analysis for the pseudo modes, the present work discusses the transitions with layer thickness from HVPSAWs to higher order PSAWs modes, and the transitions from PSAWs to the generalized SAWs (GSAWs) modes. Besides contributing to the knowledge of the pseudo-modes behavior with layer thickness, this mode transition analysis enlightens the situation where the losses in the pseudo modes go to zero, due to the merging of the pseudo modes into the GSAWs. The fact that as a function of thickness the GSAWs are a natural continuation for the pseudo modes may be conveniently used in the fabrication of low loss devices. For completeness the effects of heavy layer metals, such as gold, in reducing the layer thickness where the pseudo modes merge to the GSAWs are discussed. Numerical results are compared to some experimental data available in the literature, and the present analysis elucidates experimentally observed higher order pseudo modes, and values of layer thickness where lower losses are achieved."
150,n,Defining the possible variants of a sectioned network by using a modified Newton-Raphson algorithm,"Congestions and undesirable power flows are an increasingly common occurrence in transmission networks. One possible measure to eliminate the congestion in network would be changing the network's topology since the stated changes the impedance of the network, which results in a change of power flow. Since the change in network topology has various implications, it can also be used as a powerful tool in optimization techniques resulting in reduction of power system losses, as well as in the already mentioned congestion management. This study deals with a new approach to the problem of changes in network topology based on application of a three-dimensional matrix of admittance, and with automating the process of power flow calculations for all possible variants of the network."
159,n,Using cloud SaaS to ensure interoperability and standardization in heterogeneous Cloud based environment,"During the last years, because of the evolution of Cloud applications and the attractive advantages given to consumers, many companies outsource their data and Information Technology (IT) system to the Cloud based technology. With the growth in the number of Cloud Service Providers, many enterprises and organizations can use and associate services from multiple providers. There may be many Internet protocols for service access standards that are used to ensure interoperability between users browser and Web server, such as Representational State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Each service has its specific characteristics such as authentication and security requirements. Hence, Cloud providers attempt to lock customers into proprietary interfaces so consumers can find themselves at not expects inevitable vendor lock-in. Therefore, the focus of our paper is to propose a solution to this problem by using Cloud intermediate between Cloud providers and consumer in heterogeneous Cloud environments interfaces. This is to achieve benefits such as standardization and interoperability, minimizing lock-in of Cloud providers. To reach such benefits, we propose a Cloud SaaS based on two interfaces and an internet component. These interfaces are used in Cloud Consumer and Provider sides and therefore guarantee communication between Cloud Consumer and Provider using different Internet protocols for Web service access such as REST and SOAP. Our approach guarantees interoperability and standardization in heterogeneous Cloud based environments because in this case Cloud Consumer and Provider using REST interface can communicate easily with Cloud Provider and Consumer using SOAP interface."
191,n,An adaptive security end-system model based on active defense,"In order to enhance the security of Web service as well as to support the differentiated service, the paper puts forward an adaptive model, which is based on active defense strategy. It uses a network prediction model on base of self-similar sequence theory to estimate current slates of transfer servers in end-system, then classifies them with fuzzy-C-means clustering method. Finally, we bring forward a load balancing algorithm that is founded on the classification results and grading users' requests. In that way, it optimizes the allocation of system resources and ensures data security and reliability. Moreover, this model is not dependent on the original operating system and is transplantable and extensible"
205,y,Adaptive Cyber Security for Critical Infrastructure,"In the modern era, much of worldwide critical operations from a variety of different sectors are managed by industrial control systems (ICS). A typical ICS includes an extensive range of comput-erized devices, control systems, and networking appliances used to manage efficiently an industrial process across large geographical areas. ICS underpin sensitive and critical national infrastructures such as water treatment and energy production and transportation. The consequences of a successful attack against them can lead to shutting the infrastructure down which has major impacts such as production stoppages or safety implications for people, the environment, and assets. At the same time, running a process while the infrastructure is under attack or compromised also has safety im-plications, potentially catastrophic. This work-in-progress focuses on an adaptive approach, able to alter the defensive posture while providing assurances about operational capacity (or downgrading it) and safety. Our approach involves transforming policies from simply a means to enforce security requirements defined a priori, to adaptive objects that are capable to evolve in response to unfolding attacks. We use a case study of reconnaissance attacks and moving target defense as a means to realize such adaptive security policies."
213,y,Multi modal verification for teleservices and security applications (M2VTS),"The paper presents the European ACTS project ""M2VTS"" which stands for Multi Modal Verification for Teleservices and Security Applications. The primary goal of this project is to address the issue of secured access to local and centralised services in a multimedia environment. The main objective is to extend the scope of application of network based services by adding novel and intelligent functionalities, enabled by automatic verification systems combining multimodal strategies (secured access based on speech, image or other information). The objectives of the project are also to show that limitations of individual technologies (speaker verification, frontal face authentication, profile identification...) can be overcome by relying on multi modal decisions (combination or fusion of these technologies)."

Furthermore, to show how such an architecture can enhance the security of nuclear power systems, this paper present a vision for this architectural formulation for a Nuclear Power Plant Turbine Control System."
232,n,Research on Real Power Grid Security and Stability Based on Big Data Analysis Method and Online Data of Power Grid,"In terms of the accumulation of historical data of the power system, China's power grids have accumulated a great number of dispatching and operating data which contains different voltage levels. Online safety and stability analysis conduct a comprehensive system assessment every 15 minutes, including power flow, short circuit, static safety analysis, voltage stability, transient stability, small disturbance stability, limit transmission power, and scheduling assistance decision-making, and the calculation data and result data are about 1G. Based on the six-month online historical data accumulated by a provincial power grid, this paper studies the characteristics of the actual power grid security and stability, and proposes a system stability analysis method based on the online security analysis of historical resources. At the same time, Considering the time-varying characteristics of the power system, an operation rule extracting method was proposed. Firstly, based on the correlation analysis methods, the corresponding features are selected for each type on the hierarchical grid. Then, a power grid security risk assessment system is established based on load ratio, and line limitation. Finally, this article automatically discovers the characteristics and rules of grid dispatching operations from numerous online data, provides a theoretical basis for operational mode and scheduling decisions, further improves the ability of large-scale grid dispatching and online safety analysis, and enhances the ability of power grids to resist the influence of external factors on safe and stable operations ability and has important practical application value."
260,y,Engineering topology aware adaptive security: Preventing requirements violations at runtime,"Adaptive security systems aim to protect critical assets in the face of changes in their operational environment. We have argued that incorporating an explicit representation of the environment's topology enables reasoning on the location of assets being protected and the proximity of potentially harmful agents. This paper proposes to engineer topology aware adaptive security systems by identifying violations of security requirements that may be caused by topological changes, and selecting a set of security controls that prevent such violations. Our approach focuses on physical topologies; it maintains at runtime a live representation of the topology which is updated when assets or agents move, or when the structure of the physical space is altered. When the topology changes, we look ahead at a subset of the future system states. These states are reachable when the agents move within the physical space. If security requirements can be violated in future system states, a configuration of security controls is proactively applied to prevent the system from reaching those states. Thus, the system continuously adapts to topological stimuli, while maintaining requirements satisfaction. Security requirements are formally expressed using a propositional temporal logic, encoding spatial properties in Computation Tree Logic (CTL). The Ambient Calculus is used to represent the topology of the operational environment - including location of assets and agents - as well as to identify future system states that are reachable from the current one. The approach is demonstrated and evaluated using a substantive example concerned with physical access control."
266,n,Automatic management of network security policy,"The paper describes work in our project funded by the DARPA Dynamic Coalitions program to design, develop, and demonstrate a system for automatically managing security policies in dynamic networks. Specifically, we aim to reduce human involvement in network management by building a practical network reconfiguration system so that simple security policies stated as positive and negative invariants are upheld as the network changes. The focus of this project is a practical tool to help systems administrators verifiably enforce simple multi-layer network security policies. Our key design considerations are computational cost of policy validation and the power of the enforcement primitives. The central component is a policy engine populated by models of network elements and services that validates policies and computes new configuration settings for network elements when they are violated. We instantiate our policy enforcement tool using a monitoring and instrumentation layer that reports network changes as they occur and implements configuration changes computed by the policy engine."

This risk assessment is continually performed and updated based on changes to security-related information pertaining to a particular flight, as well as changes to the security environment external to the flight; e.g., other flights, airports, and airspace. This dynamic risk assessment is part of the NextGen layered, adaptive security concept in which technologies, policies, and procedures are adaptively scaled and deployed to counter a particular threat. This paper describes key information concepts for dynamic flight security risk assessment."
354,n,Probabilistic Evaluation of Substation Criticality Based on Static and Dynamic System Performances,"In most practical cases, traditional methods for assessing the reliability of substations, separately from the electric power network, are not sufficient to a good understanding of the system performance and possible reinforcements. This paper presents a new methodology to evaluate the criticality of electrical substations taking into account their possible operating states, associate probabilities, and consequences on the static and dynamic performance of the electric power system. Two complementary reliability indices are proposed to express the dynamic security and static adequacy levels that a substation provides to the power grid. An application in a test system is presented and the substation criticality ranking is provided and discussed."
381,n,Dynamically evolvable distributed systems,"Dynamic evolution allows designers to move logic from interpreted data structures into directly executed code. This provides the efficiency of code-driven security enforcement without sacrificing flexibility. The Evolvable Systems Project (ESP) at University of California, is developing techniques for safely and securely evolve distributed Java applications at runtime. We briefly describe the design and implementation of a type-safe model for dynamically modifying Java programs on a single host. We then describe how this model can be applied for building an adaptive security infrastructure. An extension of the single host model to a distributed environment is considered. Finally, we conclude with a brief outline of the project and the future work."
386,n,The method of selecting the operation modes of the multifunctional HF radio,"The article proposes the method for determining the operation modes of the multifunctional radio using the theory of fuzzy logic. The method takes into account the requirements for customers of various categories of importance. The method implements two ways of evaluating the effectiveness of each of the available operating modes of the radio. In the first case, the timely, credibility and security of information transmission on the specified radio route is evaluated. In the second case, the system supports decision-making based on the expert assessment is used. The method would be used for the development of an automated system decided to determine the operation modes of a multifunctional radio."
436,y,"Adaptive SSL: Design, Implementation and Overhead Analysis","Adaptive security is based on the observation that the security requirements of a system or service heavily depend on the environment in which they operate and should therefore be dynamically adjusted to best operate within that environment as the environment changes. In this paper we are concerned with adapting the choice of cryptographic algorithms applied to client-server interactions. To that end, we design and implement an adaptation controller for SSL (Secure Socket Layer), called Adaptive SSL."
439,n,Design of a GPS-enabled multi-modal multi-controlled intelligent spybot,"Intelligent robots need to have the ability to adjust their actions, state and behavior (i.e., response), as per the inputs that could be influenced by their immediate environment and/or situation/s. Hence, intelligent robots have diverse applications in domains such as security, automation, industry and agriculture. Such robots when used for surveillance or spying operations by military or police forces are called spybots. This paper aims to highlight the need and importance of developing systems that have the ability to remotely control their functions, response and operation, using multiple-controls and commands given by multiple-modalities. As an example, to give a live physical demonstration of the proposed concepts, a prototype smart spybot is developed. The prototype spybot can be controlled using multi-modalities such as text, touch, speech and gestures. It can be remotely operated using an application running on an Android based smart-phone, or a website, or an interactive program running on a laptop. Each can be connected by wires or wirelessly. The prototype spybot also has decision making capability and obstacle-avoidance feature. It is GPS enabled, and can be used as a tracker also. This intelligent spybot can directly fetch the live-video feeds and the spied data to a website, along with GPS coordinates. Since the prototype spybot is speech and gesture-enabled, it can also be used effectively by the people having restricted physical abilities. The initial performance results and trials are encouraging. The prototype spybot can potentially be used for a range of applications."
444,y,Adaptive Cybersecurity Monitoring for Resilient Vehicular Architectures,"The use of new technologies in vehicles, such as automation and connectivity, results in the addition of more software components, which in turn increases the potential vulnerabilities and attack surfaces for the vehicle. To address this, cybersecurity monitoring of vehicle fleets is required to detect and respond to potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities. The aim of this research is to explore a technological approach to fleet monitoring using established IT standards and techniques. The approach involves collecting, filtering, and forwarding cybersecurity information from multiple sources within the vehicle by instrumenting the ROS 2-based architecture and integrating these data sources with the log management tool syslog-ng. The logging configuration can be adapted at runtime using a ROS 2 interface that we developed. The approach is demonstrated with our fleet simulation setup “Fleet in the Loop” and a sophisticated data collection in a Knowledge Graph. The approach at hand can be used to seamlessly integrate ROS 2 in common IT monitoring tools and efficiently increase the resilience of vehicles by integrating adaptive security monitoring."

494,n,On the Impact of Early Design Decisions on Quality Attributes of Automated Driving Systems,"Initiatives such as smart mobility and automated driving bring new concerns such as safety and security for the automotive industry. New architecture and designs are required for the in-vehicle systems to address these emerging concerns. Early design decisions have a large impact on the required functionalities as well as the quality attributes of these systems. Understanding the impact of design decisions on the system quality is crucial for successful system development. It is difficult to estimate the requirements for safety (at an early development stage) considering the innovation aspect of automated driving. These safety requirements have a considerable influence on project planning and development cost. Therefore, it is important for the industry to understand the decision points and their impact on system design. In this article, we share our experience on understanding the impact of early design decisions on safety requirements. We particularly discuss the impact of design decisions regarding the operational design domain on (functional) safety. We provide two automated driving systems as discussion cases and investigate the impact of the operational situation on the safety requirements such as safe state and degraded operating mode. We show how posting small constraints on the operational situation can result in simplification of the sensor and actuator requirements of these systems."

518,n,A Conception of Prospects for Application of Edge Computing Technology in Equipment Support,"Edge computing is a new computing model that is different from the traditional cloud computing model. It helps to relieve the pressure on the network bandwidth and cloud computing center, reduce the computing system latency, and improve the service responsiveness by deploying computing and storage resources closer to the network edge and data source. Edge computing has been widely used and rapidly developed in the civil field due to its numerous benefits. In order to make better use of edge computing technology in military applications, we have carefully analyzed the characteristics of the military application environment. In response to these characteristics, we believe that edge computing technology can be applied to the field of equipment maintenance in order to improve equipment maintenance effectiveness. Based on these, researchers proposed a deployment model and main application scenarios for edge computing technology utilized in the equipment support field. Finally, researchers summarized three major advantages and proposed three suggestions to promote the use of edge computing technology in the equipment support field."
529,y,Towards Requirements for Self-Healing as a Means of Mitigating Cyber-Intrusions in Medical Devices,"In recent years, “security by design” has become a fundamental requirement for new technologies, especially for those that interconnect various systems and their components, e.g., implanted medical devices with remote configurability capabilities. As such, security of implanted medical devices has become a concern exacerbated by the tight constraints characterizing them and the need to ensure patients’ safety as these devices typically work to assure life-critical functions. To protect such systems, multiple proposals have been made to detect threats and mitigate vulnerabilities and malware intrusions. A common approach is utilizing hardware redundancy to deal with system faults, however, implanted medical devices work under tight power and area constraints that may not always allow for redundancy.In this paper, we build on an existing multi-modal based mitigation scheme for securing medical devices and propose self-healing capabilities that would allow the device to automatically reestablish functionalities compromised due to external threats."
539,n,"Southeast Michigan 2014 Test Bed project architecture update: Developing, refining and implementing the USDOT's Connected Vehicle Reference Implementation Architecture","The US Department of Transportation's (USDOT) Southeast Michigan Connected Vehicle Test Bed originally hosted USDOT Proof of Concept Testing (POC), starting in 2007. Following the success of the POC, the USDOT initiated the development of a Connected Vehicle Reference Implementation Architecture (CVRIA), and in 2013 began the final design and trial implementation of the CVRIA at the USDOT's Southeast Michigan Connected Vehicle Test Bed. All users of this facility are encouraged to develop and deploy solutions (hardware and software) using a common graphical language that is based on the updated Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) National Architecture. The development of the project architecture for the Southeast Michigan 2014 Test Bed project has been an iterative process as it is the first real-world implementation of the CVRIA. As a result, the initial architecture design shown in December 2013 has evolved significantly based both on lessons learned from the development and showcasing of the architecture and from the implementation of various components to facilitate implementation and long-term growth and use of the system. The Southeast Michigan Test Bed has been built to accommodate a wide range of user agreements. It is secure and accessible to a wide range of users, including the traveler - often multi-modal - and commercial and transportation providers and authorities. In addition, it is flexible enough to support additional test beds throughout the country by providing a common platform that permits those facilities to focus their resources on testing and developing applications and systems that are relevant to those test beds. In this paper, we present the updated system architecture and our process for evaluation through industry collaboration."
541,n,Technical and Operational Scenarios,"Developing technical and operational scenarios is an activity that spans from policy to technical implementation in determining the controls and indicators used in proper system evaluation. A popular approach for performing high‐level evaluation includes threat modeling, which provides opportunities for future scenario and Course of Action (COA) use cases. The ARMOUR Framework provides example technical and operational scenarios with the aim of supporting an overall cyber framework. Protective cyber scenarios take a variety of forms. Proactive scenarios are used to evaluate how the network responds to anomalies, or time to detect anomalous devices and configuration changes. Reactive scenarios, on the other hand, often training focused, and are used to perform standard Disaster Recovery/Continuity of Operations (DR/COOP) enterprise evaluations. Technical scenarios primarily deal with network anomalies. Cyber Operational Architecture Training System (COATS) explores methods for using modeling & simulation (M&S) to support training."
544,n,Self-Organising and Self-Learning Model for Soybean Yield Prediction,"Machine learning has arisen with advanced data analytics. Many factors influence crop yield, such as soil, amount of water, climate, and genotype. Determining factors that significantly influence yield prediction and identify the most appropriate predictive methods are important in yield management. It is critical to consider and study the combination of different crop factors and their impact on the yield. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to use advanced data analytic techniques to precisely predict the soybean crop yields, (2) to identify the most influential features that impact soybean predictions, (3) to illustrate the ability of Fuzzy Rule-Based (FRB) sub-systems, which are self-organizing, self-learning, and data-driven, by using the recently developed Autonomous Learning Multiple-Model First-order (ALMMo-1) system, and (4) to compare the performance with other well-known methods. The ALMMo-1 system is a transparent model, which stakeholders can easily read and interpret. The model is a data-driven and composed of prototypes selected from the actual data. Many factors affect the yield, and data clouds can be formed in the feature/data space based on the data density. The data cloud is the key to the IF part of FRB sub-systems, while the THEN part (the consequences of the IF condition) illustrates the yield prediction in the form of a linear regression model, which consists of the yield features or factors. In addition, the model can determine the most influential features of the yield prediction online. The model shows an excellent prediction accuracy with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0883, and Non-Dimensional Error Index (NDEI) of 0.0611, which is competitive with state-of-the-art methods."
546,n,On Adversarial Robustness Of Large-Scale Audio Visual Learning,"As audio-visual systems are being deployed for safety-critical tasks such as surveillance and malicious content filtering, their robustness remains an under-studied area. Existing published work on robustness either does not scale to large-scale dataset, or does not deal with multiple modalities. This work aims to study several key questions related to multi-modal learning through the lens of robustness: 1) Are multi-modal models necessarily more robust than uni-modal models? 2) How to efficiently measure the robustness of multi-modal learning? 3) How to fuse different modalities to achieve a more robust multi-modal model? To understand the robustness of the multi-modal model in a large-scale setting, we propose a density-based metric, and a convexity metric to efficiently measure the distribution of each modality in high-dimensional latent space. Our work provides a theoretical intuition together with empirical evidence showing how multi-modal fusion affects adversarial robustness through these metrics. We further devise a mix-up strategy based on our metrics to improve the robustness of the trained model. Our experiments on AudioSet [1] and Kinetics-Sounds [2] verify our hypothesis that multi-modal models are not necessarily more robust than their uni-modal counterparts in the face of adversarial examples. We also observe our mix-up trained method could achieve as much protection as traditional adversarial training, offering a computationally cheap alternative."
572,n,Fault Diagnosis of Air Compressor in Nuclear Power Plant Based on Vibration Observation Window,"Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) have increasing demand to improve safety and reliability of air compressors with various fault diagnosis methods. Fault diagnosis methods may provide early fault warning information for air compressors rapidly and give a reference for maintenance, especially for the serious faults affecting security strongly. In this work, a method framework of fault diagnosis system based on the Vibration Observation Window (VOW) for air compressors is proposed. The VOW constructs a dynamic vibration tensor which presents the operating state of air compressors according to the real time vibration data, strengthens the association among the monitoring data in spatial domain and time domain. Thus, dynamic characteristic, which reflects the fault information, can be contained in the dynamic vibration tensor explicitly. For proving the advantage of VOW method, we compare the performance between the fault diagnosis system with VOW and the fault diagnosis system without VOW based on different hardware environments: embedded computer, and high speed Industrial PC. The results show that the VOW method can both improve the performance of the vibration fault diagnosis system of NPPs in different hardware environments."
585,n,A Testbed for Adaptive Security for IoT in EHealth,"Wireless Body Area Sensor Networks (WBASNs) are networks of low-power sensing objects that collect and send vital signs of a patient using low-rate communication media. They have been originally created to improve the efficiency of e-health applications and they constitute now an important part of the Internet of Things (IoT) by bringing humans into the IoTs. The ASSET (Adaptive Security for Smart Internet of Things in eHealth) project [1] develops risk-based adaptive security methods and mechanisms for IoT in eHealth. The project requires a real-life testbed to evaluate accurately the adaptive security solutions in realistic simulation and use case scenarios. This paper describes the setup of a testbed for adaptive security for the IoT using current commercial off-the-shelf products and open source software. The particular features of the proposed testbed with regard to those published in the literature are underlined. The paper also discusses the validation of the setup through the study of the impact of antenna orientation on energy consumption. To this purpose, an estimation strategy of the energy consumption using the Holt-Winters prediction method has been developed. This will particularly be useful when studying the feasibility of the adaptive lightweight security solutions that will be part of the ASSET project."
604,n,Multi-Aspect Security Configuration Assessment,"Evaluating the security of a computer network system is a challenging task. Configurations of large systems are complex entities in continuous evolution. The installation of new software, a change in the firewall rules, or the discovery of a software vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious user to gain unauthorized control of the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the assets of an organization.This paper presents a framework for building security assessment tools able to perform online verification of the security of a system configuration. Heterogeneous data generated from multiple sources are integrated into a homogeneous RDF representation using domain-specific ontologies and used for assessing the security of a configuration toward known attack vectors. Different vocabularies can be defined to express configurations, policies and attacks for each aspect of the security of an organization (e.g., network security, physical security and application level security) in a modular way. By automatically extracting part of the configuration from the network system, the tool is able to detect in near real-time security threats created by configuration changes."
606,n,Threat Modeling for Security Assessment in Cyberphysical Systems,"In this paper, threat modeling issues in cyberphysical systems are discussed. First a generic model of a cyberphysical system is outlined, with an attack surface suitable for security analysis. Then, a case study of network communication in a road vehicle is presented, with its behavior modeled by a discrete time Markov chain, under the assumption that security violations can cause gradual degradation of functionality. Finally, two ways of numerical assessment of vulnerabilities are analyzed, to help better estimate probabilities of state changes in a Markov model."
624,n,The Runtime Model Checking Method for Zero Trust Security Policy,"The policy administrator is a zero trust dynamic authority determination component, which is mainly responsible for the management, storage and evaluation of policies. Aiming at the evaluation of the security and effectiveness of the policies in the policy administrator, this paper proposes to introduce the policy model online service verification component in the policy administrator. First, the policy file is formalized into a policy instance logic specification through logical abstraction, and then the policy instance logic specification Perform model check with the policy abstract logic specification developed by the policy designer to realize the pre-check verification of the consistency of the police file. After the completion of the pre-check and verification, the policy will be executed for the policy manager to make a decision on the execution point of the policy. At this time, the system operating state data intercepted by the policy enforcement point and the embedded system's security, compliance, and legal treaty form process specifications are used to perform model post-check to achieve the security and alarm after the implementation of the policy. Through the combination of pre-check and post-check, the evaluation and testing of the policy and effectiveness of the zero-trust security policy are finally realized."
639,n,Mechanising Blockchain Consensus,"We present the first formalisation of a blockchain-based distributed consensus protocol with a proof of its consistency mechanised in an interactive proof assistant. Our development includes a reference mechanisation of the block forest data structure, necessary for implementing provably correct per-node protocol logic. We also define a model of a network, implementing the protocol in the form of a replicated state-transition system. The protocol's executions are modeled via a small-step operational semantics for asynchronous message passing, in which packages can be rearranged or duplicated. In this work, we focus on the notion of global system safety, proving a form of eventual consistency. To do so, we provide a library of theorems about a pure functional implementation of block forests, define an inductive system invariant, and show that, in a quiescent system state, it implies a global agreement on the state of per-node transaction ledgers. Our development is parametric with respect to implementations of several security primitives, such as hash-functions, a notion of a proof object, a Validator Acceptance Function, and a Fork Choice Rule. We precisely characterise the assumptions, made about these components for proving the global system consensus, and discuss their adequacy. All results described in this paper are formalised in Coq."
658,n,Towards Automated and Optimized Security Orchestration in Cloud SLA,"In cloud computing, providers pool their resources and make them available to customers. Next-generation computer scientists are flocking to the cutting-edge field of cloud computing for their research and exploration of uncharted territory. There are still several barriers that cloud service providers must overcome in order to provide cloud services in accordance with service level agreements. Each cloud service provider aspires to achieve maximum performance as per Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and this is especially true when it comes to the delivery of services. A cloud service level agreement (SLA) guarantees that cloud service providers will satisfy the needs of large businesses and offer their clients with a specified list of services. The authors offer a web service level agreement–inspired approach for cloud service agreements. We adopt patterns and antipatterns to symbolize the best and worst practices of OCCI (Open Cloud Computing Interface Standard), REST (Representational State Transfer), and TOSCA (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) with DevOps solutions, all of which API developers should bear in mind when designing APIs. When using this method, everything pertaining to the cloud service, from creation to deployment to measurement to evaluation to management to termination, may be handled mechanically. When distributing resources to cloud apps, our system takes into account the likelihood of SLA breaches and responds by providing more resources if necessary. We say that for optimal performance, our suggested solution should be used in a private cloud computing setting. As more and more people rely on cloud computing for their day-to-day workloads, there has been a corresponding rise in the need for efficient orchestration and management strategies that foster interoperability. © 2023 International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication.

698,n,Regularity-Based Virtualization under the ARINC 653 Standard for Embedded Systems,"In embedded real-time virtualized systems (ERTVS), the ARINC 653 standard specifies a cyclic scheduling policy to guarantee the real-time performance of tasks in multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) residing on shared hardware. Based on this policy, the Regularity-based Resource Partitioning (RRP) model defines an efficient interface specification to hierarchically partition and assign resource slices among VMs. Although this model has received plenty of attention recently, three major pieces remain missing for applying this model in ERTVS. (1) Embedded systems are more sensitive to resource utilization efficiency since this may drastically affect their deployment cost for including additional cores. Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal and an approximate RRP resource scheduler for multi-core platforms. (2) A resource reconfiguration is required when an embedded system has to switch between operating modes, resulting in the current cyclic schedule being replaced by another pre-configured and verified cyclic schedule. This paper formalizes a new One-Hop Reconfiguration (OHR) problem tailored for mode-switch-capable embedded systems and introduces a corresponding optimal solution. (3) No RRP-based toolset is currently available for embedded systems. This paper thus presents an optimized RRP toolset tailored for embedded systems. Numerous experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of this toolset.  © 1968-2012 IEEE."
720,n,Cyber-attack research for integrated energy systems by the correlated matrix based object-oriented modeling method,"The rise of an integrated energy system requires the integration of multiple sources of energy to be embraced and transited over the power grid; that means the information and communication systems of traditional power systems will be extended, and their complexity will be increased. As the information and communication systems play a more important role in the infrastructure of the power system, a cyber-attack on them may have an impact on the power system and cause a serious threat to the integrated energy system. To analyze the threat to the complex and integrated system, some researchers provide some modeling methods to study the impact of cyber-attacks on the information and communication systems, such as the Attack Tree Model, Attack Graph Model, Petri Net Model for cyber-attack, Attack Description Language Model, State Transition Graph Model, etc. However, these modeling methods have some shortcomings. For example, they cannot describe the systematical cyber-attack and show the secure status during the cyber-attack; it is hard for them to analyze the larger and more complicated information and communication systems. To overcome the shortages, in this paper, a correlated matrix-based object-oriented model is proposed for cyber-attack modeling. With this model, the relationship between the attacker and victim can be directly built; the cyber-attack path and packets from the attacker can be tracked; and the status of the nodes and links can be shown during a cyber-attack. There are two steps to build the cyber-attack model. Firstly, the procedure and approach of the cyber-attack will be modeled by an object-oriented method; then, a correlated matrix model will be built for network topology, attack path, and attack procedure. By combining these two models, the whole cyber-attack model is created. Finally, to demonstrate the modeling method and its benefits, we use the MITM (Man-in-the-middle Attack) attack on measurement data of an AVC (Automation Voltage Control) system as examples, and build a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) co-simulation platform to verify the model.

734,n,Towards Developing a Data Security Aware Federated Training Framework in Multi-Modal Contested Environments,"Secure data communication is crucial in contested environments such as battlefields. In such environments, there is always risk of data breach through unauthorized interceptions. This may lead to unauthorized access to tactical information and infiltration into the systems. In this work, we propose a detailed training setup in the federated learning framework for object classification where the raw data will be maintained locally at the edge devices and will not be shared with a central server or with each other. The server sends a global model to edge devices, which is then trained locally at the edge, and the updated parameters are sent back to the central server, where they are aggregated, which takes place iteratively. This setup ensures robustness against malicious cyberattacks as well as reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, to tackle the irregularity in object classification task with a single data modality in such contested environment, a deep learning model incorporating multiple modalities is used as the global model in our proposed federated learning setup. This model can serve as a possible solution in object identification with multi-modal data. We conduct a comprehensive analysis on the importance of multi-modal approach compared to individual modalities within our proposed federate learning setup. We also provide a resource profiling based on memory requirements, training time, and energy usage on two resource constrained devices to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. © 2022 SPIE."
740,n,Modeling Technology of Naval Formation Area Antiaircraft Kill Web based on Event Graph,"Future air defense missions of naval formation are becoming more and more diverse, and various combat resources are deployed, which poses new challenges to the traditional area antiaircraft system. This research focuses on the 'orientation' of the confrontation, and builds the kill web model of area air defense based on event graph. Under the event graph paradigm, the state change of air target is the fundamental constraint of event evolution, and the continuous dynamic process of the operational implementation is transformed into a discrete dynamic process composed of key events. Through the analysis of the constraints and correlations of area air defense operational elements, the tactical action effect evaluation model is used to evaluate the resource combination scheme, and the final optimal combination scheme is determined based on the intelligent algorithm, thereby exploring a new way for the construction of a naval formation area air defense kill web.  © 2022 IEEE."
750,n,Multimodal Classification of Onion Services for Proactive Cyber Threat Intelligence Using Explainable Deep Learning,"The dark web has been confronted with a significant increase in the number and variety of onion services of illegitimate and criminal intent. Anonymity, encryption, and the technical complexity of the Tor network are key challenges in detecting, disabling, and regulating such services. Instead of tracking an operational location, cyber threat intelligence can become more proactive by utilizing recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect and classify onion services based on the content, as well as provide an interpretation of the classification outcome. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal classification approach based on explainable deep learning that classifies onion services based on the image and text content of each site. A Convolutional Neural Network with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and a pre-trained word embedding with Bahdanau additive attention are the core capabilities of this approach that classify and contextualize the representative features of an onion service. We demonstrate the superior classification accuracy of this approach as well as the role of explainability in decision-making that collectively enables proactive cyber threat intelligence in the dark web.  © 2013 IEEE."
753,n,The Application of Beidou and Ultra-Broadband Positioning Technology in the Power Security Protection System,"In the Beidou positioning system, due to the obstruction of obstacles, the indoor is often unable to obtain positioning information. For this case, a scheme based on Beidou indoor and outdoor integration positioning is proposed. First, the algorithms of satellite localization and ultra wide band localization are studied, and a high-precision positioning algorithm compatible with both positioning modes is proposed. Seamless switching algorithm can realize positioning mode switching without affecting positioning accuracy. Based on the research of algorithm model of substation, determine the layout mode and positioning accuracy, and solve the problem of weak signal of indoor positioning. This scheme guarantees the positioning accuracy in the practical application environment, and it provides a theoretical basis for the positioning of people and equipment in the power system. © 2022, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
760,n,Steady-State Availability Evaluation for Heterogeneous Edge Computing-Enabled WSNs with Malware Infections,"To evaluate the steady-state availability of heterogeneous edge computing-enabled wireless sensor networks (HECWSNs) with malware infections, we first propose a Stackelberg attack-defence game to predict the optimal strategies of malware and intrusion detection systems (IDSs) deployed in heterogeneous sensor nodes (HSNs). Next, we present a new malware infection model-heterogeneous susceptible-threatened-active-recovered-dead (HSTARD) based on epidemic theory. Then, considering the heterogeneity of sink sensor nodes and common sensor nodes and the malware attack correlation, we derive the state transition probability matrix of an HSN based on a semi-Markov process (SMP), as well as the steady-state availability of an HSN. Furthermore, based on a data flow analysis of HSNs, we deduce the steady-state availability of HECWSNs with various topologies, including the star topology, cluster topology, and mesh topology. Finally, numerical analyses illustrate the influence of the IDS parameters on the optimal infection probability of malware and reveal the effect of multiple factors on the steady-state availability of HSNs, including the initial infection rate, the infection change rate, and the malware attack correlation. In addition, we present data analyses of the steady-state availability of HECWSNs with various topologies, including the star topology, cluster topology, and mesh topology, which provide a theoretical basis for the design, deployment, and maintenance of high-availability HECWSNs.  © 2022 Hong Zhang et al."
769,n,Modeling and simulation of secure connectivity and hop count of multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks with colluding and non-colluding eavesdroppers,"Connectivity and hop count are two crucial attributes of dynamic wireless networks such as ad-hoc wireless networks (AHWNs). When the security issue is considered, establishing a secure multi-hop path in AHWNs is challenging because an intermediate node having a wireless link with previous nodes may not be secure to receive data from those nodes, and vice versa. In this paper, stochastic geometry graphs is used to model the AHWNs with eavesdroppers’ presence, then a simulation-based analysis method is proposed to investigate the characteristics of connectivity, hop count distribution, average hop count, and their relations in various scenarios. The proposed simulation-based analysis method consists of two algorithms. The first one finds all possible secure communication paths between two arbitrary legitimate users selected as source and destination and returns the shortest path's hop count. This algorithm utilizes the random locations of legitimate users and eavesdroppers, the wireless channel condition, and the eavesdropper's operating mode as input data. The second one provides the hop count distribution and the connection probability of the obtained multi-hop path of the first algorithm by averaging a huge number of network topology trials. So far, this paper is the first work that investigates both connectivity and hop count of security-aware multi-hop AHWNs. Moreover, these characteristics of multi-hop AHWNs with colluding eavesdroppers are compared with those of multi-hop AHWNs with non-colluding eavesdroppers and without eavesdroppers. Simulation results show that putting more legitimate users does not greatly improve the quality of the multi-hop path in the non-colluding case compared with that in colluding case. Furthermore, the shape parameter of Nakagami fading has a more substantial effect on the connectivity and hop count than the spread parameter. The results in this paper provide valuable insights in designing and evaluating security-aware multi-hop AHWNs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."
770,n,Industrial Pervasive Edge Computing-Based Intelligence IoT for Surveillance Saliency Detection,"Numerous surveillance data processing is crucial in the Internet-of-Things systems with pervasive edge computing. In this process, salient object detection from surveillance videos plays an important role because it provides the human-concerned semantic cue for various industrial tasks. However, it is still challenging for the existing studies with two aspects. The first one is the redundant saliency information from moving background to disturb the detection of salient objects. The second one is the difficulty to model the spatiotemporal saliency uncertainty. To overcome these challenges. In this article, an intelligent approach is proposed for surveillance saliency detection. It enables a region-proposal-based optical flow strategy to suppress the saliency enhancement of non-salient regions due to the moving background. Besides, it develops the bidirectional Bayesian state transition strategy to model the motion uncertainty for refining the spatiotemporal saliency feature. Extensive experiments have been performed on two datasets (the increase of Fβ is larger than 0.01 for DAVIS, and larger than 0.015 for UVSD), and the comparison with seven methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.  © 2005-2012 IEEE."
771,n,Situational Anomaly Detection in Multimedia Data under Concept Drift,"Anomaly detection has been a very challenging and active area of research for decades, particularly for video surveillance. However, most of the works detect predefined anomaly classes using static models. These frameworks have limited applicability for real-life surveillance where the data have concept drift. Under concept drift, the distribution of both normal and anomaly classes changes over time. An event may change its class from anomaly to normal or vice-versa. The non-adaptive frameworks do not handle this drift. Additionally, the focus has been on detecting local anomalies, such as a region of an image. In contrast, in CCTV-based monitoring, flagging unseen anomalous situations can be of greater interest. Utilizing multiple sensory information for anomaly detection has also received less attention. This extended abstract discusses these gaps and possible solutions. © 2021 ACM."
772,n,Deriving adaptive long-term complementary operating rules for a large-scale hydro-photovoltaic hybrid power plant using ensemble Kalman filter,"The complementary operating rules of hydro-photovoltaic (PV) hybrid power plants have been explored fully to operate reservoirs for complementing the PV output. However, prevailing operating rules were constant, which is incapable to be dynamically updated based on new observations. To address this issue, adaptive complementary operating rules were developed to deal with the future uncertainties of reservoir inflow and solar radiation using ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). First, a long-term complementary optimization model was developed to derive the initial parameters of linear operating rules. Then, the optimal decisions under historical condition were used as the observation. Finally, six assimilation schemes were proposed, according to the two state transition equations (the same period of the previous year, the previous period) and three observations (the same period of the previous year, the previous period and their joint). China's Longyangxia hydro-PV hybrid power plant was chosen as a case study. Results show that (1) the two state transition equations have comparative effects on operation results, (2) the choice of observation plays a decisive role. The assimilation scheme, in which the optimal operation decision of the same period in previous year is as observation, outperforms the stationary operating rules. Specifically, the total power generation and guaranteed rate are improved by 7.14% and 5.33%, respectively, (3) the deriving framework works effectively under the synthetic nonstationary reservoir inflow and solar radiation, and ensures the stability and security of energy system in the changing environment. © 2021"
779,n,Attack-driven Test Case Generation Approach using Model-checking Technique for Collaborating Systems,"The formal verification technique of model-checking can be used to derive test cases. This approach has become popular as it provides the capabilities of exhaustively exploring the state space of the modeled system and generates counterexamples for properties specified over the model. However, counterexamples only show states, transitions and the values of their parameters. In addition, its semantics are also dependent on input model specification languages and trace representation notations. In this paper, we present a focused test case generation approach from PAT model checker for collaborating systems. The focus is driven by specific and putative attack behaviours. To this end, we devised test specification rules/algorithm to translate counterexamples to test cases. The translation aims at reducing semantic gaps between counterexamples and the corresponding test cases. We assess the viability of the test cases generated from our approach by using JADE simulation framework for aircraft landing scenario in air traffic control domain.  © 2021 IEEE."
783,n,Reliability and optimal triggering policy for multi-state systems subject to shocks and supported by a protective device,"Failures of safety-critical systems could result in irretrievable economic loss and significant environmental damage. To mitigate the failure risk of safety-critical systems, a protective device is commonly designed to alleviate the damage caused by external shocks. In this paper, a multi-state system subject to shocks and supported by a protective device is considered. The protective device can be triggered to defense valid shocks when the system state is worse than a predetermined threshold. During the operating process of the protective device, the system is assumed to be failure-free due to the resistant effect of the protective device. After resisting a finite number of valid shocks for the system, the protective device loses the protective ability. A finite Markov chain imbedding method is employed to derive the system reliability characteristics. Based on the established reliability model, the state based triggering policy of the protective device is designed and an optimization model is constructed to determine the optimal triggering threshold. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed model and obtained results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
784,n,Enabling self-adaptability of small scale and large scale security systems using dynamic partial reconfiguration,"The application areas of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are increasing due to its hardware acceleration and reprogrammable features. From large-scale computation systems like cloud, aerospace, and defence to small-scale computation systems like home automation and mobile phones, the dynamic partial reconfiguration property is found to be attractive to design adaptive systems for self-reconfiguration and self-healing. The article presents two self- adaptive security systems for small scale as well as for large-scale systems. The security system is designed to include encryption accelerators and hash code generation accelerators. The security system designed for small-scale systems saves space and power using hardware adaptation by loading or creating only the required accelerator during execution of the application. It uses light weight cryptographic algorithms. A second design for large-scale systems focuses on getting more throughput by allocating more resources to the required accelerator at runtime. Two designs are created for hardware adaptation based on the accelerator requirement at runtime. Proposed adaptive design for small-scale systems achieved 68.50% decrease in resource consumption and design for large-scale systems achieved 25.93% more throughput than the best existing implementations. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
797,n,NetBot-An Automated Router Hardening Solution for Small to Medium Enterprises,"Network security is of vital importance, and Information Technology admins must always be vigilant. But they often lack the expertise and skills required to harden the network properly, in with the emergence of security threats. The router plays a significant role in maintaining operational security for an organization. When it comes to information security, information security professionals mainly focus on protecting items such as firewalls, virtual private networks, etc. Routers are the foundation of any network's communication method, which means all the network information passes through the routers, making them a desirable target. The proposed automation of the router security hardening solution will immediately improve the security of routers and ensure that they are updated and hardened with minimal human intervention and configuration changes. This is specially focused on small and medium-sized organizations lacking workforce and expertise on network security and will help secure the routers with less time consumption, cost, and increased efficiency. The solution consists of four primary functions, initial configuration, vulnerability fixing, compliance auditing, and rollback. These focus on all aspects of router security in a network, from its configuration when it is initially connected to the network to checking its compliance errors, continuously monitoring the vulnerabilities that need to be fixed, and ensuring that the behavior of the devices is stable and shows no abnormalities when it comes to configuration changes.  © 2021 IEEE."
799,n,A polymorphic heterogeneous security architecture for edge-enabled smart grids,"The emergence of edge computing alleviates the network congestion, delay, and packet loss of cloud computing enabled smart grid architecture in big data scenarios, greatly improving the operation efficiency and communication quality of the smart grid. However, edge computing architecture also brings great security risks to the smart grid. This paper proposes a Polymorphic Heterogeneous Security Architecture (PHSA) for edge enabled smart grid, to assure the key services in the smart grid. Based on the dynamic heterogeneous redundancy architecture, the proposed architecture introduces intelligent scheduling of executors, intelligent arbitration of multi-state service response, cleaning and reconstruction of executors, and attack surface management. We establish a closed-loop core control process of decision and processing, adjustment and scheduling, cleaning reconstruction, migration, and recovery. Furthermore, a dynamic scheduling algorithm based on executor credit and heterogeneity is proposed. The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional smart grid security architecture, the PHSA has better defense ability and system reliability, significantly improving the security of edge enabled smart grid system. Besides, compared with the random scheduling strategy, the proposed dynamic executor scheduling algorithm can further improve the security of the system. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
818,n,Functional Encryption for Turing Machines with Dynamic Bounded Collusion from LWE,"The classic work of Gorbunov, Vaikuntanathan and Wee (CRYPTO 2012) and follow-ups provided constructions of bounded collusion Functional Encryption (FE) for circuits from mild assumptions. In this work, we improve the state of affairs for bounded collusion FE in several ways: 1.New Security Notion. We introduce the notion of dynamic bounded collusion FE, where the declaration of collusion bound is delayed to the time of encryption. This enables the encryptor to dynamically choose the collusion bound for different ciphertexts depending on their individual level of sensitivity. Hence, the ciphertext size grows linearly with its own collusion bound and the public key size is independent of collusion bound. In contrast, all prior constructions have public key and ciphertext size that grow at least linearly with a fixed bound Q.2.CPFE for circuits with Dynamic Bounded Collusion. We provide the first CPFE schemes for circuits enjoying dynamic bounded collusion security. By assuming identity based encryption (IBE), we construct CPFE for circuits of unbounded size satisfying non-adaptive simulation based security. By strengthening the underlying assumption to IBE with receiver selective opening security, we obtain CPFE for circuits of bounded size enjoying adaptive simulation based security. Moreover, we show that IBE is a necessary assumption for these primitives. Furthermore, by relying on the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumption, we obtain the first succinct CPFE for circuits, i.e. supporting circuits with unbounded size, but fixed output length and depth. This scheme achieves adaptive simulation based security.3.KPFE for circuits with dynamic bounded collusion. We provide the first KPFE for circuits of unbounded size, but bounded depth and output length satisfying dynamic bounded collusion security from LWE. Our construction achieves adaptive simulation security improving security of [20].4.KP and CP FE for TM/NL with dynamic bounded collusion. We provide the first KPFE and CPFE constructions of bounded collusion functional encryption for Turing machines in the public key setting from LWE. Our constructions achieve non-adaptive simulation based security. Both the input and the machine in our construction can be of unbounded polynomial length.We provide a variant of the above scheme that satisfies adaptive security, but at the cost of supporting a smaller class of computation, namely Nondeterministic Logarithmic-space (NL). Since NL contains Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA), this result subsumes all prior work of bounded collusion FE for uniform models from standard assumptions [7, 9]. © 2021, International Association for Cryptologic Research."
894,n,Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection System in RPL by Applying Stochastic and Evolutionary Game Models over IoT Environment,"The rapid development of Information and Communication Technology and the growing number of devices connected to the Internet make the Internet of Things (IoT) as a promising technology for a new breed of applications. The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a widely applied open standard protocol for IoT networks. The RPL routing is highly vulnerable to routing attacks due to the constrained nodes. The attacks on the RPL aim to disrupt the optimal protocol structure and significantly deteriorating network performance. Secure RPL routing schemes attempt to derive a high-level abstract of RPL operations through network simulation traces and apply it as a reference to differentiate the malicious behavior. The RPL specifications include all the states and transitions with its corresponding statistics. However, the malicious activities around a node enforce it to initiate the unnecessary state transition, and thus, the legitimate nodes are equally treated as malicious in dynamic IoT network scenarios. Hence, this work proposes a game theoretic model based anomaly Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect the RPL attacks and verify and confirm their malicious activities. This study formulates the Game models based Anomaly Intrusion Detection System (GAIDS) for RPL security. The proposed approach consists of two interrelated formulations, such as a stochastic game for attack detection and evolutionary game for attack confirmation. The stochastic game model formulates the activities of the standard RPL rules as a zero-sum stochastic game. The stochastic game estimates the payoff by observing the states, transitions between them, and their statistics. However, there is a possibility to model legitimate players as malicious, due to the nature of RPL. Thus, the proposed GAIDS scheme implements the evolutionary game theoretic framework on clustered network topology for the attack verification. By synchronizing the results of the stochastic game of neighboring players, it differentiates the legitimate players from the suspected list successfully. As a result, the GAIDS isolates the detected attackers and maintains the routing performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the detection accuracy and throughput of the proposed gaming model based anomaly IDS is substantially high and outperforms the existing scheme. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
904,n,Research on abnormal traffic diagnosis based on deployment mode of firewall,"The firewall based on quintuple for access control plays a very basic and vital role in network security protection, but the diversified firewall deployment mode also brings challenges to the network configuration: unreasonable network configuration may cause that the network traffic is interrupted, and when the interruption occurs, it is impossible to find the cause of the interruption if only analyzing the switching and routing involved in the network configuration. This article first analyzed the forwarding characteristics of traffic passing through the firewall, then proposed four types of firewall traffic forwarding models. No matter how the firewall deployment mode changes, the way of the traffic passes through the firewall must belong to one of the four models. This article further analyzed the four types of forwarding models based on the characteristics of firewalls, and found that three of them can cause abnormal firewall traffic. For this reason, this article proposed an algorithm for diagnosing abnormal models, and provided a solution based on network technology and firewall characteristics. © 2020 IEEE."
912,n,Resilience assessment of safety-critical systems with credal networks,"Nuclear accidents like Fukushima Daiichi or Three Mile Island have changed the safety paradigm to address not only the system failure but also the factors for safety. New nuclear power plant designs should consider safety parameters that maintain the operating conditions while coping with uncertain and possibly disruptive events. In other words, safety systems should increase the resilience of the nuclear power plants. In order to do so, resilience assessments must be carried out to study the system performance recovery once a disruptive event has occurred. The general process of resilience engineering comprises four states changing over time: reliability, unreliability, recovery and recovered steady-state. Probabilistic models like fault tree analysis, have been widely applied in the nuclear industry (among others) due to their flexibility to model complex engineering systems and uncertainty quantification of failure probabilities. However, such technique moderate the modeling scope when representing the interdependencies of the components in the system and variations in time over a disruption event. Moreover, additional complications in the resilience assessment process arise when considering the epistemic uncertainty due to the lack of knowledge about the events and the operating conditions. In this work, credal networks have been proposed for modeling complex interconnected systems as well as taking into account the epistemic uncertainty attached to the lack of data. The resilience assessment of the Main Heat Transport System together with key safety systems of an Advanced Thermal Reactor is carried out to evaluate the system recovery after a mishap adopting the credal network approach. The case study considers a heat removal system of a typical thermal reactor under high-pressure transients. This disruption event would activate the passive safety system to fulfill the reactor shut down process. The application of the proposed approach to producing a resilience analysis is described and results presented to demonstrate the applicability of the method. © ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers.Published by Research Publishing, Singapore."

One of the most beneficial aspects of IoT has emerged in the field of agriculture, wherewith the help of moisture and fertility sensor, the farmer can identify the need for fertilizer, quality of pesticides, quality of land, land moisture, and so on. Farmers can control the water distribution from home using smart sprinkling as well as pesticides sprinkling using IoT based drones. IoT makes use of light-weight communication with the motive of the reduction of extra overhead generated in regular internet communication. For to simplify and make faster communication IoT uses protocols like MQTT (Message queuing telemetry transport), COAP (Constrained Application Protocol), XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol), REST (Representational State Transfer) and so on. The most famous protocol in the IoT communication at the application layer is the MQTT protocol, which makes use of TCP as an underlying transport layer protocol for the transmission. TCP based interface makes it more reliable protocol as well as a small header of MQTT protocol makes it suitable for IoT Eco-system, In this chapter, We have discussed the IoT, industry 4.0, impact of IoT on industry 4.0, MQTT Protocol, MQTT security aspects, Survey on various protocols used for to make MQTT Communication in a secured manner. We have surveyed many recent advances that happened for the MQTT Security and list out significant challenges in the IoT based industry faces when it comes to securing devices from physical as well as logical attacks. MQTT based device authentication, access control of resources, and security of communicated data over the insecure channel are some of the significant challenges that are discussed in depth. Overall this chapter will contribute in-depth security survey of IoT based industry 4.0. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V."
923,n,State Transition Model (STM): An optimum solution for preventing co-resident DOS attacks in cloud infrastructure,"Co-occupant DoS assaults are discovered as most defenseless dangers in relation to distributed computing which is an asset and generally is obligatory in nature. Co-inhabitant DOS assaults would deplete out the cloud assets which impairs the certifiable cloud clients from executing cloud utilization. Consequently aversion and conclusion of the event related to co-inhabitant assaults results in fundamental assignment of cloud form. In our past research strategy, Two-Player Game Approach (TPGA) is acquainted which points that show evasion of co-inhabitant DOS assaults by learning and arranging the Virtual Machine requested from clients on account of the low, medium and high hazard demands. Anyway this strategy decreased in its execution regarding discovery of hazard dimension of client ask for VMs. There is no predefined method for recognizing hazard estimation of VM assets. And furthermore it would be troublesome keep up and refresh the hazard status data of the cloud assets. This is settled in the proposed research strategy by presenting the system called State Transition Model based defense mechanism (STM) or State Observation based Co-Resident DOS Attack Detection (SO-CRDOS-AD). In the proposed research technique at first hazard estimation of each asset dependent on client demands is assessed by utilizing hazard recognition metric. In light of this hazard metric esteem, state estimation of each client ask for as far as VM is refreshed. The states that are considered in this work are Security State, Vulnerability State, Attacked State, Positive State, Negative State, Degenerate State and Failure State. These state estimations of VM assets are refreshed occasionally with the assistance of Markov Chain display. This examination technique is actualized in the CloudSim condition from which it is demonstrated that the proposed research strategy can guarantee the exact recognition of assault status of VM asks for, therefore the security level can be upgraded. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

933,n,Adaptive Multi Model Architecture by Using Similarity between Trained User and New User,"Affective computing is a field of great interest in many applications, including video surveillance, behavior analysis, human robot interaction, life-logging. While accurately predicting these technologies (e.g. emotion estimation, confident for talking a topic) could have benefits for many fields, generic machine learning systems still yield low performance in some situation. We hypothesize that these sophisticated models suffer from individual differences of human's personality. Therefore, we proposed a multi characteristic model architecture which combine the personalized machine learning models and utilize each model 's prediction score in the inference. This architecture formed with reference to ensemble machine learning architecture. In this research, we presented the calculation method of weighted average in multi characteristic architecture by using similarity between a new sample and trained characteristics. We estimated confidence during communication as a human internal state. Empirical results demonstrate that using multi model trained each person 's information to account for individual differences provides improvements over traditional machine learning system and insight for dealing with various individual types. © 2019 IEEE."
942,n,Security implications of implementing multistate distance-bounding protocols,"A number of distance-bounding protocols have proposed multistate exchanges. In theory this can potentially improve the security of the protocol when using the same number of exchange rounds, i.e. as there are more than two states the probability of an attacker guessing a response correctly is lower. Similarly, for the same security probability, multistate distance-bounding protocols require less rounds. On the other hand, transmission errors during the timed exchange phase of the distance-bounding protocol also impact on the security of the protocol, as the verifier needs to allow a certain acceptance threshold of incorrect responses. This threshold causes False Acceptance and False Rejection in protocols and further influences the security of the protocol. In this paper, we investigate the security implications of multistate channel implementation and symbol energy considering their effect on the acceptance threshold. We show that implementing multistate responses using simple Mary modulation methods found in contactless devices, does not necessarily provide the expected security improvement when devices have finite transmission energy to spend on challenge-response exchanges. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery."
948,n,Pixel-based operating modes from surveillance videos for structural vibration monitoring: A preliminary experimental study,"This paper presents a practical and cost effective method for vibration monitoring using multiple surveillance cameras distributed throughout (within) a building structure. Robust feature points in surveillance footage are identified and tracked frame-by-frame (with the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi tracker) to extract the pixel motions. The relative pixel motions from multiple locations within the structure are analyzed in the frequency domain to estimate dynamic characteristics of the monitored structure (e.g., the dominant frequencies), as well as the pixel-based operating modes. These pixel-based modes importantly are in pixel units, eliminating the need to converted to engineering (physical) units. The method is verified through an experimental parametric study on a three-story lab-scale building structure (with three surveillance cameras) excited by broadband white noise signals. The accuracy and repeatability of the method are assessed to evaluate its application for structural health monitoring. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"
950,n,Characterizing Attacker Behavior in a Cybersecurity Penetration Testing Competition,Background: Inculcating an attacker mindset (i.e. learning to think like an attacker) is an essential skill for engineers and administrators to improve the overall security of software. Describing the approach that adversaries use to discover and exploit vulnerabilities to infiltrate software systems can help inform such an attacker mindset. Aims: Our goal is to assist developers and administrators in inculcating an attacker mindset by proposing an approach to codify attacker behavior in cybersecurity penetration testing competition. Method: We use an existing multimodal dataset of events captured during the 2018 National Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC'18) to characterize the approach a team of attackers used to discover and exploit vulnerabilities. Results: We collected 44 events to characterize the approach that one of the participating teams took to discover and exploit seven vulnerabilities. We used the MITRE ATTCK™ framework to codify the approach in terms of tactics and techniques. Conclusions: We show that characterizing attackers' campaign as a chronological sequence of MITRE ATTCK™ tactics and techniques is feasible. We hope that such a characterization can inform the attacker mindset of engineers and administrators in their pursuit of engineering secure software systems. © 2019 IEEE.
1004,n,A service oriented adaptive trust evaluation model for ubiquitous computing environment,"The increased participation of various devices and networks, involvement of heterogeneous system, and context-awareness raises a significance of trust and trust evaluation in the ubiqutioius computing environment. Consequently, the trust evaluation based on the context and service requirements is adapted to decide the applicable level of security to the offered services. Therefore, this paper presents a service-oriented adaptive trust evaluation model (SOATEM) in the ubiquitous computing network. The proposed trust evaluation model computes direct trust based on various interaction properties and recommendation trust by filtering the dishonest recommenders based on the time context. A balanced blending of direct and recommendation trust are done with trust weights to make them relevant to current application scenarios. The results are compared with some of the available schemes and found to be a consistently good in performance for the today’s ubiquitous network. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
1005,n,Adaptive security architecture for protecting RESTful web services in enterprise computing environment,"In this modern era of enterprise computing, the enterprise application integration (EAI) is a well-known industry-recognized architectural principle that is built based on loosely coupled application architecture, where service-oriented architecture (SOA) is the architectural pattern for the implementation of EAI, whose computational elements are called as “services.” Though SOA can be implemented in a wide range of technologies, the web services implementation of SOA becomes the current selective choice due to its simplicity that works on basic Internet protocols. Web service technology defines several supporting protocols and specifications such as SOAP and WSDL for communication with client and server for data interchange. A new architectural paradigm has emerged in SOA in recent years called REpresentational State Transfer (REST) that is also used to integrate loosely coupled service components, named RESTful web services, by system integration consortiums. This SOA implementation does not possess adequate security solutions within it, and its security is completely dependent on network/transport layer security that is obsolete owing to latest web technologies such as Web 2.0 and its upgraded version, Web 3.0. Vendor security products have major implementation constraints such as they need secured organizational environment and breach to SOA specifications, hence introducing new vulnerabilities. Herein, we examine the security vulnerabilities of RESTful web services in the view of popular OWASP rating methodologies and analyze the gaps in the existing security solutions. We hence propose an adaptive security solution for REST that uses public key infrastructure techniques to enhance the security architecture. The proposed security architecture is constructed as an adaptive way-forward Internet-of-Things (IoT) friendly security solution that is comprised of three cyclic parts: learn, predict and prevent. A novel security component named “intelligent security engine” is introduced which learns the possible occurrences of security threats on SOA using artificial neural networks learning algorithms, then it predicts the potential attacks on SOA based on obtained results by the developed theoretical security model, and the written algorithms as part of security solution prevent the SOA attacks. This paper is written to present one of such algorithms to prevent SOA attacks on RESTful web services along the discussion on the obtained results of the conducted proof-of-concept on the real-time SOA environment. A comparison of the proposed system with other competing solutions demonstrates its superiority. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
1013,n,Multi-mode cryptocurrency systems,"In the past years, the security of Bitcoin-like protocols has been intensively studied. However, previous investigations are mainly focused on the single-mode version of Bitcoin protocol, where the protocol is running among full nodes (miners). In this paper, we initiate the study of multi-mode cryptocurrency protocols. We generalize the recent framework by Garay et al. (Eurocrypt 2015) with new security definitions that capture the security of realistic cryptocurrency systems (e.g. Bitcoin with full and lightweight nodes). We provide the first rigorous security model for addressing the ""blockchain bloat"" issue. As an immediate application of our new framework, we analyze the security of existing blockchain pruning proposals for Bitcoin aiming to improve the storage efficiency of network nodes by pruning unnecessary information from the ledger. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery."
1043,n,Improving security with cognitive workflows,"Cloud Computing, SDN and virtual networking technologies have completely modified the relationship between the applications and the hardware resources that are used to execute them. They are no more tightly coupled to each other in a static context. However, elastic on-demand provisioning, auto-scaling and migration provided by cloud resources to address fluctuations in workload demands or available resource pools also bring with them new issues in managing security. In this paper, the authors propose a novel security system based on the concept of cognitive control overlay to proactively manage the security of service transactions. In particular, when the application components move, their configuration changes and the conventional intrusion detection systems (IDS) not aware of the mobility will fail. The cognitive overlay makes the IDS become aware of the mobility and take appropriate action. The solution addresses application security independent of server and network based security management systems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018."
1048,n,Disallowing unauthorized state changes of distributed shared objects,"Attaching digital signatures to state update messages in global distributed shared object (DSO) systems is not trivial. If the DSO consists of a number of autonomous local representative that use open, public networks for maintaining the state consistency, allowing a local representative to sign state update messages is not appropriate. More sophisticated schemes are required to prevent unauthorized state updates by malicious local representative or external parties. This paper examines the problem in detail, compares a number of possible solutions, and identifies the most suitable one and demonstrates how the state update messages can be signed using the identified solution. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2000."
1063,n,Anonymous CP-ABE against side-channel attacks in cloud computing,"Anonymous ABE is a promising primitive for enforcing fine-grained access control for the big data as well as preserving privacy of the users in Cloud Computing. However, traditional anonymous ABE schemes may not be secure in the real word due to the side-channel attacks. In addition, the existing anonymous ABE schemes are considered in the leak-free scenario assuming that secret keys are not leaked to the adversary. Thus, it is compelling to study the anonymity of ABE schemes in the context of key leakage attacks. Aiming at tackling the challenge above, an anonymous CP-ABE scheme against side-channel attacks in the bounded-leakage model is constructed. As a main technique tool, the dual system encryption technique is adopted. The proposed scheme uses LSSS as access structures and achieves adaptive security in the standard model. In addition, the results in simulation experiments indicate that the proposed scheme is efficient and practical. © 2017 Institute of Information Science. All rights reserved."
1073,n,The sleepy model of consensus,"The literature on distributed computing (as well as the cryptography literature) typically considers two types of players—honest players and corrupted players. Resilience properties are then analyzed assuming a lower bound on the fraction of honest players. Honest players, however, are not only assumed to follow the prescribed the protocol, but also assumed to be online throughout the whole execution of the protocol. The advent of “large-scale” consensus protocols (e.g., the blockchain protocol) where we may have millions of players, makes this assumption unrealistic. In this work, we initiate a study of distributed protocols in a “sleepy” model of computation where players can be either online (awake) or offline (asleep), and their online status may change at any point during the protocol. The main question we address is: Can we design consensus protocols that remain resilient under “sporadic participation”, where at any given point, only a subset of the players are actually online? As far as we know, all standard consensus protocols break down under such sporadic participation, even if we assume that 99 % of the online players are honest. Our main result answers the above question in the affirmative. We present a construction of a consensus protocol in the sleepy model, which is resilient assuming only that a majority of the online players are honest. Our protocol relies on a Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI), a Common Random String (CRS) and is proven secure in the timing model of Dwork-Naor-Sahai (STOC’98) where all players are assumed to have weakly-synchronized clocks (all clocks are within Δ of the “real time”) and all messages sent on the network are delivered within Δ time, and assuming the existence of sub-exponentially secure collision-resistant hash functions and enhanced trapdoor permutations. Perhaps surprisingly, our protocol significantly departs from the standard approaches to distributed consensus, and we instead rely on key ideas behind Nakamoto’s blockchain protocol (while dispensing the need for “proofs-of-work”). We finally observe that sleepy consensus is impossible in the presence of a dishonest majority of online players. © International Association for Cryptologic Research 2017."
1094,n,Power-aware design techniques of secure multimode embedded systems,"Nowadays, embedded systems have been widely usedin all types of application areas, some ofwhich belong to the safety and reliability critical domains. The functional correctness and design robustness of the embedded systems involved in such domains are crucial for the safety of personal/enterprise property or even human lives. Thereby, a holistic design procedure that considers all the important design concerns is essential. In this article, we approach embedded systems design from an integral perspective. We consider not only the classic real-time and quality of service requirements, but also the emerging security and power efficiency demands. Modern embedded systems are not any more developed for a fixed purpose, but instead designed for undertaking various processing requests. This leads to the concept of multimode embedded systems, in which the number and nature of active tasks change during runtime. Under dynamic situations, providing high performance along with various design concerns becomes a really difficult problem. Therefore, we propose a novel power-aware secure embedded systems design framework that efficiently solves the problem of runtime quality optimization with security and power constraints. The efficiency of our proposed techniques are evaluated in extensive experiments. © 2016 ACM."
1121,n,A web-based cooperative tool for risk management with adaptive security,"Risk management can benefit from Web-based tools fostering actions for treating risks in an environment, while having several individuals collaborating to face the endeavors related to risks. During the intervention, the security rules in place to preserve resources from unauthorized access, might need to be modified on the fly, e.g., increasing the privileges of risk managers or letting rescue teams view the exact position of the victims. Modifications should respect the overall security policies and avoid security conflicts. This paper presents a dynamic access control model for environmental risks involving physical resources. Data structures included in our Web application to represent both risk and security are given. To keep the dynamic security rules compliant with overall organization security objectives, we consider rules grouped in Access Control Domains so that changes do not create security conflicts during collaboration in risk management. Considering work environments as an example, risk and access control models are introduced. Security is built on the ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control) paradigm. A Risk Management System (RMS) is illustrated: it captures events, signals potential risks, and outputs strategies to prevent the risk. Dynamic authorization is included in the RMS to vary subjects' privileges on physical resources based on risk level, people position and so on. These concepts are implemented in a prototype Web application appearing as a Web Dashboard for risk management. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
1132,n,An active inference approach to on-line agent monitoring in safety-critical systems,"The current trend towards integrating software agents in safety-critical systems such as drones, autonomous cars and medical devices, which must operate in uncertain environments, gives rise to the need of on-line detection of an unexpected behavior. In this work, on-line monitoring is carried out by comparing environmental state transitions with prior beliefs descriptive of optimal behavior. The agent policy is computed analytically using linearly solvable Markov decision processes. Active inference using prior beliefs allows a monitor proactively rehearsing on-line future agent actions over a rolling horizon so as to generate expectations to discover surprising behaviors. A Bayesian surprise metric is proposed based on twin Gaussian processes to measure the difference between prior and posterior beliefs about state transitions in the agent environment. Using a sliding window of sampled data, beliefs are updated a posteriori by comparing a sequence of state transitions with the ones predicted using the optimal policy. An artificial pancreas for diabetic patients is used as a representative example. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
1162,n,Eadroid: Providing environment adaptive security for android system,"With the rapid popularization of Android system around the world, of the increase in Android malwares post serious threats to the security of users’ Android device and the privacy stored in it. At the same time, many trusted third party institutions (such as military, government institutions) need to customize the security policy of their Android devices according to their regulations, but most of them do not have this capability. This paper proposed an environment adaptive security mechanism for Android platform called EAdroid, which providing a simple way for trusted third party institutions to customize the security policy of their Android devices. EAdroid reforms the framework layer of Android system and synthetically applies Smack security module of Linux. At the same time, the security rules of framework layer and kernel layer in EAdroid can adapt to the current environment context. Series of tests show that EAdroid can efficiently protect the security of user’s devices and privacy with negligible overhead of performance. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014."
1170,n,Fault-tolerant timestamp-based two-phase commit protocol for RESTful services,"Service-oriented architecture provides interoperability and weak coupling features for software development. Representational state transfer (REST) is an architectural style that has attracted attention in the SOA domain as it allows the development of Web services based on original principles of the World Wide Web. Unlike Web service specifications, which are based on Simple Object Access Protocol and Web Services Description Language, REST does not provide 'official' standards to address non-functional requirements of services, such as security, reliability, and transaction control. The timestamp-based two-phase commit protocol for RESTful service (TS2PC4RS) algorithm specifies concurrency control of RESTful services during a transaction. An extension of the TS2PC4RS specifies the concurrency control of the Web services considering the update operation to meet some business rules. However, neither algorithm addresses transaction control when failures occur. In long-term transactions, failures can occur and compromise the success of Web service applications. Two common failures traditionally considered in the analysis of protocols are host and connection failures. The aim of this paper is to address fault tolerance for TS2PC4RS and its extension. A fault-tolerant protocol based on timeout and log records is proposed. The fault-tolerant protocol provides support for the host and connection failures that may occur during a transaction execution. The fault-tolerant mechanisms are used to meet the application domain business rules that guide the behavior of RESTful services. We describe the protocol using scenarios when failures occur.

1186,n,Feature selection filter for classification of power system operating states,The classification of power system operating states plays an important role in power system control and operation. Determining the state of a power system is crucial and requirements for real-time decision making in power system security assessment demand low dimensionality and low computational time. This paper investigates the benefits of using feature selection based on mutual information in power system state classification with machine learning. The AdaBoost algorithm is used for classification based on large training datasets and feature selection is applied in order to reduce their dimensionality. The selection is implemented as a filter in the pre-processing stage of AdaBoost and uses genetic algorithms to perform the search with the fitness function computed based on mutual information. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE New England 39-bus network and a comparison between the learning algorithm performances with and without feature selection is provided. Results for different genetic algorithm parameters are also presented. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With the traditional connectivity management in EPS/LTE accesses, security services such as confidentiality and integrity protection are designed to be activated in a systematic manner leading to significant signaling and processing cost. In this paper we are interested in looking at security implementation in EPS/LTE and evaluating the signaling load induced by security mechanisms in different situations. The aim of this study is to figure out how much signaling can be saved using an adaptive multi-level security scheme such as the one sketched-up in this paper. For this purpose, a novel quantitative analysis is carried out. The preliminary findings suggest that activating security mechanisms only when needed results in a significantly lower security-related signaling load. © 2013 IEEE."

1227,n,Security against hardware Trojan attacks using key-based design obfuscation,"Malicious modification of hardware in untrusted fabrication facilities, referred to as hardware Trojan, has emerged as a major security concern. Comprehensive detection of these Trojans during post-manufacturing test has been shown to be extremely difficult. Hence, it is important to develop design techniques that provide effective countermeasures against hardware Trojans by either preventing Trojan attacks or facilitating detection during test. Obfuscation is a technique that is conventionally employed to prevent piracy of software and hardware intellectual property (IP). In this work, we propose a novel application of key-based circuit structure and functionality obfuscation to achieve protection against hardware Trojans triggered by rare internal circuit conditions. The proposed obfuscation scheme is based on judicious modification of the state transition function, which creates two distinct functional modes: normal and obfuscated. A circuit transitions from the obfuscated to the normal mode only upon application of a specific input sequence, which defines the key. We show that it provides security against Trojan attacks in two ways: (1) it makes some inserted Trojans benign, i.e. they become effective only in the obfuscated mode; and (2) it prevents an adversary from exploiting the true rare events in a circuit to insert hard-to-detect Trojans. The proposed design methodology can thus achieve simultaneous protection from hardware Trojans and hardware IP piracy. Besides protecting ICs against Trojan attacks in foundry, we show that it can also protect against malicious modifications by untrusted computer-aided design (CAD) tools in both SoC and FPGA design flows. Simulation results for a set of benchmark circuits show that the scheme is capable of achieving high levels of security against Trojan attacks at modest area, power and delay overhead. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."
1239,n,Abstract certification of global non-interference in rewriting logic,"Non-interference is a semantic program property that assigns confidentiality levels to data objects and prevents illicit information flows from occurring from high to low security levels. In this paper, we present a novel security model for global non-interference which approximates non-interference as a safety property. We also propose a certification technique for global non-interference of complete Java classes based on rewriting logic, a very general logical and semantic framework that is efficiently implemented in the high-level programming language Maude. Starting from an existing Java semantics specification written in Maude, we develop an extended, information-flow Java semantics that allows us to correctly observe global non-interference policies. In order to achieve a finite state transition system, we develop an abstract Java semantics that we use for secure and effective non-interference Java analysis. The analysis produces certificates that are independently checkable and are small enough to be used in practice. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."

The reliability and safety function, computed from the transition probability of the Markov process, provides a proper quantitative measure of the fault tolerant control system because it incorporates the deadline, failure detection and fault isolation, permanent and correlated fault. State transition diagram was established based on the state transition of the system. State transition equation could be obtained by state transition diagram. Different state probability diagrams were acquired with different parameters of failure rate, recovery rate from transient fault, failure detection rate and fault isolation rate. © 2008 IEEE."
1316,n,Cooperative intrusion detection model based on scenario,"When a new intrusion means is developed, many intrusion methods can be derived by exchanging the command sequences or by replacing commands with the functionally similar commands, which makes the detection of the developed intrusion very difficult. To overcome this problem, a cooperative intrusion detection model based on scenario is proposed, which is consisted of 5 layers. Topological order, isomorphic transformation and state transition analysis method are applied in the text. For an intrusion case we generate all the possible derived intrusions as an intrusion base. Based on this intrusion base, we present an efficient method to detect such intrusions by using finite automaton. Further, we apply data fusion to analysis suspicious data. A derived intrusion can be seen as an unknown intrusion, in this sense the technique presented in this paper can detect some unknown intrusions. ©2007 IEEE."
1364,n,"A line in the sand: A wireless sensor network for target detection, classification, and tracking","Intrusion detection is a surveillance problem of practical import that is well suited to wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we study the application of sensor networks to the intrusion detection problem and the related problems of classifying and tracking targets. Our approach is based on a dense, distributed, wireless network of multi-modal resource-poor sensors combined into loosely coherent sensor arrays that perform in situ detection, estimation, compression, and exfiltration. We ground our study in the context of a security scenario called ""A Line in the Sand"" and accordingly define the target, system, environment, and fault models. Based on the performance requirements of the scenario and the sensing, communication, energy, and computation ability of the sensor network, we explore the design space of sensors, signal processing algorithms, communications, networking, and middleware services. We introduce the influence field, which can be estimated from a network of binary sensors, as the basis for a novel classifier. A contribution of our work is that we do not assume a reliable network; on the contrary, we quantitatively analyze the effects of network unreliability on application performance. Our work includes multiple experimental deployments of over 90 sensor nodes at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, FL, as well as other field experiments of comparable scale. Based on these experiences, we identify a set of key lessons and articulate a few of the challenges facing extreme scaling to tens or hundreds of thousands of sensor nodes. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

1381,n,Steady-state security prediction in presence of load uncertainty,"An important problem in the Electrical Power System operation is the steady-state security prediction. In order to take into account the load uncertainty, in this paper the authors apply a Monte-Carlo method together with an opportune Security Index to evaluate in a preventive manner the probability to fall in insecure operating state, by determining the security index probability density function. For this aim, in a previous paper proposed by the authors, it has been possible to take advantage of an Artificial Neural Network, trained to evaluate the Security Index probability density function in presence of the optimal economical dispatching of the generation powers for the load forecast. In the present paper, a more complex scenario is considered where the security analysis can suggest to the dispatcher to determine also non-optimal economical operating conditions to improve security. So a new, more complex, organization of the Artificial Neural Network training stage, necessary in order to obtain increased generalization capacity in the production stage, has been considered. In the first part of the paper the used security index, the Monte-Carlo simulation and the neural network structure with its learning algorithm utilized by the authors for the particular problem are briefly recalled. Finally, a numerical application on a simple electrical test system is shown pointing out very encouraging results."
1422,n,Reconfigurable trust for embedded computing platforms,"In the last couple of years, it has become obvious that embedded systems are integral parts of our every day lives. This omnipresence as well as the wireless nature of many embedded applications give rise to the need for sophisticated security and privacy preserving mechanisms. Trusted Computing is a promising new approach for computer security in which a system should be permanently in a well-defined and therefore trustworthy state. The adaption of such concepts for embedded systems with application specific requirements and limitations can provide promising security benefits. Besides, both in the industrial and academical sector a trend has become apparent to develop chips which include programmable cores as well as system reconfigurable components. Resultant chips will not be a single part of an embedded system anymore but rather can be used for the development of a whole system. Thus, FPGAs have become integral parts of embedded computing platforms. The reconfigurability of FPGAs offers major advantages when using them for cryptographic applications and it is suggested that an adaptive hardware-based trust anchor can greatly enhance the overall security level of an embedded system. In this paper we propose a concept of how such an adaptive security module could be designed as well as some possible fields of application. A key focus of this ongoing research work is the development of a flexible FPGA-based security architecture."
1470,n,A framework for protocol vulnerability condition detection,"Intrusion detection system (IDS) detects an intrusion by comparing with its attack signatures. The generation of IDS signatures is based on the analysis of attack traffic, which is a result of exploiting vulnerabilities in a network protocol. Thus, the protocol analysis becomes an effective method to find out protocol vulnerabilities with regard to IDS. But the problem of protocol analysis in IDS is that how to detect all protocol vulnerability conditions in protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to identify protocol vulnerability conditions by utilizing existing protocol analysis techniques. In particular,there are three major analysis steps in our framework: protocol semantic analysis, protocol implementation analysis and protocol state transition sub-condition analysis. In the final step of our framework, we illustrate the use of deletion, addition and modification operations with the purpose of generating all potential protocol vulnerability conditions from the normal protocol transition conditions. Experimental results show that this framework is encouraging and feasible."
1473,n,Effects of reliability and time pressure on unmanned aircraft systems operator performance,"Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are in the midst of aviation's next generation. UAS are being utilized at an increasing rate by military and security operations and are becoming widely popular in usage from search and rescue and weather research to homeland security and border patrol. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is currently working to define acceptable UAS performance standards and procedures for routine access for their use in the National Airspace System (NAS). This study examined the effects of system reliability and time pressure on unmanned aircraft systems operator performance and mental workload. Twenty-four undergraduate and graduate students, male and female, from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University participated in this study on a voluntary basis. The primary tasks were image processing time and target acquisition accuracy; three secondary tasks were concerned with responding to events encountered in typical UAS operations. Mental workload and trust levels of Multi-Modal Immersive Intelligent Interface for Remote Operation (MIIIRO) system were also studied and analyzed. System reliability was found to produce a significant effect for image processing time, while time pressure produced a significant effect for target acquisition accuracy. A significant effect was found for the interaction between system reliability and time pressure for pop-up threats re-routing processing time. The results were examined and recommendations for future research are discussed."
1474,n,"ITS implementation, the swedish way, ""interaction""","The congestion in our transport systems increases when the population in urban areas expands. The demand for effective and environmentally friendly transport will increase. Security is increasingly prioritized. Challenges are great and numerous for all modes of transport, Intelligent transport systems and services, ITS, offers many tools that can help to meet these. ITS's potential is great, and it is time that this was utilized. In 2010, the Government appointed a national ITS Board for the purpose of speeding up the process of introducing ITS in Sweden in order to reach the transport and industrial policy objectives. The ITS Board has three tasks: the first task is to develop forms of cooperation between public authorities and enterprise, the second task is to provide advice on and accelerate the Swedish Transport Administration and other authorities' process of implementing the action plan, ""Multi-modal strategy and action plan for the use of ITS"". The third task is to promote increased Swedish action in the EU in the area of ITS. At the same time, the Swedish Transport Administration received a government commission regarding a coordinating responsibility for the implementation and follow-up of the work in accordance with: ""Multi-modal strategy and action plan for the use of ITS1""."
1477,n,The architecture design for content-aware network security services,"With the ongoing increase of the network technologies' diversity and the integration of the user level applications, the legacy-style content-independent configuration of the security mechanisms cannot yields in efficient security solutions farther. Our work aims to contribute on the design of auto-reconfigurable (adaptive) security services that are capable to satisfy the application's security level required with minimal network resources' usage. In this paper we propose a new networkcentric security architecture design that relies on the current network security conditions and content-aware mechanisms. The architecture main functional blocks and the corresponding relationships are defined. This architecture shall supply three inter-domain composite user security services, named ""public traffic"", ""secret content"" and ""private communication"", as well as, attack source traceback and distributed access control functionalities."

And the proposed model determines dynamically security level and access control for the common resources. Therefore, it is supposed to provide appropriate security services according to the dynamic changes of the common resources."
1497,n,Ambient intelligence,"ABB's company, Busch-Jaeger Elektro GmbH, has launched easily programmable touch sensitive display units, combined with a range of motion sensitive switches and alarm units that can be incorporated into networks to control everything from music and lighting to blinds and security alarms. The units monitor human activity using infrared motion detectors, and each has a number of operating modes to satisfy the specific needs of its allocated area. Heating and cooling functions can be integrated into the system alongside lighting controls, with individual thermostat settings being specified via the central display unit. The application of video surveillance equipment takes security monitoring to a higher level, even allowing remote surveillance of properties. The system is inherently safe and can he installed with minimal disruption to existing services."
