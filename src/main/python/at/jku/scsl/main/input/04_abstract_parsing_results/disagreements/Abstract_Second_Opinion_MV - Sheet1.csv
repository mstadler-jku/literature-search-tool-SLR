researcher #3,516,A Novel Model of Mimic Defense Based on Minimal L-Order Error Probability,"Mimic defense is an active defense theory, which aims to fundamentally change the “easy to attack and difficult to defend” situation of network security. In this paper, we propose an evaluation method based on the probability of being attack successfully, and improve the evaluation scheme of historical confidence. We combine the two evaluation schemes with the TOPSIS (technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution) algorithm, and finally form a complete heterogeneous variant dynamic scheduling model. Different from traditional multi-mode voting algorithms, the effect of the heterogeneous degree in voting is considered, and we use Bayesian estimation to obtain the optimal result in the probabilistic sense. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively enhance the dynamic and security of the mimic defense model, and give full play to the characteristics of mimic defense.",N,Very formal; don't think this can help us in the SLR,sounds / looks exrremly formal - with just the algorithm

researcher #3,551,Studying Advanced Firewalls,"A Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) is a security device that combines a firewall, an antivirus, an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and VPN functionalities. This chapter focuses on ASA models, modes of using ASA equipment, and an overview of ASA 5505. It discusses the types of ASA licenses, and configuring of the interfaces, DHCP service, ACLs, network address translation (NAT) service, and AAA. The chapter also discusses the configuring of Cisco devices using the Cisco Configuration Professional and Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) graphic tools. There are different models of ASAs. All the models offer advanced firewall and VPN functionalities. The biggest difference between the models is the maximal flow of traffic that can be managed by each model and the number and the types of interfaces. An ASA model is chosen based on the requirements of an organization such as the flow, maximal connections per second and the company's budget.",N,,does not really say anyhting about modes... and seems to be the opposite of above very specific and tailored to a specific firewall
researcher #3,601,Safe and Automatic Live Update for Operating Systems,"Increasingly many systems have to run all the time with no downtime allowed. Consider, for example, systems controlling electric power plants and e-banking servers. Nevertheless, security patches and a constant stream of new operating system versions need to be deployed without stopping running programs. These factors naturally lead to a pressing demand for live update---upgrading all or parts of the operating system without rebooting. Unfortunately, existing solutions require significant manual intervention and thus work reliably only for small operating system patches.In this paper, we describe an automated system for live update that can safely and automatically handle major upgrades without rebooting. We have implemented our ideas in Proteos, a new research OS designed with live update in mind. Proteos relies on system support and nonintrusive instrumentation to handle even very complex updates with minimal manual effort. The key novelty is the idea of state quiescence, which allows updates to happen only in safe and predictable system states. A second novelty is the ability to automatically perform transactional live updates at the process level, ensuring a safe and stable update process. Unlike prior solutions, Proteos supports automated state transfer, state checking, and hot rollback. We have evaluated Proteos on 50 real updates and on novel live update scenarios. The results show that our techniques can effectively support both simple and complex updates, while outperforming prior solutions in terms of flexibility, security, reliability, and stability of the update process.",N,,imho related to mode switching but probably too far of what the SLR scope should be?

researcher #3,649,Reinforced practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol for cyber physical systems,"Cyber–physical systems (CPS) are becoming an essential component of modern life. CPS services enable information to be exchanged between physical devices and virtual systems. The increasing malicious activities causing confidential data leakage and incorrect performance of devices are posing challenges for protection against cyber threats. Therefore, development of effective solutions that can protect both CPS data and data exchange networks are extremely urgent. This study makes some improvements on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and provides a critical analysis of the feasibility of using blockchain technology to protect constrained CPS data. It also justifies the choice of the improved PBFT for implementation on such devices and simulates the main distributed ledger scenarios. The improved PBFT works as follows: first, the client broadcasts the signed transaction data to the entire network, rather than just the master node, followed by a hash value comparison verification process; second, select the master node based on the longest chain principle, and punish the malicious node via the “blacklist” mechanism; third, add the data synchronization and verification process, as well as dynamically entering and leaving nodes via state transitions. Ultimately, the PBFT commit phase is eliminated, resulting in a two-stage process. In comparison to the original PBFT protocol, the Reinforced Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (RPBFT) protocol may substantially enhance system throughput and minimize consensus communication time, thereby improving overall system efficiency while guaranteeing security. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",N,Don' think this is relevant; there is no description of attack mitigation,
researcher #3,689,Detection and robustness evaluation of android malware classifiers,"Android malware attacks are tremendously increasing, and evasion techniques become more and more effective. For this reason, it is necessary to continuously improve the detection performances. With this paper, we wish to pursue this purpose with two contributions. On one hand, we aim at evaluating how improving machine learning-based malware detectors, and on the other hand, we investigate to which extent adversarial attacks can deteriorate the performances of the classifiers. Analysis of malware samples is performed using static and dynamic analysis. This paper proposes a framework for integrating both static and dynamic features trained on machine learning methods and deep neural network. On employing machine learning algorithms, we obtain an accuracy of 97.59% with static features using SVM, and 95.64% is reached with dynamic features using Random forest. Additionally, a 100% accuracy was obtained with CART and SVM using hybrid attributes (on combining relevant static and dynamic features). Further, using deep neural network models, experimental results showed an accuracy of 99.28% using static features, 94.61% using dynamic attributes, and 99.59% by combining both static and dynamic features (also known as multi-modal attributes). Besides, we evaluated the robustness of classifiers against evasion and poisoning attack. In particular comprehensive analysis was performed using permission, APIs, app components and system calls (especially n-grams of system calls). We noticed that the performances of the classifiers significantly dropped while simulating evasion attack using static features, and in some cases 100% of adversarial examples were wrongly labelled by the classification models. Additionally, we show that models trained using dynamic features are also vulnerable to attack, however they exhibit more resilience than a classifier built on static features. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",N,This is only a evaluation of the systems but does not provide a new solution to the topic,
researcher #3,725,Adaptive security control of time-varying constraints nonlinear cyber-physical systems with false data injection attacks,"In this article, an adaptive security control scheme is presented for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) suffering from false data injection (FDI) attacks and time-varying state constraints. Firstly, an adaptive bound estimation mechanism is introduced in the backstepping control design to mitigate the effect of FDI attacks. Secondly, to solve the unknown sign time-varying state-feedback gains aroused by the FDI attacks, a type of Nussbaum function is employed in the adaptive security control. Then, by constructing a barrier Lyapunov function, it can be ensured that all signals of controlled system are bounded and the time-varying state constraints are not transgressed. Finally, the provided simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. © 2022 Northeastern University, China.",N,Not an adaptive general mechanism but rather a very (too) specific application,
researcher #3,736,Monitoring Cyber-Physical Systems Using a Tiny Twin to Prevent Cyber-Attacks,"We propose a method to detect attacks on sensors and controllers in cyber-physical systems. We develop a monitor that uses an abstract digital twin, Tiny Twin, to detect false sensor data and faulty control commands. The Tiny Twin is a state transition system that represents the observable behavior of the system from the monitor point of view. At runtime, the monitor observes the sensor data and the control commands, and checks whether the observed data and commands are consistent with the state transitions in the Tiny Twin. The monitor produces an alarm when an inconsistency is detected. We model the components of the system and the physical processes in the Rebeca modeling language and use its model checker to generate the state space. The Tiny Twin is built automatically by reducing the state space, keeping the observable behavior of the system, and preserving the trace equivalence. We demonstrate the method and evaluate it in detecting attacks using a temperature control system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Y,,could be in scope (I think its also ok to exclude papers later - when doing the extraction - notificing that it is in fact out of scope or does not contain enough info
researcher #3,790,Edge Network Security Risk Control Based on Attack and Defense Map,"The standardized communication protocol and the universal application of intelligent electronic devices in edge networks provide technical support to the realization of smart cities and also bring network security issues that cannot be ignored. How to analyze and quantitatively assess the vulnerability of the edge network has become an important issue that needs to be solved urgently in the edge network security risk control. Based on the analysis of the vulnerability mechanism, this paper proposes the selection criteria and generation methods of vulnerability indicators and of composite vulnerability indicators, respectively. In addition, this paper proposes an improved vulnerability severity rating method to analyze the vulnerability of the system and potential security threats. This paper describes the security risk status of vulnerable points based on the state transition of the state offensive and defensive graph and implements the description of the security risk status of attacks in terms of attack frequency, attack success rate and harm.

researcher #3,827,New Dataset for Industry 4.0 to Address the Change in Threat Landscape,"Because of its connectivity and its convergence with the IT world, industry 4.0 has become one of the main target sectors of the attackers. These last few years, they improve their operating mode and hit with more sophisticated attacks. Anomaly-based Intrusions Detection Systems (IDS) use datasets to train the classification algorithms they use to detect these attacks. Their detection capacity is therefore strongly linked to the representativeness of these datasets and the attacks they address. Actually, few datasets focus on the specificities of Industry 4.0 and even less propose a realistic labeled dataset. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to propose an industrial labeled dataset. It is characterized by several novelties consisting firstly in the fact that this data adds application features related to the industrial protocol Modbus. Then, it simulates twelve IT and OT attacks in a real environment. And finally in the labelling process, it contains 3 labels: one to characterize normal traffic, another for abnormal traffic and a specific label to distinguish the equipment reaction against an attack from the other types of data. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",N,strongly advocate for exclusion; this is just a dataset and no solution system,
researcher #3,969,An adaptive security approach according to the reliability level of drones using blockchain,"In drone environments using batteries, it is important to reduce unnecessary overhead. Also, for security of data, encryption is also an important factor. However, in the case of encryption, overhead is generated, but encryption and overhead are always in a trade-off relationship in this way. In this paper, in order to reduce overhead of drone, the concept of reliability was applied. We applied low level security to drone with high reliability to reduce overhead and conversely applied high level security to drone with low reliability. In order to adjust the security level, adjust the size of Key used for encryption and reduce the weight of the security algorithm itself. The reliability of the drone was determined based on the number of times of receiving data and by applying group reliability through drone grouping, it was made possible to determine hierarchical reliability. Moreover, by storing the communication records of all drones in the blockchain, the integrity of the reliability is guaranteed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.",N,strongly advocate for exclusion; the determination of reliabaility is no solution for the topic of adaptive security measures,
researcher #3,994,New Lightweight Architectures for Secure FSM Design to Thwart Fault Injection and Trojan Attacks,"Finite state machine (FSM) is a critical part in digital processing devices used in Internet of Things (IoT) applications as it controls complete functionality of the device. The synthesis tool implements deterministic FSM by adding extra don’t care states/transitions during optimization. This additional insertion makes the FSM vulnerable to setup-time violation based fault injection (STVFI) and hardware Trojan attacks. The existing techniques are inefficient to completely mitigate these vulnerabilities and exhibit significant design overhead. Therefore, this paper presents a novel lightweight secure machine design technique that completely mitigates the vulnerabilities with minimum overhead. The paper first proposes a new metric to identify all types of vulnerable transitions (VTs) followed by a trustworthy FSM design algorithm and efficient vulnerability mitigation architecture (EVMA). Though our EVMA completely alleviates the vulnerabilities to STVFI and Trojan attacks, it slightly increases the overhead due to additional multiplexers. Hence, we also propose new secure FSM design algorithm and two new lightweight vulnerability mitigation architectures (LVMA-I and LIVMA-II) that control the FFs using existing clear and/or preset pins instead of multiplexers. The experimental results on AES and RSA encryption modules show that the proposed technique detects 100% VTs. Further, ASIC and FPGA implementation of the proposed LIVMA-II using Cadence RTL and Xilinx Vivado presents on an average 40%, 59.6%, and 51.1% reduced area, power and delay respectively compared to the well-known technique. Due to negligible design overhead, our technique is best suitable for designing secure controller of portable IoT devices. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",N,,
researcher #3,996,Defensive strategy selection based on attack-defense game model in network security,"Security analysis and attack-defense modeling are effective methods to identify the vulnerabilities of information systems for proactive defense. The attack graph model reflects only attack actions and system state changes, without considering the perspective of the defenders. To assess the network information system and comprehensively show attack and defense strategies and their cost, a defense graph model is proposed. Compared with the attack graph, the model makes some improvements. The defense graph will be mapped to the attack and defense game model, in order to provide a basis for active defense policy decision. Moreover, a generation algorithm of defense graph is proposed. A representative example is provided to illustrate our models and demonstrate the high efficiency of the algorithm. © 2018 Totem Publisher, Inc. All rights reserved.",Y,,
researcher #3,1001,Verifying the long-run behavior of probabilistic system models in the presence of uncertainty,"Verifying that a stochastic system is in a certain state when it has reached equilibrium has important applications. For instance, the probabilistic verification of the long-run behavior of a safety-critical system enables assessors to check whether it accepts a human abortcommand at any time with a probability that is sufficiently high. The stochastic system is represented as probabilistic model, a long-run property is asserted and a probabilistic verifier checks the model against the property. However, existing probabilistic verifiers do not account for the imprecision of the probabilistic parameters in the model. Due to uncertainty, the probability of any state transition may be subject to small perturbations which can have direct consequences for the veracity of the verification result. In reality, the safety-critical system may accept the abort-command with an insufficient probability. In this paper, we introduce the first probabilistic verification technique that accounts for uncertainty on the verification of longrun properties of a stochastic system. We present a mathematical framework for the asymptotic analysis of the stationary distribution of a discrete-time Markov chain, making no assumptions about the distribution of the perturbations. Concretely, our novel technique computes upper and lower bounds on the long-run probability, given a certain degree of uncertainty about the stochastic system. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",N,strongly advocate for exclusion; a formal verification is not what we look for in the SLR,
researcher #3,1020,A stochastic game for adaptive security in constrained wireless body area networks,"Using Internet of Things (IoT) in the health domain is one of the most promising approaches which offer a ubiquitous healthcare where sensors are used, in real time, for constant monitoring of patient's symptoms and needs wherever he is. Wireless body area network (WBAN) is a highly suitable communication tool for the medical IoT devices. However, the conception of WBAN applications is still a challenging job that should take into consideration many technical requirements such as network lifetime, security level, network throughput and data criticality and prioritization. As a consequence, a trade-off between security effectiveness, energy efficiency, and QoS requirements can be perceived as a major performance objective. In this paper, we propose a stochastic game to balance the tradeoff between network performance and security level while taking into account the context dynamics. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can achieve an acceptable security level and is more efficient than benchmark algorithms in terms of network lifetime and throughput. © 2018 IEEE.",N,,
researcher #3,1029,Towards a novel protocol analysis framework for industrial control systems,"Nowadays industrial controls systems (ICS) are becoming more and more robust and intelligent, owing to the development of industrial networking technology. While, on the other hand, security issues arise and pose great challenges. Among these issues, the security of ICS protocols receives the attention from both academy and industry in recent years. Due to the close and proprietary nature of industrial protocols, it is difficult to conduct protocol analysis and protection on these protocols. To address this issue, we propose a novel protocol analysis framework, named ICS-PAS, for ICS protocols. ICS-PAF could differentiate unknown protocols and their command types, extract protocol format and recognize the data types of protocol payloads. In addition, ICS-PAF could also infer and model the state transition of ICS protocols. ICS-PAS requires no prior knowledge and could deal with binary protocols. We also conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the performance of ICS-PAS. The results show that ICS-PAS outperforms traditional approaches in terms of recognition accuracy and efficiency. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",N,"strongly advocate for exclusion; this paper is included because of the term ""state-transistions"" but provides no solution system",
researcher #3,1082,"A lightweight, adaptive security mechanism","Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) allow vehicles to exchange information with other vehicles [vehicle to vehicle (V2V)] and with nearby roadside infrastructures [vehicle to infrastructure (V2I)] in real time, thus providing a number of value-added services to create a safer and more efficient traffic environment [59]. Due to factors closely related to driving safety and even potential life risk, VANETs impose stringent conditions on communication quality and security protection for timely and reliable information dissemination. Unlike the traditional wired network, VANETs are characterized by numerous new features, e.g., quick movement and unstable channel. These characteristics cause many challenging issues and limitations, e.g., bandwidth shortage, latency sensitivity, and serious Doppler effects, all of which make simultaneously harmonizing quality of service (QoS) and security difficult. To address these technical issues in an organizational way, European Telecommunications 188Standards Institute/International Organization for Standardization (ETSI/ISO) jointly proposed a horizontal/vertical mixture as the intelligent transport systems (ITS) station reference architecture. Such elaborate design structure enables the joint optimization of two seemingly conflicting topics of the communication quality and security and facilitates the redesign of the related protocols and controlling algorithms to optimally utilize the restrictive resources. © 2017 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Y,,

researcher #3,1441,A game theoretic approach for responding to cyber-attacks on nuclear power plants,"As digital systems are being more widely employed in nuclear power plants, the potential for serious consequences caused by cyber-attacks on the plants has drawn increasing attention to cyber-security issues in the nuclear industry. Current practices focus on strategies for preventing cyber-attacks, while little research has been done on how to respond to cyber-attacks when they are detected. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic approach for responding to cyber-attacks on nuclear power plants. The interaction between the defender and the attacker is modeled as a two-player, nonzero-sum, stochastic game, which generalizes both Markov decision processes (MDP) and repeated games. We propose an approach for identifying system states and state transitions, and apply probabilistic risk assessment to obtain credible transition probabilities between system states under the action pair of defender and attacker. The Nash Equilibrium of the game provides the valid prediction of both players' actions because no single player can benefit from unilaterally deviating from the equilibrium policy if the other player adheres to his/hers, hence it provides the best response of the defender to cyber-attacks. Dynamic programming represents the long-term cumulative utility in a recursive form and we form an equivalent nonlinear program to derive the equilibrium. As a case study, the proposed approach is applied to a simplified benchmark digital feedwater control system. The modeling of the system is presented, and discussions on both the equilibrium policy and state values obtained are provided. © 2018 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC All Rights Reserved",Y,,
