researcher #1,96,Privacy-Preserving Medical Treatment System Through Nondeterministic Finite Automata,"In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving medical treatment system using nondeterministic finite automata (NFA), hereafter referred to as P-Med, designed for remote medical environment. P-Med makes use of the nondeterministic transition characteristic of NFA to flexibly represent medical model, which includes illness states, treatment methods and state transitions caused by exerting different treatment methods. A medical model is encrypted and outsourced to cloud to deliver telemedicine service. Using P-Med, patient-centric diagnosis and treatment can be made on-the-fly while protecting the confidentiality of patientâ€™s illness states and treatment recommendation results. Moreover, a new privacy-preserving NFA evaluation method is given in P-Med to get a confidential match result for the evaluation of an encrypted NFA and an encrypted data set, which avoids the cumbersome inner state transition determination. We demonstrate that P-Med realizes treatment procedure recommendation without privacy leakage to unauthorized parties. We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to evaluate the efficiency.",n
