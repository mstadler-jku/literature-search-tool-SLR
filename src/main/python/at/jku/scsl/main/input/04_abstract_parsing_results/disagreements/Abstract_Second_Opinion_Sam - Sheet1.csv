researcher #2,146,Attack Detection and Mitigation for Sensor and CAN Bus Attacks in Vehicle Anti-lock Braking Systems,"For a modern vehicle, if a sensor in the vehicle Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) or the controller area network (CAN) bus is attacked during a brake process, the vehicle will lose driving direction control and driver's life will be highly threatened. However, current methods for detecting attacks are not sufficiently accurate and no methods can provide attack mitigation. To ensure vehicle ABS security, we propose an attack detection method to accurately detect both sensor attack and CAN bus attack in a vehicle ABS, and an attack mitigation strategy to mitigate their negative effects on the vehicle ABS. In our attack detection method, we build a vehicle state space equation which considers real-time road friction coefficient to predict vehicle states (i.e., wheel speed and longitudinal brake force) with their previous values. Based on sets of historical measured vehicle states, we develop a search algorithm to find out attack changes (vehicle state changes because of the attack) by minimizing errors between predicted vehicle states and measured vehicle states. In our attack mitigation strategy, attack changes are subtracted from measured vehicle states to generate correct vehicle states for the vehicle ABS. We conducted first real sensor attack experiments to show how a magnet affects sensor readings. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack detection method can detect sensor attack and CAN bus attack more accurately compared with existing methods, and also our attack mitigation strategy almost eliminates attack's effects on the vehicle ABS.",y,
researcher #2,245,Security in Underwater Sensor Network,"Underwater wireless sensor network is a novel type of underwater networked system. Due to the characteristics of UWSN and underwater channel, UWSN are vulnerable to malicious attacks. The existing security solutions proposed for WSN cannot be used directly in UWSN. Moreover, most of these solutions are layer wise. In this paper, we studied the threat, attack, and security issues of UWSN. Subsequently, we argue that layered security schemes cannot protect UWSN against blended attacks. Additionally, we presented a novel preliminary conceive, which is a cross-layer, adaptive, selective security scheme.",n,The layers refer to the ISO/OSI layers… So not like layers to switch in between and also I think the topic is rather far away from the modes concept
researcher #2,316,End-to-end security in the presence of intelligent data adapting proxies: the case of authenticating transcoded streaming media,"We consider the problem of maintaining end-to-end security in the presence of intelligent proxies that may adaptively modify data being transmitted across a network. The video coding community considers this problem in the context of transcoding media streams, but their approaches either fail to address authentication or fail to provide meaningful security guarantees. We present two provably-secure schemes, LISSA and TRESSA, that allow an intelligent network intermediary to intercept a stream signed by a content provider, and adapt it dynamically, while preserving the ultimate receiver's ability to securely verify the content provider's signature (and, hence, authenticity and integrity of the data received). Our schemes allow the intermediary to selectively remove portions of the stream and, thus, permit common media transcoding techniques such as scalable compression and multiple file switching. Moreover, a content provider only has to encode and sign its entire data stream once, as opposed to nondynamically encoding and signing different versions for each anticipated combination of device, network configuration, and channel condition. Our implementation results demonstrate efficiency.",n,Too far away from Modes concept. I don't see how adapting a stream signature could help us for the SLR
researcher #2,616,Incorporating Security Features in Service-Oriented Architecture Using Security Patterns,"Service-Oriented Architecture is an architectural style where different heterogeneous components share information with each other by using special types of messages based on the protocol known as Simple Object Access Protocol. Various technologies, such as Common Object Request Broker Architecture, Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, Java Message Service etc. are applied to realize Service-Oriented Architecture for different applications. Besides these approaches, two other techniques, REpresentational State Transfer, and web services are applied for the realization of Service-Oriented Architecture. Web services provide a platform independent communication scheme between applications. The security preservation among the composition of services is an important task for Service-Oriented Architecture. In this study, an attempt is made to incorporate security features in Service- Oriented Architecture with the help of software security patterns. This scheme is described by developing an architectural model integrated with security goals and security patterns. The structural and behavioral aspects of composition of web services incorporated with security features are presented using a Unified Modeling Language class diagram and a sequence diagram respectively. At the end of this study, an evaluation is performed between identified security patterns and critical security properties along with Service-Oriented Architecture design principles. A case study of an online banking system is considered to explain the use of security patterns.",n,Abstract says nothing towards security modes concept
researcher #2,865,Application design phase risk assessment framework using cloud security domains,"Security risk assessment is done to identify the vulnerabilities of a client's application and develop strong security measures within budgetary constraints. However, while migrating to the Cloud platform, a generic notion of their publicly available security policies make it challenging for clients to assess the security threats solely relevant to their applications. Additionally, traditional risk assessment techniques cannot address these challenges as they neither consider cloud security domains as assessment criteria nor identifies critical system resources that need to be protected in the likelihood of a successful attack. In order to address these challenges, this paper presents a risk assessment framework for clients’ applications that is characterized by the inclusion of cloud security metrics to perform risk assessment during the design phase of an application by incorporating the techniques of cloud misuse patterns. It also helps improve the security requirements phase that precedes risk assessment, by illustrating clients how different attack scenarios can spread through the applications by using the concepts of percolation centrality and probabilistic state transition diagrams. One of the key findings this work address is how to systematically gain a distinction between multiple system resources belonging to the same security defense priority level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",n,"I strongly advocate for exclusion, since the risk assessment has nothing to do with security adaptation when under attack"
researcher #2,897,"Security tokens: architecture, smart contract applications and illustrations using SAFE","Purpose: Blockchain technologies have pervaded modern crowdfunding and capital sourcing through a variety of financial instruments implemented as smart contracts. Smart contracts provide a unique mechanism not only to create a unique one-of-a-type financial instrument, but also to enable unique innovations atop existing financial instruments due to underlying efficiencies. The smartness comes from the flexibility that programs provide which can create extremely unique financial instruments that are often complex to implement, yet easy to create, maintain through versioning, trade and destroy. The purpose of this paper is to describe the security token architecture as an application of smart contracts. Further, the author illustrates the implementation and design of a commonly used financial instrument known as Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) using the security token architecture proposed and smart contract functionality. The author then models the transaction using relational algebra, and, models the utility maximization. The author shows how on account of reduced information asymmetry between the investors and SAFE users (i.e. startups) utility is positive when smart contract-based security tokens are deployed for each state in the SAFE contract. Design/methodology/approach: Using an existing well-adopted instrument called a SAFE contract, the author illustrates the architecture of a smart contract-based security token system. The author illustrates how different components of a SAFE contract can be implemented as a smart contract and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of applying blockchain-based smart contracts to design SAFE instruments. The author deploys two methods: a state space diagram to explain state transitions and a utility model to explain the utilities. Findings: The key findings of this research study are the design of a security token architecture, which can be used to convert any the physical or contract-based financial instrument to a smart contract that runs on the blockchain. However, there are limitations to the implementation of the same which can be overcome. The model illustrates the positive utilities derived for all economic actors, i.e. the contractors, the utility providers, etc., in the market. Originality/value: This paper is an original paper. For the very first time, the author explored the architecture of a security token system. Using a well-known financial instrument, namely the SAFE, the author describes various components, e.g. the four contracts that form SAFE and then model the utilities for the system. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",n,"Not relevant in my opinion; The state transitions in the realm of this concept are used for converting, but not in the security sense we think of"
researcher #2,1151,Adaptive security for risk management using spatial data,"This paper presents the design principles for adaptive security for areas where changing conditions trigger events signaling risks that might require modifying authorizations of risk management teams. Spatial resources and information of the areas to be protected are considered in sample scenarios, and principles of security design are introduced building on ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control). Adaptivity of security rules applying to subjects who intervene in the risk area is the core of our security model so as to make it responsive to risks by dynamically granting privileges to subjects to access resources. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",y,
researcher #2,1197,Modeling and checking the security of DIFC system configurations,"Decentralized information flow control (DIFC) systems provide strong protection for data secrecy and integrity. However, the complicated configuration of information flow between system objects increases the chance of misconfiguration, making the system vulnerable to attackers. In this paper we first present a systematic analysis of misconfigurations and their security threats for DIFC systems. Then we define the security analysis problem for DIFC configurations based on a formal state-transition model, which allows model checkers to prove a configuration is secure or detect misconfigurations that violate the desired security goal. The experiment shows that bounded model checking techniques plus a novel preprocessing algorithm are effective in solving this problem. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.",n,Don't see relevance; Proving that a configuration is not secure is not the dynamic we are looking for; It would be relevant if the configs can be reconfigured at runtime or during attack
researcher #2,1231,CaPaS: An optimal security-aware cache replacement algorithm for cluster storage systems,"In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic cache management approach, i.e., a cache partitioning system (CaPaS), to optimise security levels in contemporary cluster storage systems for data-intensive applications with acceptable disk response times. CaPaS utilises an adaptive security control mechanism to adjust for varying workload conditions initiated by client-issued disk requests as well as security requirements and contains a cache partitioning scheme, a response-time estimator, and an adaptive security quality controller. The CaPaS algorithm solves a non-linear optimisation problem to increase the quality of security of disk requests in cluster storage systems while ensuring the disk requests to be completed within their desired response times. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been tested with the newly defined performance indicators on a cluster storage system including CaPaS, eight cryptographic and seven integrity services. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the CaPaS algorithm improves the overall system performance enormously over two traditional baseline cache management algorithms. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",n,
researcher #2,1371,Autonomic protection system using adaptive security policy,"There are various techniques to safeguard computer systems and networks against illegal actions. Secure OS based on Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the systems that reflect these techniques. The RBAC system controls access to system resources based on roles. Recently, many systems employ more fine-grained access control on system resources to enhance system security. However, this approach in access control level may cause unexpected problems, since most systems acquire system resources through system call that is hooked on kernel. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The proposed Autonomic Protection System (APS) supports fine-grained intrusion detection. It resides above Secure OS based on RBAC that provides general-grained access control. The system detects intrusions using security policy based on RBAC model. The system performs double checking for intrusions using positive and negative intrusion detection policy. Additionally, as one of active responses, the system supports the self-adaptation of security policy depending on various computing environments. Therefore, the system can detect intrusions more accurately and respond to the attacks actively and appropriately. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.",n,
researcher #2,1415,A New Adaptative Security Protocol for UAV Network,"An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is a pilotless aerial vehicle which can be controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or remotely controlled by a pilot at the Ground Control Station (GCS). UAV and Ground Control Station (GCS) define a new form network, this kind of network persuade some specific characteristics as sufficient energy, network connectivity, mobility and network security. These specifications persuade difficult challenges for building a trustworthy and secure communication architecture solution. In this paper we present our new secure communication protocol taking into account the specifications of UAV network. This new architecture depends mostly on the definition of a secure protocol which provides authentication, confidentiality and integrity, in preserving network resources for effective data exchanged between UAV and GCS.",n,
researcher #3,23,A cloud-assisted malware detection and suppression framework for wireless multimedia system in IoT based on dynamic differential game,"As a novel dynamic network service infrastructure, Internet of Things (IoT) has gained remarkable popularity with obvious superiorities in the interoperability and real-time communication. Despite of the convenience in collecting information to provide the decision basis for the users, the vulnerability of embedded sensor nodes in multimedia devices makes the malware propagation a growing serious problem, which would harm the security of devices and their users financially and physically in wireless multimedia system (WMS). Therefore, many researches related to the malware propagation and suppression have been proposed to protect the topology and system security of wireless multimedia network. In these studies, the epidemic model is of great significance to the analysis of malware propagation. Considering the cloud and state transition of sensor nodes, a cloud-assisted model for malware detection and the dynamic differential game against malware propagation are proposed in this paper. Firstly, a SVM based malware detection model is constructed with the data sharing at the security platform in the cloud. Then the number of malware-infected nodes with physical infectivity to susceptible nodes is calculated precisely based on the attributes of WMS transmission. Then the state transition among WMS devices is defined by the modified epidemic model. Furthermore, a dynamic differential game and target cost function are successively derived for the Nash equilibrium between malware and WMS system. On this basis, a saddle-point malware detection and suppression algorithm is presented depending on the modified epidemic model and the computation of optimal strategies. Numerical results and comparisons show that the proposed algorithm can increase the utility of WMS efficiently and effectively.",n,
researcher #3,140,A Blockchain-Based Authentication and Security Mechanism for IoT,"The existing identity authentication of IoT devices mostly depends on an intermediary institution, i.e., a CA server, which suffers from the single-point-failure attack. Even worse, the critical data of authenticated devices can be tampered by inner attacks without being identified. To address these issues, we utilize blockchain technology, which serves as a secure tamper-proof distributed ledger to IoT devices. In the proposed method, we assign a unique ID for each individual device and record them into the blockchain, so that they can authenticate each other without a central authority. We also design a data protection mechanism by hashing significant data (i.e. firmware) into the blockchain where any state changes of the data can be detected immediately. Finally, we implement a prototype based on an open source blockchain platform Hyperledger Fabric to verify the proposed system.",n,Don't see relevance; there is no dynamic security involved here
researcher #3,196,Adaptive security-aware scheduling using multi-agent system,"Internet protocol security (IPsec) provides real-time IP packets with confidentiality security service, making them robust against snooping security threats. Conventionally, the security level provided by such protocol cannot be modified according to the status of the network. In this paper, we propose a security-aware scheduling algorithm for a heterogeneous packet switched network. It provides real-time packet flows with guaranteed quality of service (QoS) while adaptively controls the packet's confidentiality security service level. The proposed scheme is modeled using the object-oriented multi-agent methodology. By applying a buffer estimation technique at the network's end nodes, the algorithm provides a real-time network congestion control hence satisfying the network performance metrics. In order to minimize the overhead of network association performed by the IPsec, the algorithm overloads the priority code point fields of the IEEE 802.1Q tagged frame format. This approach helps meet both QoS and security requirements for real-time data flows.",n,"könnte für mode implementation dienen, wenn aufgrund von gefahren auf sichere(re) komm. gewechselt werden solte"
researcher #3,278,Real-Time Scheduling with Security Enhancement for Packet Switched Networks,"Real-time network applications depend on schedulers to guarantee the quality of service (QoS). Conventional real-time schedulers focus on the timing constraints but are much less effective in satisfying the security requirements. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security-aware scheduling system for packet switched networks using a real-time multi-agent design model. The proposed system combines real-time scheduling with security service enhancement. The scheduling unit uses the differentiated-earliest-deadline-first (Diff-EDF) scheduler and the security enhancement scheme adopts a congestion control mechanism. The required QoS is guaranteed for different types (audio and video) of real-time data flows, while the packet security levels are adaptively enhanced according to the feedbacks from the congestion control module. Compared with the IPsec protocol, the proposed scheme reduces the number of pending packets at the destinations. In implementation, the proposed scheme can overload the priority code point and the virtual-LAN identifier fields of the IEEE 802.1Q frame format, hence eliminating the overhead of the security associations performed by the IPsec protocol.",n,
