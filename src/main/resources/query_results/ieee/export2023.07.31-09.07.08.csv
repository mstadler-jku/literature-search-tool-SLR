"A Secure and Reliable Platform Configuration Change Reporting Mechanism for Trusted Computing Enhanced Secure Channels","K. Dietrich","Microcomputing Laboratory, Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK), Graz, Austria","2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","12 Dec 2008","2008","","","2137","2142","The security of well established secure channel technologies like transport layer security (TLS) or IP security (IPSec) can be significantly improved by emerging concepts like trusted computing. The use of trusted platform modules (TPMs) offers new methods for improving the security of these well established technologies. How secure channel technologies can be adapted to use trusted computing concepts is subject to current research. A major part of this research addresses the integration of the TCG's specified remote attestation. Remote attestation enables a platform to provide a trustworthy proof of its current configuration (i.e. software that has been loaded on the platform). Hence, based on this proof, a remote platform can decide whether to open a channel to another platform or not. In current approaches, the proof of the platform configuration is processed before a secure channel is established, which is not opened if the reported configuration is not accepted by the hosts. However, one important problem has not been solved yet. Currently, no satisfying solution how the change of a platform's configuration can be securely and reliably reported to the remote platform whilst a channel is open, exists. A reliable method to provide a proof for a configuration change can be implemented with only minor modifications of the TPM specification and the TLS protocol. Experimental results show that it is possible to implement this proof mechanism with only a few additional TPM commands.","","978-0-7695-3398-8","10.1109/ICYCS.2008.530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4709304","Trusted computing;platform configuration reporting;secure channels;TLS","Information security;Computer security;Protocols;Proposals;Cryptography;Information processing;Laboratories;Information retrieval;Certification","computer network reliability;cryptographic protocols;IP networks;telecommunication channels;telecommunication security;transport protocols","reliable platform configuration change reporting mechanism;trusted computing;secure channel technology;transport layer security;IP security;trusted platform module;TLS protocol;TPM specification;cryptographic protocol","","1","1","14","IEEE","12 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These threats typically manifest themselves at runtime as new usage scenarios arise and vulnerabilities are discovered. Adaptive security and privacy promise to address these threats by increasing awareness and automating prevention, detection and recovery from security and privacy requirements' failures at runtime by re-configuring system controls and perhaps even changing requirements. This paper discusses the need for adaptive security and privacy in smart grids by presenting some motivating scenarios. We then outline some research issues that arise in engineering adaptive security.

In order to overcome the shortcoming of general RBF net that convergence speed is slow and plunge local extremum easily, a practical learning algorithm was proposed for adjusting the node number, centers and width of Gaussian function of hidden layer nodes effectively.

Contingency Analysis (CA) has been an important tool in power system planning and security analysis for many years. Based on real-time network connectivity, the re-definition function takes into account the actual response of protection subsystem on the power system equipment. It identifies the breakers required for isolating the contingency equipment. This provides additional accuracy of post contingency results and provides important data to ensure the remedial action schemes are emulated correctly. Each contingency is simulated in contingency analysis by opening these breakers to evaluate their impact to the system. The ability to recognize and respect the status of manually operated switches is important to ensure the simulation mimics protection schemes. Any non-contingency equipment forced out as a result of these breaker openings, also called sympathetic outages, will be added to the contingency equipment list. All outage equipment and breakers will be listed on the contingency definition display for each contingency case. This function has been integrated in the real-time CA, off-line CA, and into dispatcher training simulator.","","978-1-61284-788-7","10.1109/PSCE.2011.5772458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5772458","Contingency analysis;contingency re-definition;forced outage;power system protection;remedial action scheme;sympathetic outage;state estimator;topology","Real time systems;Power system dynamics;Circuit faults;Circuit breakers;Power system security;Training","power system planning;power system protection;power system security","contingency redefinition;power system security analysis;power system planning;network connectivity;protection subsystem;power system equipment;remedial action schemes;manually operated switches;protection schemes;breaker openings;sympathetic outages;real-time CA;off-line CA;dispatcher training simulator","","8","","8","IEEE","23 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is now normal for performance and availability of such systems to be carefully measured and evaluated. Contracts that include financial penalties in case of breach are now common. However security is lagging behind this trend; it is as important to stakeholders as performance and availability, but is generally not included in the scope of service-level agreements between stakeholders, and handled instead on a best-effort basis, without any transparency nor SLA with their clients. One reason for this is the difficulty of objectively measuring security. Indeed, the actual security level of a system is dependent on a wide range of factors, some intrinsic to the system - such as a design or implementation mistake resulting in a vulnerability - and some extrinsic to it. For instance, an external event such as the publication of a vulnerability in an open-source software dependency or a change of political context in a country can widely impact the risks faced by an information system even if no actual change were made to the system. These factors are even more numerous in multi-tenant cloud infrastructures because of the sheer number of actors involved - and their sometimes conflicting incentives - and opportunities for both attack and defense at scale. Security monitoring aims to detect and react to attacks in real time; Reactive security monitoring intends to take external events into account while doing so. Improving the accuracy of a system's overall security assessment can help transitioning security to a SLA paradigm and enable better transparency for all stakeholders.","","978-1-5386-5175-9","10.1109/FAS-W.2018.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599521","Security;Cloud;SLA;IDS","Security;Software;Cloud computing;Information systems;Prototypes;Monitoring;Contracts","cloud computing;contracts;public domain software;security of data","multitenant cloud;external event;security assessment;transparency;adaptive security monitoring;cloud computing;service-level agreements;information systems stakeholders;financial penalties;best-effort basis;actual security level;open-source software dependency;information system;actual change;reactive security monitoring","","2","","17","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In real time environment, data-base may be created by keeping the record of operating states by state estimation. The severity of contingency for each case with respect to different contingencies (single line outages) is assessed by number of secure and insecure operating states, which is predicted by CBR. Security classes are defined by threshold value of maximum loadability margins, calculated using the continuation power flow analysis.

On the other hand, trust management systems are designed to deal with selfish behaviors or internal attacks and not to assist cryptographic measures. Our solution evaluates the trust level related to the presence of security threats among nodes, and adapt consequently cryptographic measures.

""Having Divided to Conquer We Must Reunite [to] Rule"". Decomposition of problems and systems into smaller, more manageable units has been at the heart of software engineering practice for decades. ""Separation of concerns"" gives software engineers the conceptual and practical tools to focus their attention, and their tools, on the parts of the problem or solution to which they are best suited. Perhaps one of the earliest boundaries used to separate concerns is that which exists between hardware and software - once that boundary is drawn, software engineers were able to focus their attention on the development of software within the hardware boundaries chosen. There has however, been a steady erosion of such boundaries: digital and physical connectivity have become the norm, and increasingly such connectivity can be ad hoc, spontaneous, and often unplanned (perhaps best exemplified by the Internet of Things paradigm). Moreover, the fluid and disappearing boundaries between technology and people have radically affected social behaviours (again, perhaps well exemplified by the proliferation of mobile and ubiquitous computing such as wearable and 'smart' technologies used in variety of personal and community settings). Such convergence between digital, physical, and social spaces has provided exciting opportunities for software engineers to, literally, 'cross boundaries', and, as a result, to have an impact on the physical and social worlds in which the software they build will operate. But in this brave new world with porous boundaries, security engineering and privacy management challenges abound. Effective security depends on the ability to control access to assets protected by boundaries. Effective privacy management depends on informed, consensual sharing of information across boundaries. Our thesis is that, although increasingly invisible, and rightly so, explicit awareness and sometimes representation of boundaries in cyber-physical-social systems facilitate good old fashioned separation of concerns, which in turn enables more effective software engineering of secure, privacy-aware software. We support our thesis with examples from our research in adaptive security and privacy.","","978-1-5386-4043-2","10.1109/SEsCPS.2017.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968016","adaptive security and privacy;cyber-physical-social systems","Software;Security;Privacy;Software engineering;Tools;Conferences;Cyber-physical systems","software engineering","crossing boundaries;digital spaces;physical spaces;social spaces;software engineering practice;software engineers;physical connectivity;Internet of Things;mobile computing;ubiquitous computing;wearable;smart technologies;porous boundaries;security engineering;privacy management;cyber-physical-social systems;privacy-aware software;adaptive security","","","","","IEEE","7 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we describe an approach detailing key steps and activities to create an adaptive security solution. The architecture conforms to the MAPE-K reference model, which is a widely applied reference model in autonomic computing. Steps include: Establishing a control point to force control of the security decision process from the existing system. Identifying an environment parameter with which the security will trade off. Studying the interrelationship between security and the environment parameter in the existing system context by identifying measurable factors which influence their relationship.

In order to further reduce the power consumption during network communication, the delay between sending two successive packets is analyzed. The proposed architecture is capable of stalling packets and sending them in burst-mode, letting the network interface to stay in low-power mode for a longer period of time. The power consumption in this mode is reduced for additional 25%.","","978-1-4673-7516-0","10.1109/TELSKS.2015.7357791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357791","Mobile applications;security protocols;battery life;power consumption","Ciphers","3G mobile communication;access protocols;Android (operating system);cryptography;power consumption;software architecture;telecommunication power management;wireless LAN","stalling packets;successive packets;3G network;WiFi;Android platform;cipher suites;security protocols;security levels;mobile devices;network protocols;adaptive security;M-health applications;software architecture;power consumption aware","","","","12","IEEE","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system security constraints are in fact boundaries that surround all possible operating modes (scenarios) of the power system. In other words, these boundaries form the feasible operating domain - in the parameter space spanned by various operating variables - within which the system can safely be operated. For a given operating scenario, the associated security level is measured by the “distance” (for example, the Euclidean norm) of the operating point from the security region boundary. This paper reports on the results of a recently completed research and development paper, which included the development of innovative computerized schemes, which are capable of identifying dynamic operating security modes during the on-line operation of electric power systems. The methodology adopted in this paper includes the development of advanced, highly efficient computerized algorithms for fast identification of dynamic operating security modes of power systems. One of the salient outcomes of this paper is the development of a novel framework for identification and representation of operating security regions in power systems as well as evaluation of security levels associated with different operating scenarios. While the concepts and principles presented are general, the work of this paper is confined to the interpretation of the security boundary in terms of system stability criteria.

It provides real-time packet flows with guaranteed quality of service (QoS) while adaptively controls the packet's confidentiality security service level. The proposed scheme is modeled using the object-oriented multi-agent methodology. By applying a buffer estimation technique at the network's end nodes, the algorithm provides a real-time network congestion control hence satisfying the network performance metrics. In order to minimize the overhead of network association performed by the IPsec, the algorithm overloads the priority code point fields of the IEEE 802.1Q tagged frame format.

Engineering adaptive security is not an easy task. A set of effective security countermeasures should be identified. These countermeasures should not only be applied to (primary) assets that customers desire to protect, but also to other (secondary) assets that can be exploited by attackers to harm the primary assets. Another challenge arises when assets vary dynamically at runtime. To accommodate these variabilities, it is necessary to monitor changes in assets, and apply the most appropriate countermeasures at runtime. The paper provides three main contributions for engineering adaptive security. First, it proposes a modeling notation to represent primary and secondary assets, along with their variability. Second, it describes how to use the extended models in engineering security requirements and designing required monitoring functions. Third, the paper illustrates our approach through a set of adaptive security scenarios in the customer domain of a smart grid.

A typical ICS includes an extensive range of comput-erized devices, control systems, and networking appliances used to manage efficiently an industrial process across large geographical areas. ICS underpin sensitive and critical national infrastructures such as water treatment and energy production and transportation. The consequences of a successful attack against them can lead to shutting the infrastructure down which has major impacts such as production stoppages or safety implications for people, the environment, and assets. At the same time, running a process while the infrastructure is under attack or compromised also has safety im-plications, potentially catastrophic. This work-in-progress focuses on an adaptive approach, able to alter the defensive posture while providing assurances about operational capacity (or downgrading it) and safety. Our approach involves transforming policies from simply a means to enforce security requirements defined a priori, to adaptive objects that are capable to evolve in response to unfolding attacks.

CA studies the impact of equipment outage on the system. This paper presents the dynamic contingency redefinition in power system security analysis. Contingency definition is usually accomplished in an off-line development environment. The pre-defined contingency cases are studied in the off-line or on-line contingency analysis program. Usually the contingency definition defines hypothetical equipment outage or fault. It does not explicitly specify the isolating breakers of the fault. The dynamic contingency re-definition takes into account the actual response of protection subsystem to the equipment outage. It identifies the breakers required for isolating the contingency equipment. This provides additional accuracy of post contingency results to ensure the analysis accuracy and the remedial action schemes emulated correctly. Each re-defined contingency is simulated in CA by opening these breakers to evaluate their impact on the system. The ability to respect the status of manually operated switches is important to ensure the simulation mimics protection schemes. Any non-contingency equipment forced out as a result of these breaker openings will be added to the contingency equipment list. All outage equipment and breakers will be listed on the contingency definition display for each contingency case.

The close dependency of major transmission paths requires an approach that takes that interaction into account while establishing operational transfer capability, and evaluates grid reliability and security on a system-wide basis. Thus, the concept of wide-area security region, which considers all essential constraints, including thermal, voltage stability, transient stability, and small signal stability, is proposed. This approach expands the idea of traditional transmission system nomograms to a multidimensional case, involving multiple system limits and parameters such as transmission path constraints, zonal generation or load, etc., considered concurrently. In this paper, the security region boundary is represented using piecewise approximation with the help of linear inequalities (so called hyperplanes) in a multidimensional space, consisting of system parameters that are critical for security analysis. The goal of this approximation is to find a minimum set of hyperplanes that describe the boundary with a given accuracy. Offline computer simulations are conducted to build the security region and the hyperplanes can be applied in real time with phasor information for on-line security assessment. Numerical simulations have been performed for the full size Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system model, which comprises 15 126 buses and 3034 generators. Simulation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach, and proved that the proposed approach can significantly enhance the wide-area situation awareness for a bulk power system like WECC.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2012.2193145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6213174","Operating transfer capability;real time security assessment;security margin;wide-area dynamic security region","Security;Strontium;Stress;Thermal stability;Power system stability;Phasor measurement units;Monitoring","approximation theory;linear matrix inequalities;phasor measurement;power grids;power system security;power transmission reliability","PMU-based wide-area security assessment;phasor measurement unit information;power system wide-area security monitoring;operational transfer capability;grid reliability;grid security;system-wide basis;wide-area security region;voltage stability;transient stability;thermal stability;small signal stability;transmission system nomograms;transmission path constraints;zonal generation;piecewise approximation;linear inequalities;multidimensional space;hyperplanes;computer simulations;on-line security assessment;numerical simulations;Western Electricity Coordinating Council system model;WECC system model;wide-area situation awareness;bulk power system","","70","","26","IEEE","6 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To ascertain this, analysis and calculation plays an important role. Power system calculations can be classified into three categories in time domain: for the past, for the present and for the future respectively. And the calculations for the future seem to be more significant to support power system operation and make production arrangement. However, almost all the calculations of power system are based on the mathematic models established from the physical system; and the models may have various errors and mismatch the actual system, especially for the calculations facing the future. The mismatch between calculation model and actual system influences the analysis result and the operation of power system. Aimed at the possible mismatch between calculation model and actual power system, this paper analyzes the influences of bus operating mode, transmission line operating mode, load distribution and quantity respectively on power system transient stability. The results show that the mismatch of grid structure can influence power system stability more greatly than loads do. As the mismatch between calculation model and actual system always exists, this paper also suggests that power system analysis should depend more on measurements rather than calculation model.","1947-1270","981-05-5702-7","10.1109/IPEC.2005.207076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1627365","T error analysis;model mismatch;power system;transient stability analysis;WAMS","Power system modeling;Power system stability;Power system analysis computing;Power system reliability;Power system transients;Mathematical model;Production systems;Mathematics;Power transmission lines;Stability analysis","power system transient stability;power system security;load distribution;power transmission reliability;time-domain analysis","model mismatch;power system calculation;power system reliability;power system security;time domain;production arrangement;power system calculations;bus operating mode;transmission line operating mode;load distribution;power system transient stability","","","","29","","8 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The higher level of uncertainty that stems from this variability makes it more difficult to determine whether a given operating condition will be secure or insecure. Data-driven techniques provide a promising way to identify security rules that can be embedded in economic dispatch model to keep power system operating states secure. This paper proposes using a sparse weighted oblique decision tree to learn accurate, understandable, and embeddable security rules that are linear and can be extracted as sparse matrices using a recursive algorithm. These matrix rules can then be easily embedded as security constraints in power system economic dispatch calculations using the Big-M method.

Identifying and evaluating assets are therefore key activities in any security engineering process - from modeling threats and attacks, discovering existing vulnerabilities, to selecting appropriate countermeasures. However, despite their crucial role, assets are often neglected during the development of secure software systems. Indeed, many systems are designed with fixed security boundaries and assumptions, without the possibility to adapt when assets change unexpectedly, new threats arise, or undiscovered vulnerabilities are revealed. To handle such changes, systems must be capable of dynamically enabling different security countermeasures. This paper promotes assets as first-class entities in engineering secure software systems. An asset model is related to requirements, expressed through a goal model, and the objectives of an attacker, expressed through a threat model. These models are then used as input to build a causal network to analyze system security in different situations, and to enable, when necessary, a set of countermeasures to mitigate security threats. The causal network is conceived as a runtime entity that tracks relevant changes that may arise at runtime, and enables a new set of countermeasures. We illustrate and evaluate our proposed approach by applying it to a substantive example concerned with security of mobile phones.","2332-6441","978-1-4673-2785-5","10.1109/RE.2012.6345794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345794","Security requirements;Adaptation;Causal reasoning","Security;Adaptation models;Runtime;Mobile handsets;Credit cards;Analytical models;Usability","security of data;software engineering;systems analysis","requirements-driven adaptive security;security engineering process;secure software systems;undiscovered vulnerabilities;security countermeasures;secure software engineering systems;variable asset protection","","43","","25","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the second stage, a multi-mode data-driven local control strategy is designed in real-time Volt/Var control (VVC) with three operation modes, which are energy saving mode, reactive power reservation mode and security operation mode respectively. The coordination and transition among different control modes allow system operators to achieve both energy savings and voltage security under various conditions. The flexible reactive power margin of PVs can also be adaptively improved through cooperation with CBs. Moreover, a data-driven deep convolution neural network (CNN) is developed and trained as a local controller (LC) to regulate the reactive power of PVs based on local measurements.

Present-day power systems are dynamic in nature, where the network topology frequently changes with load demand. With increase in load, the power system network is loaded to its limits, making it susceptible to collapse even under minor disturbances. In order to operate the power system economically, the current operating state of the system must be identified as either secure or insecure. An artificial neural network (ANN) aided method for security assessment is proposed and illustrated for a model six-bus power system. The work demonstrates the feasibility of classification of load patterns for power system static security assessment using a Kohonen self-organizing feature map. The most important aspect of this network is its generalization property. Using 15 different line-loading patterns for training, the network successfully classifies the unknown loading patterns. This powerful and versatile feature is especially useful for power system operation.

In the prior-art grid resilience studies, the hurricanes or wildfires are mainly defended in terms of expected line damages, while they are prone to trigger short-circuit fault (SCF) evolved with dynamic influence in reality. In this paper, a fragile model is developed to evaluate the nodal SCF probability considering the insulation aging of equipment and extreme weather condition. Then, a response framework for extreme weather events is developed for a transmission system to defend the cascading impacts of expected SCFs. Specifically, switches are shifted to restrain the out-of-range short-circuit currents (SCCs) so that to ensure the SCFs can be removed by circuit breakers, generation rescheduling and load shedding are arranged to maintain the post-fault system transient stability. The above measures are optimized simultaneously by an integrated Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP). Considering the error or uncertainty of weather event forecasts, a multi-state model is established to provide the most cost-effective grid resilience enhancement scheme, in which the expected urgent adaptions of the initial scheme subject to weather state transition is included in the overall cost. The proposed model and techniques are validated using the IEEE 39-bus New-England test system and realistic meteorological data.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2020.3043938","China NSFC(grant numbers:51807173); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290096","Resilience;extreme weather;short-circuit fault;short-circuit current;transient stability;multi-state","Meteorology;Power system stability;Aging;Hurricanes;Circuit faults;Transient analysis;Resilience;Climate change","circuit breakers;integer programming;load shedding;nonlinear programming;power grids;power system reliability;power system security;power system transient stability;probability;short-circuit currents","multistate model;transmission system resilience enhancement;short-circuit fault;extreme weather events;global climate change;power systems;prior-art grid resilience studies;expected line damages;fragile model;nodal SCF probability;extreme weather condition;expected SCFs;out-of-range short-circuit currents;circuit breakers;post-fault system transient stability;weather event forecasts;cost-effective grid resilience enhancement scheme;expected urgent adaptions;IEEE 39-bus New-England test system","","80","","34","IEEE","10 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional protection systems are non-adaptive and have been usually applied with bias towards dependability, one of the two considerations on designing electric grid protection systems (the other one is security). The art and science of protection and control of tomorrow drives the power system professionals to design and implement schemes that are adaptive and aim towards security. It is important to minimize system exposures when the power system is in a stressed state or in early stages of a sequence of events to halt or mitigate disturbance propagation. One of the leading contributions to the future of grid protection would be to avoid incorrect tripping of unaffected equipment therefore maintaining the power system integrity. In addition, with the ever-increasing load demand and the advent of the deregulated power market recently, power systems are pushed more often to operate close to design limits and with more uncertainty of the system operating mode. The proposed protection systems offer adaptive concepts by adjusting the need for more dependability or security as applicable, through the application of fuzzy logic and based on a set of real-time factors, such as system state index, nodal price, and equipment outage impact index. Results from our work can be used as a roadmap for further enhancement leading to the introduction of algorithms in commercial products.","2160-8563","978-1-4244-1903-6","10.1109/TDC.2008.4517163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4517163","Dependability;security;fuzzy logic;protection systems;adaptive","Power system protection;Power system security;Power systems;Art;Control systems;Power system control;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Power markets;Uncertainty","fuzzy logic;power markets;power system protection;power system security","electric power system protection;power system security;load demand;power market deregulation;fuzzy logic","","1","","17","IEEE","12 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the planning stage, the defender can utilize software diversity, which is a common phenomenon that the cyber software of different substations comes from different competing vendors. Therefore, different kinds of software may not be exposed to the same zero-day security loophole, preventing the attacker from taking charge of multiple substations at the same time. In this paper, the optimal scheme of software deployment considering long-term risk mitigation is studied. Firstly, the framework of diversity-based cyber defense against malicious attacks is formulated. Secondly, the risk index based on representative attack patterns is constructed, which is the objective to be minimized. Thirdly, considering that the deployment scheme is long-term stable while the operating mode varies with time, we construct a multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming to mitigate the average risk of operating modes. Then the optimization problem is solved by the multiobjective genetic algorithm. Lastly, results of the IEEE 39-node CPPS and and the Virtual European Grid demonstrate that the proposed method can considerably reduce the attack risk.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2021.3086681","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2017YFB0903000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1766203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447199","Cyber-physical power system;multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA);nonlinear integer programming;risk mitigation;stochastic programming;software diversity","Substations;Cyberattack;Software;Power systems;Indexes;Security;Risk management","computer crime;cyber-physical systems;genetic algorithms;nonlinear programming;power engineering computing;power generation protection;power grids;power system security;risk management;software engineering;stochastic programming;substations","diversity-based cyber defense;malicious attacks;risk index;representative attack patterns;attack risk;software deployment;long-term risk mitigation;cyber-physical power systems;wide-area cyber attacks;software diversity;cyber software;zero-day security loophole;substations;multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming;optimization;multiobjective genetic algorithm;IEEE 39-node CPPS;virtual European grid","","1","","38","IEEE","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ultimate goal of an IDPS system is to stop security attacks before they have been carried successfully. This paper proposed an efficient network-based IDPS System which takes multiple counteractions against network attacks. The proposed system's first reaction after detecting malicious packets is to generate an alert and log them; if the number of packets goes beyond threshold limit in one second, the second counteraction takes place to block the attackers IP address through firewall. Finally, if the system fails to block these packets, the third counteraction takes place to remotely stop the corresponding service.

Users collect the image data where people need attention together with the location data from GPS and its comments by UMPC (Ultra-Mobile PC) or mobile phone outside. Currently, UMPC is used for the system development to temporarily overcome the limitations of application development on the mobile-phone, although data collection using mobile-phone must be a successful solution. Collected data are sent to a server machine, and the server machine automatically creates the information map that collected images and comments are arranged based on location data sent together. The created map is also published on the Net. This implementation is based on Ajax, using Google Maps API and JavaScript. The data collection can be done by several users and stored at a server space for each projects. When several users collect the information around the same area, the data collection eventually becomes a collaborative work.

Role-based access control (RBAC), which is likely the most popular access-control technique, specifies “user roles” and associates each role with “permissions” to access distinct system functionalities. These role-permissions assignment rules, as well as the types of system users and system functionalities, evolve over time. In this paper, we describe a methodology for analyzing and understanding the RBAC-configuration evolution, its relation to the overall evolutionary lifecycle of industrial systems, and its impact on security vulnerabilities from which the system may suffer. Our methodology considers two different sources of information regarding the RBAC-configuration evolution: 1) the role-permissions matrices of subsequent system versions; and 2) the corresponding concept lattices, implied by these matrices. By examining the evolution of these two system properties, developers can easily notice which versions involve more and more complex RBAC-configuration changes that may indicate higher security risks. We demonstrate our methodology using a study of four popular real-world systems: 1) MediaWiki; 2) Moodle; 3) Joomla; and 4) WordPress.

Analysis of the current operating state and prediction of plausible future insecurity is crucial for real-time decision-making and implementation of necessary control strategies to ensure secure operation of bulk power systems. On-line security assessment demands low complexity and computational time. The traditional methods of assessment of dynamic security of electric power systems often prove to be inadequate for online and real-time conditions due to their high complexity and long computation time. This article proposes a pattern recognition approach to dynamic security analysis for large and complex power systems using ensemble decision tree to form reliable decision rules for fast and accurate prediction of power system's operating states in a real-time and on-line environment. An ensemble security predictor (ENSP) was developed and trained to act as “dynamic security state predictor” to predict and classify power system's dynamic operating states into secure, insecure, and intermediate transitional classes. Two different case studies were performed on IEEE 118-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed method on systems of varying size and complexity. While prediction accuracy of some of the single-learner classifiers decreased considerably when implemented on a large sized system, the performance of ENSP declined marginally, and the results were acceptable for very large sized systems.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2020.2978504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9044298","Classification;dynamic security;ensemble decision tree;feature extraction;feature selection;pattern recognition;power system transient stability;prediction","Security;Power system stability;Power system dynamics;Decision trees;Real-time systems;Feature extraction;Training","decision making;decision trees;IEEE standards;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;power engineering computing;power system security","ensemble security predictor;IEEE 300-bus systems;ensemble decision tree-based power system dynamic security state predictor;real-time decision-making;computational time;electric power system control;complex power systems;on-line security assessment;IEEE 118-bus system","","16","","25","IEEE","23 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, potential merits of hardware-based solutions to further secure application exposure have not been considered so far. This paper describes a method for combining software resource level security features offered by Web services technologies, with the hardware-based security mechanisms offered by trusted computing platform and system virtualisation approaches. In particular, we propose trust-based architecture for protecting the enforcement middleware deployed at the policy enforcement endpoints of Web and grid services.

Graphical security models (e.g., Attack Graphs and Attack Trees) and security metrics (e.g., attack cost, shortest attack path) are widely used to systematically analyse the security posture of network systems. However, there are problems using them to assess the security of dynamic networks. First, the existing graphical security models are unable to capture dynamic changes occurring in the networks over time. Second, the existing security metrics are not designed for dynamic networks such that their effectiveness to the dynamic changes in the network is still unknown. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis via simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of security metrics using a Temporal Hierarchical Attack Representation Model. Further, we investigate the varying effects of security metrics when changes are observed in the dynamic networks.

This problem is exacerbated for those operational technology (OT) networks supporting industrial control systems (ICS) since much of that equipment was originally designed to be on a network that was isolated and generally considered free of malefactors. Increasing pressure to bridge these systems with traditional information technology (IT) networks has introduced a bevy of new threats. In response, both academia and industry have responded with security solutions tailored to ICS environments. Deploying these protection systems often involves several configuration choices. While some of these choices are clear (e.g., block/enable protocol X) others are far more subjective (e.g. alert threshold == 3.43). Further complicating the situation, while often similar to IT networks, OT networks have unique challenges and characteristics that make the task of protecting them simultaneously more difficult and straight forward. Extant solutions for quantifying the relative security of intrusion detection systems fail to effectively support the operators of said systems with understanding the impact of various configuration changes. Further, they assume that the attacks are static and not subject to manipulation or alteration in the face of defenses. In this paper, we present a threat-based method for quantifying the relative impact of various security settings for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) within ICS environments. This method provides operational staff with a clear understanding of the relative impact of their settings and assumes that the attacks levied against them are dynamic. The model is described in detail, we apply the model to a synthetic data set, and discuss the inferences that can be made and what types of decisions they could be used to support.","","978-1-7281-6389-5","10.1109/ICPS48405.2020.9274691","Battelle; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274691","industrial control systems;intrusion detection systems;assessment;risk quantification","Security;Integrated circuits;Intrusion detection;Software;Government;Task analysis;Risk management","computer network security;industrial control;local area networks;production engineering computing","security-relevant settings;anomaly-based intrusion detection;industrial control systems;OT networks;intrusion detection systems;Ethernet-based network;operational technology networks;configuration changes;IDS;ICS","","1","","19","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Supported by big data and cloud computing, bulk power grid security defense system was divided into two parts: one is the prevention and control of operation risks. Power grid risks are eliminated and influence of random faults is reduced through measures such as network planning, power-cut scheme, risk pre-warning, equipment status monitoring, voltage control, frequency control and adjustment of operating mode. The other is the fault recovery control. By updating “three defense lines”, intelligent relay protection is used to deal with the challenges brought by EHV AC/DC hybrid grid and new energy resources.

In this paper we present an adaptive and evolving security (AES), and an adaptive trust management (ATM) approach to such autonomic messaging middleware systems, an approach that learns, anticipates, evolves and adapts to a changing environment at run-time in the face of changing threats.

Therefore, new strategies need to be devised for cost-effective security provision. In this paper, we motivate the integration of a context-aware security controller into LTE/EPS networks to minimize the overall security cost. This controller activates security mechanisms according to the contextual information such as the application type and the device capabilities.

Moreover, security risk is evaluated subjectively based on Prospect Theory to reflect realistic scenarios where the attacker and the edge system do not similarly perceive the status of the infrastructure.

For this purpose, a new category of contingencies called abnormal contingencies and a new system operating state called verge-of-collapse are proposed. The application of these abnormal contingencies to the vulnerable areas can lead to a system on the verge-of-collapse. In particular, there are two conditions that generally occur for a system to be on the verge-of-collapse: firstly, the system is in a degraded state or close to its operation limits and secondly it must be subjected to abnormal contingencies in the areas of vulnerability. The result of this study is to define areas of vulnerability in a network which can then be identified and appropriate remedial action initiated when required. Different stages are required for the protection of systems on the verge of collapse, namely: a) how to define areas of vulnerability, b) how to identify these areas of vulnerability and c) how to protect the system in the presence of areas of vulnerability.

In this work, we studied the security of the proposed OAM wiretap system by applying physical layer security theory to OAM communications. Firstly, we proposed a uniform circular array-based multi-mode OAM system and derived the secrecy capacity. Secondly, the phase profiles, channel capacity and received power of OAM beams are analyzed in terms of various system parameters in oblique scenarios at 30GHz. Thirdly, we discussed the security of the proposed OAM wiretap system. The results show that the system using vortex waves is superior to conventional communication systems using planar electromagnetic waves in terms of system security due to the inherent divergence and spiral phase structure of OAM beams. Moreover, we found that the distortion of OAM beams during transmission and the center shift at receiving end will occur and that system is more stable for high-mode OAM propagation in oblique scenarios.

The scheme has self- and context-awareness in addition to a holistic view of security services at each layer of the communication stack. It uses distributed agents and intrusion detection systems to monitor the security threats and then dynamically adapts its security level by jointly considering several dimensions.

This is because the requirements for the respective computer usage are different in network and security policies. In this paper, the destination addressing control system scheme (DACS scheme) for the university network services is shown. The DACS scheme performs network management efficiently through the communication control of a client. As the characteristic of DACS scheme, only the setup modification is required by a system administrator, when configuration change of the network system is done. Then, the setup modification by a customer is unnecessary, which shows a merit for both the system administrator and the customer. But, there are some security problems to be solved. In this paper, secure DACS scheme is proposed and examined. Secure DACS scheme has functions to prevent the communication from the client which DACS client is not installed in and to prevent information interception.","","978-1-5090-8837-9","10.1109/ICNS.2007.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438261","","Network servers;Cryptography;Computer network management;Communication system control;Tunneling;Computer networks;Control systems;Computer security;Communication system security;Information security","client-server systems;computer network management;local area networks;telecommunication control;telecommunication security","DACS scheme;university network system management;network policies;security policies;destination addressing control system scheme;setup modification;system administration","","3","","17","IEEE","22 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, terrorism actions could be considered as the largest threat to the power infrastructure in some countries. The robustness and security of a power system has to be related to the ability of the system to support contingencies due to terrorism actions. Therefore, methods and techniques should be developed with the main aim of improving power system security against terrorism. To collaborate to this effort this paper proposes an extension of a well known classification of events and operating states. A classification that includes internal and external natural and unnatural or man caused events is important for proposing new security analysis methods that consider event uncertainties. Natural events are mainly random while unnatural event uncertainty are ambiguous, vague or confuse and some kind of expert elicitation should be applied. In Colombia during year 2002 about 500 towers were destroyed by terrorists.

We remedy this situation by proposing an adaptive quality of security control scheme for networked parallel disk systems (or ASPAD for short) that makes it possible for networked disk systems to adapt to changing security requirements and workload conditions. ASPAD is carried out in three phases: dynamic data partitioning, response time estimation, and adaptive security quality control. Hence, ASPAD is conducive to adaptively and expeditiously determining security schemes for disk requests in a way to improve security of networked parallel disk systems while making an effort to guarantee desired response times of the requests. To prove the efficiency of the proposed approach, we simulate a networked parallel disk system into which nine cryptographic schemes are integrated.

In the context of self-adaptive systems, adaptive security concerns with adjusting protection mechanisms at runtime while changes occur in the operating environment. One of the challenges with self-adaptation paradigm is that the reasoning engine must leverage existing requirements and constraints and at the same time deal with different types of imperfections due to absence of knowledge or data. The problem arises when the existing runtime requirements models offer no explicit support for imperfections. By imperfections, we mean the values of some attributes of interest are not available at certain points. To address this problem, we propose uncertain reasoning based on imperfect requirements using non-monotonic logic. We model security requirements, system executions and changes in operation environment through non-monotonic logic that explicitly represents imperfect information and accounts for uncertainty.","0730-3157","978-1-4673-8845-0","10.1109/COMPSAC.2016.46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552057","Self-Adaptive Systems;Security Requirements;Formal Methods;Logic Programming","Security;Runtime;Adaptation models;Cognition;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Context","formal logic;inference mechanisms;security of data","adaptive reasoning;imperfect security requirements;self-adaptive systems;adaptive security;self-adaptation paradigm;reasoning engine;runtime requirements;nonmonotonic logic;security requirements","","3","","8","IEEE","25 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many network planning and operation procedures set forth by Independent System Operators and followed by many utilities consider the computation of the VSSM for a predefined load increase direction. Usually, this direction corresponds to increasing all loads with constant power factor and the MW generated at generation buses by using one loading factor only. However, situations may occur where small variations in this direction, as for example, an unexpected load increase at any bus or set of buses, may result in smaller VSSM, thus leading the system to an insecure operating state. The goal of this paper is to propose a combination of a fast method to estimate the VSSM with an efficient method to calculate the appropriate direction of load increase for which the margin is minimum. This information, along with the usual VSSM, can provide system operators with relevant information regarding the system's security. More complete information allow operators to take decisions like preventive control actions to move the system to a securer operating point. The procedure is divided into two main stages. The first one consists of estimating the maximum loading point (MLP) and consequently the VSSM, by using nonlinear programming techniques. The second stage consists of computing new directions of load increase. These new directions are based on eigenvector handling. Also, the use of a special load flow method with step size optimization results into a more efficient computation process. Simulation results for IEEE standard and realistic power systems are shown to evaluate the method.","","1-4244-0110-0","10.1109/ICPST.2006.321785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4116416","Power system security;voltage stability;maximum loading point (MLP);nonlinear programming;eigenanalysis","Power system stability;Power system security;Voltage;Power system planning;Power generation;Power system simulation;Computer networks;Reactive power;Information security;Control systems","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;IEEE standards;load flow;nonlinear programming;power system security;power system stability","voltage stability security margins;electrical power systems;maximum loading point;nonlinear programming techniques;eigenvector handling;load flow method;step size optimization;IEEE standard","","2","","15","IEEE","26 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A risk index designated as CSOSR (composite system operating state risk) has been defined and the utilization of this CSOSR for a simple system expansion plan has been demonstrated.

Therefore simulate the cascading process of power system is more meaningful than a single device contingency analysis. Against such backgrounds, this paper proposes a method for cascading failure simulation with static security analysis method, which considers the load variation during the fault. The method is divided into two steps: firstly, a self-adapting step is figured out with the climbing rate of the daily load curve, and secondly, the power flow at the self-adapting step, which is used to judge if another fault or even the cascading event has happened is calculated. In this way, the process of cascading failure can be simulated and monitored, which is beneficial for the operators to obtain the operating state of the power system in time and adopt appropriate measures to prevent the system from deteriorating into a large-scale blackout accidents.

The security assessment of power system is being considered as an important problem in planning, operation and control. Security assessment entails that the system should remain in secure operating state under abnormal conditions. In a power system the Security assessment is carried out by using the voltage performance index (VPI) following a contingency. Contingencies are termed as the uncertain events, occurred due to line outage in the system. VPI can be used for identifying the critical contingency from the perspective of bus voltage violation limits. Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices are having a great impact on the performance of the transmission network. FACTS devices are used for controlling real and reactive power flows and regulating the bus voltages in power systems. Also, FACTS devices raises power transfer capability reduces system losses and improves system stability, because of their fast and flexible control characteristics. Owing to their huge capital cost, it is essential to place these devices optimally in a power system. In this paper, Differential Evolution (DE), a population based stochastic meta-heuristic optimization algorithm is applied for optimal placement of static var compensator (SVC) aimed to the voltage security enhancement of a power system. The SVC placement is considered to be a planning problem and is formulated as a multi-criteria problem comprising of minimization of real power loss, voltage security and investment cost of SVC under single line outage contingencies. Effectiveness of the DE algorithm based approach has been demonstrated on IEEE 30-bus test system.","","978-1-4799-4040-0","10.1109/ICRAIE.2014.6909310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909310","Power system Security;FACTS;SVC;Single line Outage Contingency;Real Power Loss;VPI;Cost of SVC;DE Algorithm","Static VAr compensators;Sociology;Statistics;Reactive power;Indexes","electricity supply industry;flexible AC transmission systems;load flow control;losses;optimisation;performance index;power system security;power system stability;power transmission control;power transmission planning;static VAr compensators;stochastic programming;voltage control","optimal placement;optimal sizing;SVC;voltage security improvement;differential evolution algorithm;restructuring power systems;electric utilities;power system security assessment;power system planning;power system operation;power system control;secure operating state;abnormal conditions;voltage performance index;VPI;line outage;critical contingency identification;bus voltage violation limits;flexible alternating current transmission systems devices;FACTS devices;transmission network;real power flow control;reactive power flow control;bus voltage regulation;power transfer capability;system loss reduction;system stability improvement;capital cost;DE;population based stochastic meta-heuristic optimization algorithm;static var compensator;multicriteria problem;IEEE 30-bus test system;loss minimization","","13","","28","IEEE","25 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we analyze the security guarantees that used to defend against physical attacks, and make the observation that heterogeneous GPU memory system may not always need all the security mechanisms to achieve the security guarantees. Based on the memory types as well as memory access patterns either explicitly specified in the GPU programming model or implicitly detected at run time, we propose adaptive security memory support for heterogeneous memory on GPUs. Specifically, we first identify the read-only data and propose to only use MAC (Message Authentication Code) to protect their integrity. By eliminating the freshness checks on read-only data, we can use an on-chip shared counter for such data regions and remove the corresponding parts in the Bonsai Merkel Tree (BMT), thereby reducing the traffic due to encryption counters and the BMT. Second, we detect the common streaming data access pattern and propose coarse- grain MACs for such stream data to reduce the MAC access bandwidth. With the hardware-based detection of memory type (read-only or not) and memory access patterns (streaming or not), our proposed approach adapts the security support to significantly reduce the performance overhead without sacrificing the security guarantees. Our evaluation shows that our scheme can achieve secure memory on GPUs with low overheads for memory-intensive workloads. Among the fifteen memory-intensive workloads in our evaluation, our design reduces the performance overheads of secure GPU memory from 53.9% to 8.09% on average. Compared to the state-of- the-art secure memory designs for GPU [17], [33], our scheme outperforms PSSM by up to 41.63% and 9.5% on average and outperforms Common counters by 84.04% on average for memory-intensive workloads. We further propose to use the L2 cache as a victim cache for security metadata when the L2 is either underutilized or suffers from very high miss rates, which further reduces the overheads by up to 4% and 0.65% on average.","2378-203X","978-1-6654-2027-3","10.1109/HPCA53966.2022.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773192","GPUs;secure memory;heterogeneous memory;encryption;integrity check;security metadata cache","Graphics processing units;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Metadata;Programming;Hardware;System-on-chip","cache storage;cryptography;graphics processing units;message authentication;multiprocessing systems","adaptive security support;CPU secure memory design;memory bandwidth contention;regular data;security metadata;security guarantees;heterogeneous GPU memory system;memory access patterns;GPU programming model;adaptive security memory support;read-only data;common streaming data access pattern;stream data;MAC access bandwidth;hardware-based detection;memory-intensive workloads;secure GPU memory;physical attack;message authentication code;on-chip shared counter;Bonsai Merkel Tree;BMT;L2 cache","","4","","34","IEEE","17 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A repetitive load flow analysis demands huge computational efforts like efficient system modelling for faster load flow solutions, parallel programming and High performance computing (HPC). In this paper, an N-1-1 CA has been analysed using fast decoupled load flow (FDLF) with a strategy of screening and ranking the catastrophic contingencies.

This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for dynamic small-signal stability assessment of power grids by estimating the region of attraction (ROA) for operating states in real time. By analyzing the latest sampling data of power grids in a fixed time window, an up-to-date training set is constructed with the aid of converse Lyapunov function, which enables us to develop an online learning approach based on Gaussian Process (GP) to assess the stability level of power grids. As a result, an iteration algorithm is designed to update the assessment parameters by learning the input-output pairs in the training set. Theoretical analysis is conducted to ensure the existence of converse Lyapunov function for differential-algebraic system that serves to describe power system dynamics, as well as to estimate the region of attraction for operating states with a given confidence level. In particular, a practical method is proposed to leverage time series of phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements including voltage/current magnitude, phase and frequency (i.e., PMU data) of real power grids for validating the online GP approach. Moreover, validations are taken to substantiate the proposed approach by using PMU data of real smart-grid infrastructure and IEEE test cases. The proposed assessment approach contributes to situational awareness of human operators in the control station, thereby taking proactive remedial actions prior to emergencies. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the problem of online assessment of power systems security but it also applies to other industrial control systems that have stable state trajectories. Existing approaches to security assessment of power systems generally focus on the adoption of various machine-learning algorithms by treating power grid as a “black box,” which ignores the intrinsic characteristics of power systems and thus restricts the inference performance. This paper proposes a new approach using limited sampling data and system dynamics to construct a domain of stability for power grids, which can reflect the evolution of security zones and provide more accurate predictions. In this work, we mathematically characterize the domain of stability for a practical power grid by analyzing and learning its state trajectories. Then we show how the proposed approach can be efficiently implemented online, which can timely alert human operators to abnormalities. Preliminary validations suggest that this approach is feasible and effective. In future research, we will incorporate it into an energy management system and test it in other industrial processes.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3173368","Nanyang Technological University (NTU)(grant numbers:SUG 001500-00001); National Research Foundation and Energy Market Authority (EMA), Singapore(grant numbers:NRF-EMA EMA-EP004-EKJGC-0003,MOE ARF Tier 1 2019-T1-001-119); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773283","Online Gaussian process;region of attraction;power systems stability;security assessment","Power system stability;Power system dynamics;Power grids;Security;Lyapunov methods;Stability criteria;Mathematical models","energy management systems;Gaussian processes;industrial control;learning (artificial intelligence);Lyapunov methods;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power grids;power system measurement;power system security;power system stability;smart power grids;time series","dynamic security assessment;dynamic small-signal stability assessment;electrical power grids;online small-signal stability assessment;power system dynamics;power systems security;practical power grid","","","","34","IEEE","12 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These resources communicate using complex on-chip interconnect networks that attempt to quickly and efficiently arbitrate memory transactions whose behaviors can vary drastically depending on the current mode of operation and system operating state. Security- and safety-critical applications require access control policies that define how these resources interact to ensure that malicious and unsafe behaviors do not occur. Aker is a design and verification framework for on-chip access control. The core of Aker is the access control wrapper (ACW)–a high-performance yet efficient hardware module that dynamically arbitrates on-chip communications. Aker distributes ACWs across the SoC and programs them to perform local access control. Aker provides a firmware generation tool and a property-driven security verification methodology to ensure that the ACWs are properly integrated and configured. Aker security verification confirms that the ACW behaves properly at IP level. It verifies the hardware root of trust firmware configures the ACW correctly. And it evaluates system-level security threats due to interactions between shared resources. Aker is experimentally validated on a Xilinx UltraScale+ programmable SoC. Additionally, an Aker access control system is integrated into the OpenPULP multicore archtiecture that uses OpenTitan hardware root-of-trust for firmware configuration.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2022.3209923","Intel Scalable Assurance Program; Semiconductor Research Corporation GRC Task(grant numbers:2993.001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9904916","Access control systems;system-on-chip architectures;security verification;safety-critical systems;security-critical systems","Access control;System-on-chip;Hardware;Microprogramming;IP networks;Engines;Safety","access control;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit interconnections;system-on-chip","access control system;access control wrapper;ACW;aker security verification;akeris;arbitrate memory transactions;custom accelerators;efficient hardware module;firmware generation tool configuration;malicious behaviors;on-chip access control;on-chip communications;on-chip interconnect networks;OpenTitan hardware root-of-trust;programmable SoC;property-driven security verification methodology;resource interaction;safety-critical applications;SoC access control systems;SoC programs;system operating state;system-level security threats;system-on-chip architectures;verification framework","","","","43","IEEE","28 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have argued that incorporating an explicit representation of the environment's topology enables reasoning on the location of assets being protected and the proximity of potentially harmful agents. This paper proposes to engineer topology aware adaptive security systems by identifying violations of security requirements that may be caused by topological changes, and selecting a set of security controls that prevent such violations. Our approach focuses on physical topologies; it maintains at runtime a live representation of the topology which is updated when assets or agents move, or when the structure of the physical space is altered. When the topology changes, we look ahead at a subset of the future system states. These states are reachable when the agents move within the physical space. If security requirements can be violated in future system states, a configuration of security controls is proactively applied to prevent the system from reaching those states. Thus, the system continuously adapts to topological stimuli, while maintaining requirements satisfaction. Security requirements are formally expressed using a propositional temporal logic, encoding spatial properties in Computation Tree Logic (CTL). The Ambient Calculus is used to represent the topology of the operational environment - including location of assets and agents - as well as to identify future system states that are reachable from the current one. The approach is demonstrated and evaluated using a substantive example concerned with physical access control.","2332-6441","978-1-4799-3033-3","10.1109/RE.2014.6912262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912262","","Security;Topology;Buildings;Calculus;Aerospace electronics;Servers;Runtime","authorisation;data flow analysis;formal specification;temporal logic","topology aware adaptive security engineering;requirements violation prevention;adaptive security systems;potentially harmful agents;security requirements;security controls;propositional temporal logic;encoding spatial properties;computation tree logic;ambient calculus;access control","","21","","24","IEEE","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the previous physically-isolated world, robust static security for selected matched problems was often sufficient. Today, we need a new approach to providing security, because even adaptive security is insufficient. This new approach is termed here a cognitive security system. The talk will cover three major issues. First, the talk starts from a review of the existing security systems, with their problems and required solutions, as well as their vulnerabilities, attacks, and defences. Second, it provides a review of decision-making systems, including dynamic and dynamical systems, complex systems, adaptive systems, autonomic systems and their attributes, symbiotic systems, and finally special attention is given to cognitive dynamic systems as defined by Wang's cognitive informatics [1-4], Kinsner cognitive machines, [5], Haikonen conscious machines [6], and Haykin cognitive dynamic systems [7].

The method not only classifies system operating conditions into a secure/insecure state but for an insecure operating state it also identifies the pertinent failure modes. The knowledge about the system operating conditions (patterns) are stored in a structured memory by grouping similar patterns into clusters which are then arranged into a hierarchical tree structure. This permits a fast two level search for the nearest neighbor.

Although in recent years significant progress has been achieved in biometric identification technology, the progress of single technologies does not dramatically improve the overall performance or solve the system-level problems of social security. Currently in addition to improvements of single technology, the following system-level technical bottlenecks must be solved to improve the overall performance of social security: 1. Blind spots of perception exist in surveillance area of due to the non-overlap of surveillance sensors, 2. The performance of single identification technology decreases sharply in complex surveillance scenarios such as poor lighting conditions or disguise, 3. Traditional warning technologies become invalid due to the multi-stage non-stationary evolution feature of complex events. Three challenges listed above closely relate to three scientific problems in the analysis technology of big visual data on three levels: sensing data, identification technology and pattern recognition. Our study aims at (1) exploiting the complete mapping mechanism between physical space and multivariate sensing spaces to fill-in the blind spots of sensing data, (2) exploring the correlative mechanism of multi-modal objects in multivariate sensing spaces to improve the analytical performance from single identification technology, (3) studying the spatial-temporal evolution mechanism in the entire lifecycle of complex events to extend pattern recognition from local space and time. The security space is the physical space with comprehensive protective ability, which includes ubiquitous sensing, reliable identification, penetrating trend analysis and approaching danger warning at any time, at any location, for any object and for any behavior. Aiming to build the theory of security space, this study is divided into three levels: information acquisition and perceptional computation, scene analysis and evolution prediction, resource scheduling and system applications. Then it is further divided into five tasks: (1) task 1: visual object recognition and big data based identification, (2) task 2: situational awareness of groups and multi-scale revolution, (3) task 3: semantic analysis of scenes and correlative computation in multivariate spaces, (4) task 4: big scale visual retrieval and security risk analysis, (5) task 5: Warning system of the security space and its applications. Task 1 corresponds to the first level because sensing and identification of objects is the basis for analysis. Task 2 and 3 correspond to the second level since group behavior, events, scene and their evolution are crucial for the prediction and warning of security events. Task 4 and 5 correspond to the third level of this study in order to develop the high performance computing platform, to conduct system evaluation and application demonstration. Big visual data contains massive high-dimensional sensing data, implying the complicated relationship among social objects. In fact, in the world of data, the spatial-temporal relationship between the big data objects is more essential than the causal relationship, and these private and implicit relationships compose the core values of the big data social analysis. Only the analysis of individuals, groups and scenes in big visual data are based on the core element of social security analysis, that is"" social structure and social activities"", can it supports the strategic transference of urban security system from investigation afterwards to warning in advance. The overall purpose of this study is to build the big data analysis system in security space, realizing the intelligent big visual data system which supports data analysis of hundred billions of feature data, billions of image data, millions of visual sensing terminals. The expected achievements on the warning and protection system for large spaces can reach the international leading level. Based on the achievements above, the project plans to develop 10 intelligent big data analysis products of 3 categories, and the expected benefits of industrialization promotion can reach 100 billion, which promotes the upstream and downstream industry to realize economic benefits 3 billion. Also we strive to become the internationally leading industry in the field of big security data analysis.","","978-1-5090-3677-6","10.1109/CBD.2016.065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7815231","big visual data;security space;social security","Security;Sensors;Visualization;Big data;Object recognition;Surveillance;Data analysis","Big Data;biometrics (access control);data analysis;data visualisation;pattern recognition;risk analysis;security of data;surveillance;ubiquitous computing","warning system;security risk analysis;big scale visual retrieval;semantic analysis;Big Data based identification;visual object recognition;system applications;resource scheduling;evolution prediction;scene analysis;perceptional computation;information acquisition;trend analysis penetration;reliable identification;ubiquitous sensing;pattern recognition;sensing data;social security;biometric identification technology;surveillance;seeing;security space;Big visual data analysis;key technology","","3","","","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, conventional anomaly detection methods are sensitive to the context of training datasets or the unpredicted phased changes of the testing datasets, or just consider the local density of the testing samples. Motivated by this problem, we transform the model learning problem to a distinction learning problem that learns the familiarity of each testing samples. In order to reduce the effects of the phased changes, we randomly shuffle the testing dataset and use a sliding window to evaluate the familiarity of the testing samples with one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) method.

Therefore, the use of reasonable spare inventory strategy, as well as maintenance and support decisions to systems is essential to improve system availability, security and system cost reducing. Maintenance strategy can be formulated based on the situation in which the products are monitored. For a single-component system, current research around its multi-state transferring have been quite mature, in which the conversion rate defined in a different state in Markov process can be clearly showed by conversion relationship between different state. However, the state transition process involved mostly considers the processes of repairing only, and rarely considers the impact to system availability by the transition of failure rate caused by changes in components, spare replacement strategies and spare supply. To solve this problem, this paper considered a single-component system with two derating states, and discussed its steady-state availability through variable spare replacement probability and different spare fill rate levels.

The focus of this project is a practical tool to help systems administrators verifiably enforce simple multi-layer network security policies. Our key design considerations are computational cost of policy validation and the power of the enforcement primitives. The central component is a policy engine populated by models of network elements and services that validates policies and computes new configuration settings for network elements when they are violated. We instantiate our policy enforcement tool using a monitoring and instrumentation layer that reports network changes as they occur and implements configuration changes computed by the policy engine.","","0-7695-1212-7","10.1109/DISCEX.2001.932156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=932156","","Power system security;Engines;Computer networks;Project management;Humans;Computer network management;Buildings;Computational efficiency;Power system modeling;Monitoring","computer network management;security of data;military computing;management of change","automatic network security policy management;DARPA Dynamic Coalitions program;dynamic networks;network reconfiguration system;negative invariants;positive invariants;multi-layer network security policies;computational cost;policy validation;enforcement primitives;monitoring layer;instrumentation layer;network changes;configuration changes","","33","12","23","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we explore the use of Bigraphical Reactive Systems to model the topology of cyber and physical spaces and their dynamics. We utilise such models to perform speculative threat analysis through model checking to reason about the consequences of the evolution of topological configurations on the satisfaction of security requirements.

The probability of success of most of these attacks mainly depends on their timeliness, as the degree of system vulnerabilities varies from time to time by changing its operating state. In this paper, we propose a new denial of service (DoS) attack strategy where the attackers leverage learning capabilities of convolutional neural networks in the encrypted domain to forecast the optimal time of launching a DoS attack. In our simulations Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is used to secure communication channels between phasor measurement units, phasor data concentrators, and the regional/national control center. It is illustrated that, despite providing confidential communication channels by IPsec-based security gateways, an attacker still can estimate the future operating state of the power system in advance. This gives an opportunity to the attackers for initiating an effective DoS attack. The proposed method is validated by the simulation results, which show a significant increase in the success rate of DoS attacks.","","978-1-6654-8032-1","10.1109/ISGT-Europe54678.2022.9960467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9960467","cyber-physical systems;encrypted data classification;denial of service attack;power system blackout;wide area monitoring system","Protocols;Power system protection;Communication channels;Power system stability;Feature extraction;Phasor measurement units;Data models","computer network security;convolutional neural nets;cyber-physical systems;deep learning (artificial intelligence);Internet;IP networks;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system measurement;power system security;protocols;telecommunication computing","cascading failure;confidential communication channels;convolutional neural networks;deep learning-based strategy;denial of service attack;effective DoS attack;Internet protocol security;IPsec-based security gateways;leverage learning capabilities;malicious attacks;national control center;phasor data concentrators;phasor measurement units;PMU-based cyber-physical power systems;regional control center;service attack strategy;system vulnerabilities;widespread blackout","","","","12","IEEE","28 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, this paper presents an approach to evaluate the impacts of the HVDC link outage on the reliability of interconnected power system considering the frequency regulation process during system contingencies. Firstly, a multi-state model of an HVDC link with different available loading rates (ALRs) is established based on its reliability network. Then, dynamic frequency response models of the inter- connected power system are presented and integrated with a novel frequency regulation scheme enabled by the HVDC link. The proposed scheme exploits the temporary overload capability of normal converters to compensate for the imbalanced power during system contingencies. Moreover, it offers frequency support that enables the frequency regulation reserves of the sending-end and receiving-end power systems to be mutually available. Several indices are established to measure the system reliability based on the given models in terms of abnormal frequency duration, frequency deviation, and energy losses of the frequency regulation process during system contingencies. Finally, a modified two-area reliability test system (RTS) with an HVDC link is adopted to verify the proposed approach.","2196-5420","","10.35833/MPCE.2021.000491","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51807173); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9682650","Reliability;multi-state modeling;interconnected power system;high-voltage direct current (HVDC) link;frequency regulation","HVDC transmission;Reliability;Power system reliability;Frequency control;Power systems;Power system stability;Maintenance engineering","frequency control;frequency response;HVDC power convertors;HVDC power transmission;power generation control;power grids;power system interconnection;power system security;reliability","abnormal frequency duration;dynamic frequency response models;frequency deviation;frequency regulation reserves;frequency regulation scheme;frequency security;frequency support;high-voltage direct current;HVDC link outage;HVDC links considering frequency regulation process;imbalanced power;interconnected power system;receiving-end power systems;reliability assessment;reliability network;reliability performances;system contingencies;system reliability;two-area reliability test system","","","","30","","14 Jan 2022","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

The proposed optimization approach strives to adapt the security measures to the trust level on the nodes on the path and factors in the security-related overhead in the link cost. In addition, a novel path rotation scheme is proposed to enable the use of resource-efficient security measures without risking an increase in vulnerability.

These architectural configuration changes have affect on the overall system quality attributes (i.e. performance, security and reliability). Therefore, modelling SoS architecture is a challenging task as CSs and the possible architectural configurations are not entirely known at design time. Architectural description languages (ADLs) have been proposed and used to deal with SoS dynamic architecture. However, we still envision gaps to be bridged and challenges to be addressed in the forthcoming years.

This interconnectivity enables new functionality but also new attack vectors.Today, agencies mostly rely on commercial security solutions providing adequate protection for commercial data services but have deficiencies when it comes to the Air Traffic Management (ATM) environment with its requirement for highest resilience, multi-level redundancies, and dynamic environment.This paper introduces a novel approach to create an ATM-grade baseline integrating operational security events (OSE) and alerts (OSA) based on abnormal or malicious network traffic. An assured and trusted baseline is key to detecting atypical or malicious traffic. A testbed has been developed that models the regular ATM-grade IP-network behavior. The sample configuration uses open source stacks ElastiFlow, and SELKS to provide network flow data collection and visualization and demonstrate resilience against hacking attempts via unauthorized communication and protocols between nodes, unauthorized configuration changes via distribution of parameters to network nodes, as well as detection of malicious communication attempts from unauthorized devices on the network. A Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture is chosen as it features a programmable, efficient network configuration improving network performance and monitoring. The OpenFlow protocol is used to provide the control plane in the testbed. Data flows will be modeled as synchronous as well as asynchronous. Vulnerabilities are then identified, attack scenarios defined and applied to the testbed setup. The available SDN platform tools are then used to detect the anomalies. Sets of experiments are performed and the results compared and discussed.","2155-4951","978-1-6654-3584-0","10.1109/ICNS52807.2021.9441630","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9441630","","Protocols;Navigation;Telecommunication traffic;Machine learning;FAA;Traffic control;Tools","air traffic control;aircraft navigation;authorisation;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;data visualisation;IP networks;protocols;redundancy;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","OpenFlow protocols;unauthorized configuration changes;network nodes;malicious communication attempts;unauthorized devices;software defined network architecture;programmable network configuration;efficient network configuration;network performance improvement;anomaly detection;Federal Aviation Administration;air navigation service providers;data service consumers;interconnectivity;attack vectors;commercial security solutions;commercial data services;air traffic management environment;multilevel redundancies;dynamic environment;ATM-grade baseline;operational security events;abnormal network traffic;malicious network traffic;atypical traffic;regular ATM-grade IP-network behavior;sample configuration;open source stacks;network flow data collection;data visualization;hacking attempts;unauthorized communication;ElastiFlow;ATM-grade software defined networks;Air Navigation Service Providers;operational security alerts;SELKS;network monitoring","","","","12","IEEE","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an adaptive security-aware scheduling system for packet switched networks using a real-time multi-agent design model. The proposed system combines real-time scheduling with security service enhancement. The scheduling unit uses the differentiated-earliest-deadline-first (Diff-EDF) scheduler and the security enhancement scheme adopts a congestion control mechanism. The required QoS is guaranteed for different types (audio and video) of real-time data flows, while the packet security levels are adaptively enhanced according to the feedbacks from the congestion control module. Compared with the IPsec protocol, the proposed scheme reduces the number of pending packets at the destinations. In implementation, the proposed scheme can overload the priority code point and the virtual-LAN identifier fields of the IEEE 802.1Q frame format, hence eliminating the overhead of the security associations performed by the IPsec protocol.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2013.071813.120299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565569","Multi-agent systems;quality of service (QoS);real-time scheduling;network security;resource estimation","Quality of service;Real-time systems;Scheduling;Multi-agent systems;Authentication;Packet switching","computer network security;local area networks;multi-agent systems;quality of service;real-time systems;scheduling;telecommunication congestion control","real-time scheduling;packet switched networks;real-time network applications;quality of service;timing constraints;security requirements;adaptive security-aware scheduling system;real-time multiagent design model;security service enhancement;differentiated-earliest-deadline-first scheduler;Diff-EDF scheduler;congestion control mechanism;packet security levels;pending packets;priority code point;virtual-LAN identifier fields;IEEE 802.1Q frame format","","12","","43","IEEE","23 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Remote access to IEDs or user interfaces in a substation for maintenance purposes is a common practice. However, there are potential cyber-physical system vulnerabilities in a substation, e.g., unsecured standard protocols, remote controllable IEDs, and unauthorized remote access to substation IEDs. In addition, some substation IEDs and user interfaces have a web server and hence it may provide a remote configuration change and control with default passwords. Even if firewalls and cryptography schemes are used for cyber security, weak security key management cryptography and mis-configured firewalls are still exposed to intruders. From IT point of view, cyber security issues are well known and new security technologies are available. However, security research on the integration of IT and physical power systems for critical infrastructures is still an emerging area. Intruders behaviors will generate logs across all substation-level networks, e.g., IEDs, firewalls and user interfaces. For instance, the steps of Stuxnet attack are based on: (1) intrusion attempts, (2) change of the file system, (3) change of target systems setting, and (4) change of target systems status. Therefore, anomaly detection is performed based on logs of intruders foot prints. Temporal anomaly can be determined from discrepancies between event logs from two different time periods. In the proposed anomaly index, a value of 0 implies no difference, whereas 1 indicates the maximal discrepancy [1]. In order to identify the impact of substation cyber intrusion to the power grid, cyber intrusion scenarios have been conducted on the substation IT network using a SCADA testbed at University College Dublin (UCD). The first intrusion scenario involves compromised substation gateway. A false signal is generated and an open circuit breaker (CB) command is sent to substation CBs. The second scenario is to generate forged CB status at the gateway. As a result of this attack, control center operators will observe fake data about the CB status. However, the actual substation CBs status has not changed. The third scenario is to generate fabricated analogue values to a control center using a man-in-the-middle attack. Once an intruder successfully compromises the substation LAN, (s)he is able to monitor and capture all measured data which comes from power grids. If attackers send fabricated data to the control center and the data travel through the state estimation filter, control center operators will observe an operational emergency. As a result, the operators may take emergency control actions such as reducing the generation voltage or reactive power while the power system is actually in a normal condition. There is a possibility these (logical) actions based on fabricated data will drive the system into a sequence of cascading events, leading to a power outage. Mitigation actions are conducted on substation IT and power grid. For IT mitigation, intrusion detection system (IDS) which uses anomaly detection algorithm based on temporal event construction has been used in a substation network. An Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm with an objective function that minimizes load shedding in the grid is used for power system mitigation. The proposed collaboration scheme between IDS and the firewall is able to disconnect intruders in the substation network. Emergency control actions are taken to mitigate the effects of cyber intrusions as an attempt to restore a system back to a normal condition.","1944-9925","978-1-4673-2729-9","10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345766","","Substations;Educational institutions;Circuit breakers;User interfaces;Computer security","cryptography;firewalls;Internet;load shedding;microprocessor chips;power grids;power system security;SCADA systems;substations;transport protocols;user interfaces;wide area networks","cyberphysical security;microprocessor based intelligent electronic devices;standardized protocol;TCP/IP;wide area networks;user interfaces;remote access;Web server;remote configuration;firewalls;key management cryptography;Stuxnet attack;intrusion attempts;anomaly detection;intruders foot prints;substation cyber intrusion;SCADA;substation gateway;open circuit breaker command;control center operators;man-in-the-middle attack;power grids;state estimation filter;IT mitigation;intrusion detection system;optimal power flow algorithm;objective function;load shedding;power system mitigation;emergency control","","2","","1","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the selection of security activities must be based on the priority of the criteria and adaptive. This paper addresses the adaptive security activities selection model as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) issue. Analytic Network Process (ANP) is proposed for weight calculation and criteria prioritization. Hypothetical examples were presented based on hard constraints faced by in-house web-based application development team in two different scenarios. The Decision Maker made the judgement by using the online ASAS model. The results show that experience, skill and knowledge get the highest priority in the first scenario while budget/ cost get the highest priority in the second scenario.

Combining information flow and risk analyses could make fault-mode evaluations for such devices more efficient and cost-effective. Conducting high-grade information security evaluations for computer communications devices is intellectually challenging, time-consuming, costly, and error prone. We believe that our structured approach can reveal potential fault modes because it simplifies evaluating a device's logical design and physical construction. By combining information-flow and risk-analysis techniques, evaluators can use the process to produce a thorough and transparent security argument. In other work, we have applied static analysis techniques to the evaluation problem, treating a device's schematic circuitry diagram as an information flow graph. This work shows how to trace information flow in different operating modes by representing connectivity between components as being conditional on specific device states. We have also developed a way to define the security-critical region of components with particular security significance by identifying components that lie on a path from a high-security data source to a low-security sink. Finally, to make these concepts practical, we have implemented them in an interactive analysis tool that reads schematic diagrams written in the very high speed integrated circuit (VHSIC) hardware description language.","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2006.161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631944","Security and protection;Data communications devices;Computer applications-military;Communications","Circuit faults;Information security;Military computing;Very high speed integrated circuits;Government;Military communication;Application software;Electronic components;Risk analysis;Computer errors","safety-critical software;fault diagnosis;hardware description languages;integrated circuit layout","fault-mode evaluation;security-critical communication devices;information security evaluation;risk-analysis techniques;transparent security argument;static analysis techniques;schematic circuitry diagram;information flow graph;very high speed integrated circuit;VHSIC;hardware description language","","6","","12","IEEE","15 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This paper reports the way in which a cyber attack can be performed to corrupt an available set of measurements associated with the operation of electronic-based controllers, namely the thyristor-controlled series compensator (TCSC) and static VAR compensator with a transformer (SVC-T), which jeopardizes the controller's secure operation if a control action is performed based on this false estimation of the operating state.

WAMS helps secure efficient energy transmission as well as reliable and optimal grid management. As the key enabler of a smart grid, numerous sensors such as PMU and current sensors transmit real-time dynamic data, which is usually protected by encryption algorithm from malicious attacks, over wide-area-network (WAN) to power system control centers so that monitoring and control of the whole system is possible. Security algorithms for power grid need to consider both performance and energy efficiency through code optimization techniques on encryption and decryption. In this paper, we take power nodes (sites) as platforms to experimentally study ways of energy consumptions in different security algorithms. First, we measure energy consumptions of various security algorithms on CrossBow and Ember sensor nodes. Second, we propose an array of novel code optimization methods to increase energy consumption efficiency of different security algorithms.

Without security protection, all NextGen functions will be vulnerable to various attacks and cannot work robustly. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Aviation Security (IAS) framework for defense-in-depth of various aspects of NextGen security such as cyber security and aircraft anti-hijacking.

Unfortunately, as we show, existing counterexample-guided algorithms can perform poorly if the system model allows configuration changes during execution.

The power deficit usually results after generator outage or failure of the other means of ensuring the operational reserve. RR consists of rapid start-up generating units such as gas turbines and hydro plants. Due to the stochastic nature of the power system operation, the amount of ready reserve is essential for balancing the power system operating states in perturbed conditions. For that purpose, an ANN using back-propagation learning rule could yield the amount of ready reserve. Prompt assessment of the appropriate amount of RR minimizes the potential reduction of quality of electrical energy delivered to customers and, consequently, maintains a high reliability of the power system as a whole.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.801944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=801944","","Power generation;Power system security;Power system interconnection;Power system reliability;Power system stability;Power systems;Hydraulic turbines;Spinning;Character generation;Thermal management","power system reliability;power system analysis computing;neural nets;backpropagation;compensation","on-line determination;ready reserve power;artificial neural network;power deficit compensation;power systems;generator outage;rapid start-up generating units;gas turbines;hydro plants;stochastic nature;power system operation;power system operating states balancing;perturbed conditions;back-propagation learning rule;electrical energy quality reduction;high reliability;spinning reserve;stochastic-deterministic model","","15","","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper innovatively proposes a method for determining the limit scale of DPPT considering the operating constraints of power systems. The method is implemented by a bi-level optimization model. Specifically, the upper level problem is the market clearing model of DPPT, while the lower level problem is the operating constraint-based security check model.

The DACS scheme performs the network services efficiently through the communication management of a client. As the characteristic of DACS scheme, only the setup modification is required by a system administrator, when the configuration change is needed in the network server. Then, the setup modification is unnecessary by a customer, which shows a merit for both a system administrator and a customer.

For relation extraction of Chinese internet financial intelligence, the existing models are all based on single-modal text semantics ignoring the role of Chinese pictographic semantics, while the shape and structure of Chinese characters contains useful semantics. In addition, the pictographic semantic fusion method of Chinese text also needs to be improved for better performance. To solve these shortcomings, we propose a Chinese Multimodal Relation Extraction model (CMRE), which improves the relation extraction ability on the Chinese internet financial intelligence. In CMRE, we extract pictographic semantics based on Chinese character shape and structure. Furthermore, we design a novel multi-modal semantic fusion module based on improved Transformer to effectively fuse the text and pictographic semantics. Additionally, we design experiments on the Chinese literature dataset(Sanwen) to test the relation extraction capability of CMRE.

This growth has made the present day systems very big and complex. The complexity is arising especially due to many Interconnections, different types of loads and larger generating units. Also there is uncertainty in load forecasting. With EHV interconnections the disturbances are felt even in geographically distant parts of the system, increasing the severity of the disturbances. These factors make the satisfactory operating of the system a more difficult task. Added to this, Society is becoming more dependent on electric power; and it is essential to make the power available to customers without any interruption and within certain limits of voltage and frequency variations. This means that there is a great need to ensure that a system is as economical, reliable and secure as possible [1]. High reliability of the system is usually obtained by following the principles of bulk power supply planning. However, due to delay in commissioning of new plants and equipment, equipment outages, unexpected load demands and disturbances, the system may be forced to operate in or close to critical and emergency conditions. Hence, in addition to sophisticated planning and designing of the system, an effective operation and control of power systems is essential. The maintenance of a system in a reliable and secure mode is becoming an Important part of the Job of the operators. In the past, more emphasis was given to economic operation; but in view of the consequences of power failures, reliable and secure operation of the system is being given more importance. Security assessment deals with the tracking of the system and deciding whether the present state is secure or not. If the system's state is found to be insecure, it forewarns the operator to take possible remedial action or to be ready for the disturbance if it takes place. This is done before any disturbance (which may lead to failure or deterioration in the quality of supply) occurS. Thus security evaluation is essentially an on-line procedure. The paper will discuss the different operating states of a power system, system security and different approaches for transient security assessment. Recent research results applying the pattern recognition approach will be summarized and presented.","","","10.1109/CDC.1975.270572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4045489","","Power system security;Pattern recognition;Power system reliability;Power system interconnection;Power system planning;Power system economics;Power generation economics;Economic forecasting;Power system control;Power system transients","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, legal regulations have also become effective that require automobile manufacturers to set up a monitoring system for fleet-wide security analysis. The growing amount of software, networking, and the automation of driving create new challenges for security. Context-awareness, situational understanding, adaptive security, and threat intelligence are necessary to cope with these ever-increasing risks. In-vehicle security should be adaptive to secure the car in an infinite number of (driving) situations.

Isolation of tenants is essential for a stable and secure operation of a factory. Application upgrades and novel software enable faster innovation cycles. Secure remote management allows more outsourcing to third parties but leads to continuously changing factory networks. Mobile or even autonomous devices again add complexity. However, current factory owners are conservative for good reasons: changing a well-designed system is costly and may cause failures and outages of the production lines. The virtual tenant network (VTN) concept addresses this conflict by means of combining network virtualization, hardware virtualization, cloud technologies and IT automation. Thus, tenants are isolated and configuration changes or security breaches in one tenant will not affect others. The concept at hand borrows from data center technology but adopts those ideas to the embedded world of industrial networks.","","978-1-7281-0568-0","10.1109/NetSys.2019.8854508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854508","virtual tenant network;edge-cloud;multi-tenant;industrial communication","Production facilities;Couplings;Cloud computing;Quality of service;Security;Stakeholders;Virtualization","cloud computing;computer centres;factory automation;mobile computing;virtualisation","stable operation;secure operation;application upgrades;secure remote management;factory networks;network virtualization;configuration changes;security breaches;multitenant networks;automation industry;future industrial networks;innovation cycles;autonomous devices;virtual tenant network concept","","","","12","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In distributed real-time embedded applications, e.g., electric grid management and command and control applications, it is required to not only meet real-time constraints but also support the data confidentiality,integrity, and authenticity. Unfortunately, in general, cryptographic functions are computationally expensive, possibly causing deadline misses in real-time embedded systems with limited resources. As a basis for cost-effective security support in real-time embedded systems, we define a quantitative notion of Strength of Defense (SoD). Based on the SoD concept, we propose a novel adaptive security policy in which the SoD can be degraded by decreasing the cryptographic key length for certain tasks, if necessary, to improve the success ratio under overload conditions. Our approach is lightweight. The time complexity of our approach is linear and its amortized version has the constant overhead per SoD adaptation period. Moreover, our approach supports desirable security features requiring an attacker to do extra work to find the cryptographic key. In the performance evaluation, we show that our approach can considerably improve the success ratio due to controlled SoD degradation under overload.","2325-1301","0-7695-2676-4","10.1109/RTCSA.2006.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1691312","","Real time systems;Embedded system;Cryptography;Embedded computing;Degradation;Power system security;Computer science;Application software;Control systems;Intelligent networks","computational complexity;cryptography;data integrity;embedded systems;message authentication;scheduling","distributed real-time embedded system;data confidentiality;data integrity;data authenticity;cryptographic key;cost-effective adaptive security policy;strength of defense concept;time complexity","","5","1","22","IEEE","11 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, in the proposed architecture, all generators in the MG operate as either voltage regulators (active agents), or current sources (passive agents), with their operating mode being determined by software-defined MG control supported by the control plane communication performed over the power bus. For the purpose of control plane communication, we adopt power talk, a modem-less, low-rate, and power-line communication solution designed for direct current MGs.

"Security-constrained unit commitment using Mixed-Integer Programming with Benders Decomposition","Nalan Laothumyingyong; Parnjit Damrongkulkamjorn","Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand; Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand","ECTI-CON2010: The 2010 ECTI International Confernce on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology","24 Jun 2010","2010","","","626","630","The objective of this paper is to determine the 24-hour unit commitment with minimum total generation cost subjecting to power flow constraints in both normal operating state and contingency state, which is considered the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC). In this paper, the Benders' Decomposition technique has been applied by decomposing the problem into two parts: the master problem; and the subproblems. The master problem which is the unit commitment problem contains integer variables as the on-off status of the generating units, and therefore could be solved as Mixed-Integer Programming problem. The branch-and-cut method has been chosen to solve the master mixed-integer problem. There are two subproblems considered in this research: the power flow mismatch equations; and the operating limits of power systems. If the conditions in any subproblems are violated, the Benders Cuts corresponding to the violated constraints are added to the master problem and the mixed-integer unit commitment problem could be resolved. The proposed algorithm is tested on the IEEE 57-bus system with 7 thermal generating units. The 24-hour load data is made available along with the additional data for generating units. The results of typical unit commitment, security-constrained unit commitment under normal operating states and SCUC with contingency states are compared. The results show that the total generating costs of SCUC with contingency are higher than the others. However the committed units of that SCUC ensure that the system could still serve load when contingency occurs.","","978-1-4244-5607-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491412","","Power generation;Load flow;Mathematical model;Power engineering and energy;Equations;System testing;Power system simulation;Power system planning;Cost function;Power systems","integer programming;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power generation scheduling;power system security","security-constrained unit commitment;mixed-integer programming;Benders decomposition;integer variables;branch-and-cut method;power flow mismatch equation;IEEE 57-bus system;generation units","","1","","11","","24 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By leveraging intrinsic hardware characteristics, we aim to design a computationally lightweight security software system architecture so that complex cryptography computation can dramatically be prohibited. We exploit the innovative idea of Public Physical Unclonable Functions (PPUFs) that fundamentally protects attackers from recovering the secret key from public gate delay information. We implement its hardware logic in a real-world FPGA board. On top of the PPUF fingerprint hardware, we present an adaptive security control mechanism consisting of adaptive key generation and key exchange protocol, which adjusts security strength depending on system load dynamics. We demonstrate that our PPUF FPGA implementation embeds distinctive variability enough to distinguish between two different PPUFs with high fidelity. We validate our PUFSec architecture by implementing necessary algorithms and protocols in a real-world IoT platform, and performing empirical evaluation in terms of computation and memory usages, proving its practical feasibility.","","978-1-5090-5336-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057146","","Hardware;Logic gates;Delays;Cryptography;Software;Radiation detectors","cryptographic protocols;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;Internet of Things;private key cryptography;public key cryptography;telecommunication security","low-end embedded platform;security enhancement;computation overhead;IoT devices;intrinsic hardware characteristics;computationally lightweight security software system architecture;complex cryptography computation;Public Physical Unclonable Functions;secret key;public gate delay information;hardware logic;real-world FPGA board;PPUF fingerprint hardware;adaptive security control mechanism;adaptive key generation;key exchange protocol;security strength;system load dynamics;PPUF FPGA implementation;PUFSec architecture;real-world IoT platform;device fingerprint-based security architecture;Internet of Things","","9","","13","IEEE","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of its most valuable features is its threat detection function which is available on every version of the firewall running a software version of 8.0(2) or higher. Threat detection operates at layers 3 and 4 to determine a baseline for network traffic, analysing packet drop statistics and generating threat reports based on traffic patterns. Despite producing a large volume of statistical information relating to several security events, further effort is required to mine and visually report more significant information and conclude the security status of the network. There are several commercial off-the-shelf tools available to undertake this task, however, they are expensive and may require a cloud subscription. Furthermore, if the information transmitted over the network is sensitive or requires confidentiality, the involvement of a third party or a third-party tool may place organisational security at risk. Therefore, this paper presents a fuzzy logic aided intelligent threat detection solution, which is a cost-free, intuitive and comprehensible solution, enhancing and simplifying the threat detection process for all. In particular, it employs a fuzzy reasoning system based on the threat detection statistics, and presents results/threats through a developed dashboard user interface, for ease of understanding for administrators and users. The paper further demonstrates the successful utilisation of a fuzzy reasoning system for selected and prioritised security events in basic threat detection, although it can be extended to encompass more complex situations, such as complete basic threat detection, advanced threat detection, scanning threat detection, and customised feature based threat detection.","","978-1-5090-6020-7","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2018.8491574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491574","","Firewalls (computing);Feature extraction;Fuzzy logic;Tools;Monitoring;Fuzzy reasoning","computer crime;firewalls;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;organisational aspects;user interfaces","organisational networks;valuable features;threat detection function;software version;network traffic;analysing packet drop statistics;traffic patterns;statistical information;significant information;security status;third-party tool;organisational security;fuzzy logic;intelligent threat detection solution;comprehensible solution;threat detection process;fuzzy reasoning system;threat detection statistics;prioritised security events;complete basic threat detection;advanced threat detection;customised feature based threat detection;Cisco adaptive security appliance 5500 series firewall","","15","","28","Crown","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, failures of any network component, such as a transmission line or power generator, can be critical to the overall grid operation. The security constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) aims for the long term precontingency operating state, such that in the event of any contingency, the power grid will remain secure. For a realistic power network, however, with numerous contingencies considered, the overall problem size becomes intractable for single-core optimization tools in short time frames established by real-time industrial operations. We propose a parallel distributed memory structure exploiting framework, BELTISTOS-SC, which accelerates the solution of SCOPF problems over state of the art techniques. The acceleration on single-core execution is achieved by a structure-exploiting interior point method, employing successive Schur complement evaluations to further reduce the size of the systems solved at each iteration while maintaining sparsity, resulting in lower computational resources for the linear system solution. Additionally the parallel, distributed memory implementation of the proposed framework is also presented in detail and validated through several large-scale examples, demonstrating its efficiency for large-scale SCOPF problems.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2942964","Swiss Innovation Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8846109","Security constraints;optimal power flow;non-linear programming;interior point method;parallel algorithms","Generators;Security;Power transmission lines;Optimization;Power grids;Acceleration;Linear programming","distributed memory systems;iterative methods;load flow;optimisation;power engineering computing;power grids;power system security;renewable energy sources","single-core optimization tools;real-time industrial operations;parallel distributed memory structure exploiting framework;linear system solution;large-scale SCOPF problems;security constrained optimal power flow problems;renewable energy;power grid equipment;transmission line;power generator;long term precontingency operating state;realistic power network;two level parallel augmented Schur complement interior-point algorithms;BELTISTOS-SC;iteration method","","15","","34","IEEE","23 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As an ideal unconditional secure technique, OTP requires the key rate the same as the information rate. However, comparing with high speed information traffic (Gbps), the key generation rate of QKD is very poor(Kbps). Therefore, in practical QKD networks, it is difficult to support numerous applications and multiple users simultaneously. To address this issue, we argue that it is more practical to provide quality of security instead of OTP in quantum networks. We further propose ASM, an Adaptive Security Selection Mechanism for quantum networks based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). In ASM, services can select an appropriate encryption algorithm that satisfies the proper security level and performance metrics under the limit of the key generation rate. We also implement ASM under our RT-QKD platform, and evaluate its performance.

The video coding community considers this problem in the context of transcoding media streams, but their approaches either fail to address authentication or fail to provide meaningful security guarantees. We present two provably-secure schemes, LISSA and TRESSA, that allow an intelligent network intermediary to intercept a stream signed by a content provider, and adapt it dynamically, while preserving the ultimate receiver's ability to securely verify the content provider's signature (and, hence, authenticity and integrity of the data received). Our schemes allow the intermediary to selectively remove portions of the stream and, thus, permit common media transcoding techniques such as scalable compression and multiple file switching. Moreover, a content provider only has to encode and sign its entire data stream once, as opposed to nondynamically encoding and signing different versions for each anticipated combination of device, network configuration, and channel condition.

The method, suitable for real-time applications, is demonstrated using the Slovenian power-system model for first-swing stability issues. The presented demonstration is segmented into a few parts. First, a database containing a set of pre-fault operating conditions (represented by a measurement matrix) and critical clearing times corresponding to several contingencies is constructed. Measurements matrix from the database is decomposed using the principal component analysis method and represented in a coordinate system defined by the principal components as dense clusters of points. Consequentially, monitoring real-time steady-state conditions in terms of seeking similarity to existing database clusters is facilitated (global screening). This is established by identifying the shortest Euclidean distance metric in the mentioned coordinate system. Finally, a second-stage (local) screening is applied in order to adaptively account for the fluctuating sensitivity of contingencies to variations in pre-fault operating conditions. In this manner, an accurate indication of each contingency impact is provided rapidly as long as a similar operating state exists within the database. Otherwise, the case is thoroughly investigated and added to the database as a new entry. This approach is applicable to a wide spectrum of dynamic problems, considering that problem-relevant sets of input data are available.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2919652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8723513","Adaptive;contingency;database;data mining;power-system stability;principal component;screening","Databases;Power system stability;Principal component analysis;Real-time systems;Matrix decomposition;Data mining","data mining;pattern clustering;power engineering computing;power system faults;power system security;power system transient stability;principal component analysis","real-time application;indirect power-system contingency screening method;adaptive PCA;data-mining method;indirect contingency screening;power-system operating conditions;Slovenian power-system model;first-swing stability issues;pre-fault operating conditions;measurement matrix;measurements matrix;principal component analysis method;real-time steady-state conditions;database clusters;global screening;coordinate system;second-stage screening;contingency impact;operating state","","4","","28","IEEE","28 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, identification of suitable locations, where the effect of these FACTs devices will be most beneficial to the network, has been a growing concern to electric power utilities in planning and operation of power systems. Consequently, a safe and reliable power system operation requires that all operating states, which could be used to enhance power system operation such as voltage profile enhancement and loss reduction, must be quickly detected and identified. This paper, therefore, introduces a Line Strength Index (LSI) for identifying suitable locations where reactive power supports such as Thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) could be located for voltage profile enhancement and transmission loss reduction within the system. Furthermore, the influence of TCSC placement on the voltage profile and transmission losses is investigated. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a simple 6-bus power network. The results obtained are compared with that obtained when TCSC is placed at a randomly selected location. This shows that the integrity of a stressed power network, in terms of security and reliability, could be easily enhanced through the application of TCSC whose placement is determined by LSI, a non-iterative-based approach.","","978-1-5386-7709-4","10.1109/CTEMS.2018.8769127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8769127","voltage profile;transmission loss;thyristor-controlled series capacitor;coupling strength matrix;line strength index","Thyristors;Power capacitors;Reactive power;Large scale integration;Power transmission lines;Propagation losses","electricity supply industry;flexible AC transmission systems;power capacitors;power system security;power transmission planning;power transmission reliability;reactive power;thyristors","voltage profile enhancement;transmission loss reduction;TCSC placement;identifying suitable locations;reactive power;electric power utilities;operating states;power system operation;FACT devices;power system planning;LSI;thyristor-controlled series capacitor;system reliability;line strength index;noniterative-based approach;system security;6-bus power network operation","","1","","21","IEEE","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed model focuses on static security analysis, where the main objective is to access the existing operating state of the system. If the state is found to be secure, contingency analysis is performed to evaluate system vulnerability and time necessary to obtain such results. This time is compared to traditional computational techniques to evaluate static security of a power system.

These substations are remotely operated by two Operating Centers - Transmission Operating Center (COT Centro de Operacao da Transmissao), Bom Jardim SP, and Back-end Operating Center (COR - Centro de Operacao Retaguarda), Cabreiiva SP. Through the years, CTEEP has been deploying its high reliability and throughput WAN/LAN to connect all of its key facilities. Based on such corporate network infrastructure, it was possible to provide remote operations with a visual, real time monitoring system. Its structure comprises cameras installed in substation strategic spots, local digital image recorder and devices to convert and regulate video streams and control cameras, and Ethernet network interfaces. The system allows visual checking of operating handling, physical status of substation yard, and perimeter integrity thus addressing many corporative areas' needs. Since there is a high reliability, high throughput corporative network infrastructure available to connect main facilities, it enable us to provide remote substation operations with support of a visual, real time monitoring system, which comprises camera movement control, tamper-proof recording, image transmission and viewing, both locally and remotely. SIM - Sistema Integrado de Monitoramento (Integrated Monitoring System) is a joint project among CTEEP's Enterprise Security, Information Technology, and Maintenance and Operations organizations. It aims to deploy a visual monitoring system for electrical substations providing camera movement control, tamper-proof recording, image transmission and viewing, both locally and remotely using existent corporative network (""browser-based""). It allows electrical system operations and enterprise security organizations to monitor substations and other CTEEP facilities through images transmitted via data channels (corporative network), which are enabled by heterogeneous technologies and throughput, from frame relay (64Kbs to 512Kbps) to fiber optic/digital radio links (2Mbps). By promoting integration of video, audio, and text information, and by associating it to company existing databases, SIM also meets CTEEP's strategic goals related to information system integration (technological convergence). In addition to align strategic information integration goals, SIM deployment will provide CTEEP Electrical Transmission System operators with environmental viewing of facilities in a real-time, strategic way, enabling an improvement of operating processes. SIM usage means lower costs related to staff displacement to remotely assisted substations, either for equipment handling checking, equipment current status checking or substation areas physical integrity checking. All of these intended to optimize access to substations risk areas. Also, note that such solution means lower operating and maintenance costs for entire company due to its standardization.","","978-1-4577-0488-8","10.1109/TDC-LA.2010.5762915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5762915","Information Integration;Visual;Real Time Monitoring;Substation Remote Operation;Enterprise Security;Operating Security","Substations;Cameras;Monitoring;Visualization;Security;Real time systems;Streaming media","computerised monitoring;local area networks;power engineering computing;substation automation;wide area networks","real-time monitoring system;remote operation;electrical substations;WAN-LAN;local digital image recorder;video streams;control cameras;Ethernet network interfaces;corporative network infrastructure;camera movement control;tamper-proof recording;image transmission;frame relay;fiber optic links;digital radio links;equipment handling checking;equipment current status checking;substation areas physical integrity checking;operating security;CTEEP;transmission operating center;back-end operating center;remote substation operations;integrated monitoring system;visual monitoring system","","4","","6","IEEE","5 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This leads to open and outsourcing all or part of their information system (IS) to create collaborative processes by composing business services picked in each partner IS and to take advantage of Cloud computing. Business services outsourcing and their dynamic collaboration context can bring lost of control on IS and new security risks can occur. This leads to inconsistent protection allowing competitors to access to unauthorized information. To address this issue, systematic security service invocations may be added, without paying attention to the business context leading to costly over protection. To address this issue, an adaptive security service model deployment is required to provide a business service consistent protection by taking into account the collaboration context (business service data criticity, partners involved in the collaboration, etc.), and the cloud deployment and execution environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security model based on MDS@run.time, the marriage of Model Driven Security (MDS) and Models@run.time approaches, allowing to select at runtime the appropriate security components to apply. The MDS approach is used to generate security policies, which are interpreted at runtime and load appropriate security mechanisms depending on the context (which takes advantage of the Models@run.time approach) ensuring business process end to end protection. A proof of concept prototype is built on top of the OW2 FraSCAti middleware, validating our proposition efficiency. Our experiments and simulations show that MDS@run.time improves the system efficiency when the over-protection risk rate increases.","","978-1-4799-8356-8","10.1109/SOSE.2015.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133513","","Context;Business;Authentication;Context modeling;Middleware;Collaboration","cloud computing;groupware;information systems;middleware;outsourcing;risk management;security of data;software performance evaluation","service protection optimization;model driven security@run.time;MDS@run.time;collaborative business;information system;business services outsourcing;dynamic collaboration context;cloud computing;security risks;adaptive security service model deployment;business service consistent protection;business service data criticity;cloud deployment;execution environment;Models@run.time;security policy generation;OW2 FraSCAti middleware;system efficiency improvement;over-protection risk rate","","2","","29","IEEE","25 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome the problems in unimodal biometrics and to increase the level of security multimodal biometrics is used. Multimodal biometrics is of different types, multi algorithmic, multi instance and multi sensorial. This paper introduces a new personal identification framework that is based on the fusion of face and fingerprint biometrics. Face is being processed using two algorithms, Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to reduce the recognition error. After being processed by LDA, output of LDA is provided to PCA. Then fingerprint is processed using crossing number based method. Finally output from PCA and fingerprint are combined using matching score based on sum rule.

Two modes of UPFC operation, an economic mode and a secure mode are proposed according to operating objectives and states. In the economic mode, both the generation cost and the active power loss have been minimized by active and reactive power control of UPFC's. In the secure mode, the security index J relating to line flows and bus voltages has been minimized by operation of UPFC's. A decoupled model has been utilized as a mathematical model to evaluate the effect of an UPFC on a system. For verification of the proposed operation scheme, numerical simulations have been performed on a 10-unit, 39-bus New England System equipped with 3 UPFC's.","","0-7803-7518-1","10.1109/PESS.2002.1043312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1043312","","Power system economics;Power generation economics;Mathematical model;Power systems;Power generation;Costs;Reactive power control;Power system security;Voltage;Power system modeling","flexible AC transmission systems;power transmission control;power transmission economics;load flow control;optimal control;control system synthesis;reactive power control","FACTS control design;flexible AC transmission system;operating objectives;operating states;unified power flow controllers;UPFC;economic mode;secure mode;generation cost;active power loss;active power control;reactive power control;mathematical model;numerical simulations","","13","","8","IEEE","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Security agents, such as cops, use public camera footage to track down the accused's movements. People are assigned to this responsibility of watching the public camera recordings. These individuals must constantly watch the detected faces and compare them to the accused faces. However, because this is a continual process, there is a high risk of manual errors when utilizing this method. The accused person's face can also be discovered using this method, but by the time the assigned person tells the nearest police station, the accused person may have left/escaped. With all of these considerations in mind, it is necessary to avoid these blunders. Manual mistake in determining the perpetrator's face and relaying the information to officials swiftly are the main problems. Installing a camera with an already supplied data collection of suspected people can help cross-check the detected faces with the uploaded data set, which is the first issue. This improves the precision of the accused's detection. The second issue is telling officials about the suspected criminal or accused in a timely manner. If the installed camera has a transmitting unit, with the receiver on the official side and the transmitter on the camera end, this will work. The information is swiftly transmitted to the authorities, and there is a good possibility that the perpetrator will be apprehended. A frequency band is fundamental for any transmission to actually occur. The frequency ranges essential for the above-mentioned transferring data are 400–500 Hz and 900–1000 Hz. The LoRa module will be used to use these bandwidths.","","978-1-6654-7719-2","10.1109/IATMSI56455.2022.10119278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10119278","LoRa;Transmission;Arduino;criminal detection","Training;Technological innovation;Transmitters;Tracking;Manuals;Watches;Cameras;Web servers;Textile antennas;Faces","cameras;face recognition;police data processing;surveillance","burglary;camera end;crimes;criminals;frequency 400.0 Hz to 500.0 Hz;frequency 900.0 Hz to 1000.0 Hz;LoRa module;manual mistake;nearest police station;officials;perpetrator;public camera footage;public camera recordings;security agents;supplied data collection;thefts","","","","15","IEEE","15 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Individual transforms like DCT, Walsh, Kekre and Haar and their combinations resulting in hybrid transforms, hybrid two-resolution wavelets and hybrid multi-resolution wavelets have been applied to each biometric. Energy compaction of these transforms and wavelets has been used to generate feature vectors.

A new assessment method which uses the credibility measure to establish the probability of component failure and global fuzzy security index to measure the severity of the accident is proposed.

Moreover, its executive software executes unnoticed by any other component in the system, including operating systems and hypervisors. For that reason, SMM has been exploited in the past to facilitate attacks, misuse, or alternatively, building security tools capitalising on its resources. In this paper, we discuss how the use of the SMM has been contributing to the arms race between system's attackers and defenders. We analyse the main work published on attacks, misuse and implementing security tools in the SMM and how the SMM has been modified to respond to those issues.

However, network providers are incapable of handling all types of attacks as each security device is designed for a certain purpose. If an attack breaks out, only one particular device becomes busy in terms of resource usage while others being idle. Moreover, it is hard to adjust a level of security service with respect to the importance of network flow. To address these issues, we propose a new security solution, QoSE, which provides adaptive security services based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV). QoSE provides a capability to manage resource usage that the network flow is not concentrated on a specific node. We design QoSE considering a distributed NFV environment to avoid a single point of failure and a bottleneck problem. Our proposed solution has also shown a quick recovery from fault situation.

In the first stage, with day-ahead PV and load predictions, the central controller (CC) performs optimal power flow (OPF) to determine the hourly dispatch of on-load tap changers (OLTC) and capacitor banks (CBs). In the second stage, the ADN is partitioned into different zones only based on PV and load types. The zone controllers (ZC), which is formulated by deep neural networks (DNN), then communicate with their neighbors and track the optimal total reactive power support of PVs in each zone. In the offline training process, an analytical derivation to minimize power losses is also provided that can help the input and output selection of DNN. To online dispatch reactive power for individual utility-scale and customer-owned PVs in corresponding zones, a multi-mode reactive power allocation strategy is proposed. Three different modes namely loss reduction mode (LRM), fair power sharing mode (FPM) and voltage security mode (VSM) are designed to meet varying operation requirements, which can mitigate voltage violations with fair participation for customers and reduced power losses for system operators. Numerical simulations are performed on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in finding a trade-off between voltage security and loss minimization with fairness.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2022.3213587","ARC Research Hub(grant numbers:IH180100020); ARC Training Centre(grant numbers:IC200100023); ARC Linkage Project(grant numbers:LP200100056); ARC(grant numbers:DP220103881); Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Key Program)(grant numbers:71931003,72061147004); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72171206); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9916057","Combined central and distributed;deep neural networks;multi-mode reactive power allocation;Volt/Var control;customer-owned PVs","Voltage control;Reactive power;Optimization;Capacitors;Voltage measurement;Training;Security","deep learning (artificial intelligence);load flow control;load forecasting;numerical analysis;on load tap changers;photovoltaic power systems;power distribution control;power engineering computing;power generation control;power generation dispatch;power grids;power system security;reactive power control;voltage control","active distribution networks;ADN;capacitor banks;central controller;customer-owned photovoltaic system;day-ahead PV;deep neural networks;dispatch reactive power;DNN;IEEE 33-bus distribution system;load predictions;load types;loss minimization;loss reduction mode;multimode reactive power allocation strategy;numerical simulations;offline training process;on-load tap changers;optimal power flow;optimal total reactive power support;power losses;power sharing mode;system operators;two-stage combined central and distributed Volt-Var control strategy;utility-scale;voltage regulation;voltage security;voltage security mode;voltage violations;zone controllers","","","","33","IEEE","11 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this regard, this paper proposes an energy management optimization method for DC microgrids including photovoltaics and hybrid energy storage, which can quickly stabilize the bus voltage fluctuations caused by the imbalance of system power supply and demand. In the grid-connected state, the DC microgrid exchanges energy with the large grid through the grid-connected converter; in the off-grid state, the photovoltaic module and the hybrid energy storage module coordinate and cooperate to supply power to the local load, avoiding the small-scale fluctuation of the DC bus voltage.

The secret keys are generated adaptively using correlated channel estimation, which reckons on the randomness in the environment and does not require the secrecy of data transferred during the process. This concept is extended in UWA channels with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems and implements a protocol to generate secret keys adaptively based on the channel frequency response (CFR). A secret key generated from the CFR estimation manages the channel coding system, namely a turbo-code. This scheme allows to jointly performing an error control and adaptive coding in only one step. This scheme allows an adaptive security coding without change of the hardware structure of the transceiver devices.

This has been demonstrated by a growing number of new encryption algorithms, more intelligent firewall and intrusion detection techniques, new developments in multifactor authentication, advances in malware protection and many more. During a similar period of time the industry has seen the need for network infrastructure which provides a greater degree of trust which has resulted in the development of forensic analysis tools which meet the requirements of law enforcement agencies. Such tools must provide for commercial intelligence and national security. This paper proposes that application of the common ground between security and forensics has great potential to provide for improvements in the effort to achieve real-time adaptive security. This implies an architecture which can detect security breaches and in real-time record and analyse traffic logs in a forensically sound manner, provide corrective feedback to security devices and attempt to trace back to the source of the attack. In addressing computer security and forensic analysis from a real-time perspective, this paper recognises that some of these processes already exist, but proposes methods whereby the ongoing damage and potential risk to critical infrastructure can be reduced. This requires the implementation of a highly integrated approach to security and forensics such that they can inter-work in real-time in order to address the significant security issues which currently face the industry.","","978-1-4244-8484-3","10.1109/NSS.2010.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635616","critical infrastructure;network forensics;real-time adaptive security","Security;Forensics;Fires;Real time systems;Servers;Computer architecture;Adaptive systems","authorisation;computer forensics;real-time systems","network security design;intrusion detection techniques;firewall;multifactor authentication;forensic analysis tools;real-time adaptive security","","3","","11","IEEE","15 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A biometric system works by collecting important biological or behavioural traits of the prospective user. Extracted traits are stored as a feature template in the database of the biometric system. The reliability and accuracy of the biometric systems are improved by using multiple modalities, sensors or algorithms during recognition process. These systems are called as Multibiomtric systems which results into greater accuracy but with increased cost and complexity. In comparison to unibiometric system, a multi-modal system provides better recognition performance and protection from spoof attacks. Biometric systems are generally used in modern day computing to provide security during authentication in many applications but these systems themselves are vulnerable to various types of attacks. In this paper, an analysis of various security issues and template security schemes for Biometric Systems is presented. One of the challenges is to protect user's raw image data from imposters as well as to secure template data. It is found that template data security is a major design issue and needs to be addressed by designing low overhead security schemes. Template security schemes are dependent on the overall performance parameters of the system and must be computationally hard to avoid modality reconstruction.","","978-1-4673-8253-3","10.1109/RAECS.2015.7453302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7453302","Biometric systems;Feature Template;Template security;privacy protection;Multimodal biometrics;Feature fusion","Databases;Fingerprint recognition;Feature extraction;Cryptography;Sensors","data protection;feature extraction;object recognition;security of data;visual databases","performance analysis;template data security;template data protection;biometric system database;human identification;human verification;biological traits;behavioural traits;feature template;recognition process;multibiomtric systems;unibiometric system;multimodal system;spoof attacks;security issues;template security schemes;user raw image data protection","","6","","21","IEEE","19 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Extreme learning machine (ELM) offers prediction results comparable to other state-of-art learning methods and has much quicker learning curve. WSCC 3-machine 9-bus system and IEEE 39-bus New England test power system are considered to demonstrate the superiority of ELM as a predictive model.

The error in the input data may result in a misleading index which either increases system operating costs or jeopardizes service continuity. This paper aims at establishing an step-by-step algorithm to study impacts of error in measurements on system security indices. Two different security indices representing under voltage severity and over load severity are studied in this paper. The proposed algorithm has three major steps. In the first step, typical measurements are sampled according to the system operating state and randomly generated errors. This is done using Monte Carlo sampling approach. The second step is to extract an approximate model of the system true state which is done via state estimators. Then, security indices are calculated for both the approximated and true states in the third step. Comparison between the indices demonstrates impacts of the erroneous measurements on security assessment.","2164-7054","978-1-4799-1972-7","10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7146480","Erroneous measurement;Monte Carlo simulation;security analysis;state estimation","Decision support systems;Electrical engineering;Conferences","measurement errors;Monte Carlo methods;power system security","security assessment;Monte Carlo sampling approach;randomly generated errors;over load severity;voltage severity;power system real-time security analysis;erroneous measurements","","3","","11","IEEE","2 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Storing data and performing computations using for example cloud services is commonplace nowadays. However, the information security in network-based computation rarely is satisfactory. One technique to improve information security for networked computations is based on secure multiparty computations. The idea of multiparty computation originates from Yao, who considered the secure computation with two parties by introducing the technique called garbled circuits. The technique was then generalized, but still the exact definitions for different security measures were not established until Bellare, Hoang and Rogaway proposed a definition of a garbling scheme and several security notions for garbling schemes. This gave inspiration to study the security properties of garbling schemes from different perspectives, including adaptivity and reusability. In this paper, we study the adaptive security for a certain type of reusable garbling schemes. First, we consider general constraints to achieve security for this specific type of garbling schemes. Then we analyze the adaptive security classes of reusable garbling schemes. More specifically, we prove a relation between security classes that has been left open in earlier research.","","978-1-4799-6239-6","10.1109/CIT.2014.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984672","secure multiparty computations;garbling schemes;reusability;adaptive security;projectivity","Games;Medical diagnostic imaging;Software;Encryption;Adaptation models;Privacy","computer network security","reusable projective garbling scheme;network-based computation;data storage;cloud service;information security;networked computation;secure multiparty computation;garbled circuits;security measures;security properties;adaptive security","","1","","24","IEEE","15 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a newly designed framework for Modular Addition over field GF(2) satisfying the algebraic properties of regular Modular Addition 2n albeit with cumulative security enhancements and increased complexity to address these challenges. Nevertheless, it has been observed that the complexity of Modular Addition can be drastically decreased with the appropriate formulation of polynomial equations and probabilistic conditions. In this article we propose a new extended design framework for advanced Modular Addition and it is characterized by user-specified extendable security which does not impose additional changes in existing layout of ciphers including both stream and block ciphers. This framework can be rapidly scaled to use-specific requirements which boosts the algebraic degree of the overall structure. This, in turn it thwarts the probabilistic conditions by retaining the original hardware complexity sans critical modifications of Modular Addition 2n.","","978-1-908320-73-5","10.1109/ICITST.2016.7856683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7856683","Algebraic Cryptanalysis;Addition Modulo;Algebraic Degree;Scalability;SNOW2.0;TRIVIUM;S-Box;IDEA;AES;LFSR;NFSR;SAT solver;Stream Cipher;Block Cipher","Ciphers;Complexity theory;Mathematical model;Internet;Input variables","computational complexity;cryptography;formal logic;polynomials;probability","adaptive security framework;extensible computational complexity;cipher systems;algebraic cryptanalysis;algebraic tools;cryptosystems;modular addition;logic exclusive-OR;security threats;polynomial equations;probabilistic conditions;hardware complexity","","1","","15","","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To ensure the system stability and minimize potential economic losses, it is imperative to monitor operating states and detect attacks at the early stage. To meet this demand, Micro-Phasor Measurement Units (μPMU) are increasingly popular in monitoring distribution networks. However, due to the relatively low sampling rate, μPMU has not yet been used to detect and classify cyber-attacks in power electronics enabled smart grid. To our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to use μPMU to detect cyber attacks that degrade the performance of power electronics systems.

A joint reserve scheduling model considering the cross-sectorial impacts of operation uncertainties is essential but still insufficient to guarantee the reliable operation of the integrated electricity and natural gas system (IEGS). Therefore, this paper proposes a day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model for the IEGS to schedule the operation and reserve si-multaneously considering reliability requirements. Firstly, the multi-state models for generating units and gas wells are established. Based on the multi-state models, the expected unserved energy cost (EUEC) and the expected wind curtailment cost (EWC) criteria are proposed based on probabilistic methods considering wind fluctuation and random failures of components in IEGS. Furthermore, the EUEC and EWC criteria are incorporated into the day-ahead SCUC model, which is noncon-vex and mathematically reformulated into a solvable mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) problem. The proposed model is validated using an IEEE 30-bus system and Belgium 20-node natural gas system. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively schedule the energy reserve to guarantee the reliable operation of the IEGS considering the multiple uncertainties in different subsystems and the cross-sectorial failure propagation.","2196-5420","","10.35833/MPCE.2021.000028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584449","Integrated electricity and natural gas system (IEGS);natural gas reserve;electric reserve;expected unserved energy cost;expected wind curtailment;multi-state model;operational reliability","Reliability;Power system reliability;Natural gas;Uncertainty;Wind power generation;Probabilistic logic;Modeling","concave programming;demand side management;integer programming;natural gas technology;power generation dispatch;power generation reliability;power generation scheduling;probability;thermal power stations","Belgium 20-node natural gas system;cross-sectorial failure propagation;cross-sectorial impacts;day-ahead SCUC model;day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment model;EUEC criteria;EWC criteria;expected unserved energy cost criteria;expected wind curtailment cost criteria;gas well systems;IEEE 30-bus system;IEGS;integrated electricity and natural gas system;joint reserve scheduling model;MISOCP problem;mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem;multistate models;optimal energy reserve scheduling;reliability requirements;wind fluctuation","","","","31","","22 Oct 2021","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

For these applications, security procedures are often omitted in the interest of performance. Since this may not be acceptable when using public communications media, our research makes explicit and then utilizes the inherent tradeoffs in realizing performance vs. security in communications. Toward this end, we expand the notion of QoS to include the level of security that can be offered within performance and CPU resource availability constraints. To address performance and security tradeoffs in asymmetric and dynamic client-server environments, we developed Authenticast, a dynamically configurable user-level communication protocol offering variable levels of security throughout the execution. Authenticast comprises multiple heuristics to realize dynamic security levels and to decide when and how to apply dynamic security. To demonstrate this protocol, we have implemented a prototype of a high-performance privacy system. This prototype offers a novel security control abstraction with which tradeoffs in security vs. performance may be made explicit and then utilized with dynamic client-server asymmetries. Authenticast uses the ""security thermostat"" to enable adaptive security processing. The results demonstrate increased scalability and improved performance when adaptive security is applied to the client-server platform with varying numbers of clients and varying resource availabilities at clients.","","0-7803-4482-0","10.1109/IWQOS.1998.675229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=675229","","Authentication;Communication system security;Information security;Availability;Protocols;Prototypes;Protection;Computer applications;Computer networks;Privacy","computer network management;message authentication;client-server systems;performance evaluation;electronic data interchange;telecommunication services;data privacy","dynamic authentication;high-performance networked computing applications;information exchange;information integrity;information protection;security procedures;public communications media;tradeoffs;service quality;CPU resource availability constraints;asymmetric dynamic client-server environments;Authenticast;dynamically configurable user-level communication protocol;multiple heuristics;dynamic security levels;high-performance privacy system;security control abstraction;security thermostat;adaptive security processing;scalability;resource availability","","19","14","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve a sufficient accuracy, this assessment must take into account multi-state components such as generating units with derated states, multiple transmission lines with common-mode outages and the uncertainty on the load forecast. To achieve the speed required for online use, the method relies on the State Space Partitioning (SSP) technique, which divides the system state space into two subspaces. The system states with a large probability of occurrence comprise the first subspace and are identified using the Fast Sorting Technique (FST). System states that have a low probability of occurrence but which could have severe consequences are sampled using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) over the residual subspace.

A new integrity computational algorithm and encryption technique are implemented to provide the strong data integrity verification and data security in distributed applications.

A control scheme called as hierarchical hybrid control is proposed versus the hierarchical structure and hybrid dynamics of large power systems. A novel hybrid model is first founded to clearly explain the interactive hybrid behaviors of the power systems during significant disturbances. On the basis of the model, the hybrid control is proposed, which consists of upper level control strategies (including logic control commands for discrete events and energy management strategies) and lower level continuous controls for component units. The upper level control strategies are responsible for switching operating modes for the purpose of security operation following a significant disturbance, as well as power assignment for the economical efficiency of operation, and the lower level continuous controllers are responsible for regulating dynamic stability of the systems. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid control is demonstrated through simulation examples.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2012.2225046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6387633","Continuous controllers;energy management;hybrid control;logic control strategies;smart gird","Power system stability;Smart grids;Power system dynamics;Energy management","continuous systems;discrete event systems;energy management systems;hierarchical systems;power system control;power system economics;power system security;power system stability","two-level hierarchical hybrid control;smart power system;large power systems;security problems;stability problems;economical efficiency problems;component units;upper level control strategies;lower level continuous controllers;logic control commands;discrete event system;energy management strategies","","6","","24","IEEE","19 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is well known that induction motor loads have a particularly hazardous role in the voltage stability. On the other hand, in transmission systems loaded by induction motor loads, configuration changes such as line tripping, may cause voltage collapse. Moreover, if there is a fault on transmission lines, the disturbance effect will then significantly increase the possibility of voltage collapse. In this study, a transmission system subjected to different faults on different locations is examined from the viewpoint of voltage stability. The study shows that in the certain cases of paralleled transmission lines, single or double phase tripping of a faulted line will have positive effects on voltage stability, instead of all three phase tripping.","","0-7803-5836-8","10.1109/PTC.1999.826511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=826511","","Transmission lines;Voltage;Circuit faults;Power system stability;Power transmission lines;Power system dynamics;Induction motors;Power system modeling;Reactive power;Power system faults","power transmission control;power transmission faults;power transmission lines;power system dynamic stability;control system analysis;induction motors;load (electric);power system security","transmission line faults;dynamic voltage stability;power systems;induction motor loads;transmission systems;line tripping;voltage collapse;transmission lines faults;paralleled transmission lines;single-phase tripping;double-phase tripping","","2","","2","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, we present B++, a scalable blockchain structure, which breaks the limits of blockchain security so that B++ can distribute system resources efficiently to confirm transactions with different requirements. In our analysis, we show that B++ inherits eventual consistency in Bitcoin-like protocols.

The aim is to alleviate the current in overloaded transmission lines before the local overload protection acts, since it might initiate a cascading event that would eventually drive the system to a blackout. The proposal is structured to act in coordination with the traditional underfrequency and undervoltage load shedding. For this purpose, PMU measurements of voltage phasors and frequency are used for evaluating the event evolution in order to determine the adequate amount of load to be shed due to overload problems. The scheme also determines the location of the load to be shed by analyzing the participation of each load in the overloaded line via the computation of electrical distances between the overloaded-line receiving-end bus and the load bus. The proposal is tested on the IEEE New England 39-bus test system.

However, when the Stuxnet attack is launched, the attack signals with random multitude and frequency will be injected to trigger more hazard modes, and finally, hasten fatigue of control devices. Under this unpredictable attack, the transition between operating modes will not follow the regular transition probabilities. Therefore, a hidden Markov model with time-varying transition probabilities is utilized to describe the Stuxnet attack. The transition probabilities are estimated based on the measurements. By recognizing operating modes and predicting the number of the occurrence of hazard modes, the Stuxnet attack can be detected earlier if the predicted value exceeds the threshold.

In this paper, a transfer learning method is proposed to detect cyber-attacks in photovoltaic (PV) systems with much less training data. First of all, two PV systems with a different number of PV inverters and power ratings are analyzed and their attack models are studied. Next, an attack detection Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was trained with rich amount of data from PV #1. Then, transfer learning was proposed to transfer the well-trained features from PV #1 to PV #2. Lastly, the attack detection model on PV #2 was trained based on the transferred CNN model. The experiment results show that the proposed transfer learning method achieves better accuracy and a faster convergence rate with a much less training dataset than conventional deep learning.","2470-6647","978-1-6654-0688-8","10.1109/APEC43599.2022.9773401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773401","transfer learning;PV farm;cyber-attack;attack detection","Training;Photovoltaic systems;Biological system modeling;Transfer learning;Training data;Power system stability;Data models","convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;power system measurement;security of data","attack detection convolutional neural network model;CNN model;power ratings;PV inverters;PV systems;system stability;power systems;transfer learning;photovoltaic systems;data-driven cyberattack detection","","","","14","IEEE","19 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Threat modeling allows for a by-design approach, mitigating problems before they arise and avoiding later costly development efforts. However, it mainly pays off in software construction approaches that rely on planned architectures, in which sources of threats can be anticipated beforehand. These axiomatic assumptions are, however, increasingly untrue in contemporary software development practices in which software systems evolve drastically in later stages. In addition, software-intensive systems are increasingly faced with uncertainty in their operational contexts, and these are nearly impossible to enumerate in early development stages. In this article, we first present the idea of reflective threat modeling, which involves the automated derivation of architectural system models from run-time and operational system artifacts, providing the threat modeler with an accurate and workable run-time inspection view of the system. We then outline and motivate the potential of adopting threat analysis models as a basis for holistic and adaptive threat management through integration of adaptive security and privacy technologies.

Distinct from the previous approaches in this field, our scheme not only efficiently realizes access control over encrypted data in a fine-grained and revocable way but also is proved to be adaptively secure under standard decision linear assumption. Meanwhile, the parameters do not need to be predefined in the system initialization and thus, our scheme satisfies the unbounded property. Moreover, the monotonic span program (MSP) is elegantly utilized as the access structure to reduce the number of bilinear pairing and exponentiation operations for encryption and decryption.

The IEEE 34 Node Test Feeder used and extended by addition of photovoltaic, wind, and energy storage DERs. Consumer loads and DER's generation were extended from static values to typical load and generation profiles, which examined daily, weekly, and seasonal patterns. Protection device settings were calculated selectively in the absence of DERs. Using the method of Protection Security Assessment (PSA), automatically evaluate the correct operation of protection devices in case of different fault scenarios. Three-phase and single-phase metallic faults are applied to validate protection system security. The PSA reassessed DER contribution and influence on protection selectivity. Adaptive rules should fix identified miss-coordinations by modifying protection settings or feeder automation logic. This paper applied adaptive rules to improve protection settings.

Liu et al. recently proposed a new stealthy false data injection attack, which can bypass the existing bad data detection schemes and arbitrarily manipulate the states of power system, posing dangerous threats to the control of a power system. Nevertheless, their results did not show the detailed information of meters to be compromised. In this paper, we tend to tackle this issue and develop mechanisms to efficiently compute the optimal set of meter measurements given a number of state variables to be manipulated in a power-grid network.

On the other hand, it also makes the power system more vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. One attack that has serious consequences is the False Data Injection (FDI) attack against the state estimation process. Although some techniques have been proposed to select meters to protect, none of them considers the cost of protecting meters, and thus will not perform well when only a limited number of meters can be protected due to budget limitation. In this paper, we consider a new problem: Given a limited budget, how to select the most critical meters to protect so that the probability of attackers launching successful stealthy FDI attack is minimized? We first formalize this problem which is NP-complete, and then propose heuristic based solutions. The idea is to rank and select meters based on a metric called vulnerability index, which considers two factors: how likely the meter will be targeted by the attacker to launch FDI attacks and how much damage will be caused by compromising the meter in case of a successful stealthy FDI attack. Evaluation results show that our algorithm can significantly reduce the probability of successful attacks, as well as the potential damage caused by FDI attacks.","","978-1-5386-4586-4","10.1109/CNS.2018.8433215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8433215","","Meters;State estimation;Voltage measurement;Monitoring;Security;Smart grids","computational complexity;power engineering computing;power system security;probability;SCADA systems;security of data;smart power grids;state estimation","protecting meters;critical meters;successful stealthy FDI attack;FDI attacks;successful attacks;smart grid;enhanced capabilities;SCADA system;power system;operating states;state estimation process;mitigating stealthy false data injection attacks;false data injection attack","","3","","25","IEEE","13 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For real-time voltage/reactive power control, a suboptimal power flow procedure has been derived by using a reduced set of control variables. This procedure is based on sensitivity theory applied to the determination of zones for the secondary voltage/reactive power control and the corresponding reduced set of regulating sources, whose reactive outputs represent control variables in the optimal power flow program.

Temporal diversity can be achieved by making periodic configuration changes; however in an infrastructure of multiple similarly purposed computers diversity must also be spatial, ensuring multiple computers do not simultaneously share the same configuration and potential vulnerabilities. Given the number of possible changes and their potential interdependencies discovering computer configurations that are secure, functional, and diverse is challenging. This paper describes how a Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be employed to find temporally and spatially diverse secure computer configurations. In the proposed approach a computer configuration is modeled as a chromosome, where an individual configuration setting is a trait or allele. The GA operates by combining multiple chromosomes (configurations) which are tested for feasibility and ranked based on performance which will be measured as resistance to attack. Successive iterations of the GA yield configurations that are often more secure and diverse due to the crossover and mutation processes. Simulations results will demonstrate this approach can provide at MT environment for a large infrastructure of similarly purposed computers by discovering temporally and spatially diverse secure configurations.","","978-1-4673-0402-3","10.1109/SafeConfig.2011.6111663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6111663","","Computers;Biological cells;Security;Genetic algorithms;Computational modeling;Hamming distance;Diversity reception","configuration management;genetic algorithms;security of data","moving target environment;genetic algorithms;computer systems;security;temporal diversity;periodic configuration changes;secure computer configurations","","16","1","12","IEEE","26 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking thunderstorm as an example, this paper analyzes the mechanisms of natural disasters affecting power systems. The required data are discussed and an early-warning method is proposed based on data provided by a lighting location system. Firstly according to the proposed criteria, the thunder locations detected within the current interval are grouped into areas; secondly the results are matched with those of the previous interval; finally the most possible thunder areas can be estimated for the next several intervals. Unlike traditional models with annual average probability of thunder-striking faults, the proposed real-time probability model which considers real-time information is space dependent, as well as time dependent. Instead of being fixed, the list of preassigned faults to be on-line assessed is time varying.

Moreover, transmit power control is employed to enhance the rate of packet reception of the legitimate receiver.

Users obtain a clean, consistent, current build each time they log in, removing the nuisance of security patching and rebooting for environmental changes. Local execution and caching preserves user experience comparable to traditionally installed applications. To explore feasibility, Intel conducted a proof-of-concept (POC) to evaluate streaming in its call center and manufacturing environments on multi-user systems. The four-part study included performance, usability, IT operations and total cost of ownership (TCO). The proof-of-concept was successful in identifying streaming as a feasible technology with good performance and positive TCO in the tested scenarios. The biggest benefits were related to locking down the client and thus eliminating service calls related to configuration changes, software installation and viruses. The major challenges encountered were around the high learning curve and the software maturity related to packing applications for streaming.

Several suggested approaches for real-time stability assessment require Thevenin impedances to be determined for the observed system conditions. By combining matrix factorization, graph reduction, and parallelization, an algorithm for computing Thevenin impedances an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches is developed.

It allows us to auto control electronic appliances in the house such as fans, lights, gates, doors, windows, and many more including security access systems and alarm systems. In this paper, we have implemented the operation of lights through the voice-controlled home automation system by giving voice commands as an input to the system for the user to turn ON and turn OFF the lights at home. The system mainly uses the Raspberry Pi module, which happens to be an important component of our smart light system implementation. It consists of both hardware and software components, which have a speech recognition module implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has voice commands that can be understood, and accordingly, lights can be operated with its usage. It has a special feature that when the light gets turned ON or OFF, it will be ensured to the user through an audio output by the speaker. The main working of a voice-automated system depends on the recognition of the voice given by the user as an input. Raspberry Pi module keeps all electrical home appliances connected through a single interface for complete smart home system automation. Today's modern world is shifting from conventional switches to centralized control systems with less human intervention, as result, the use of manual operating switches is slowly deteriorating. In this paper, we have used voice recognition for operating the home appliances where there is no need to use the conventional switches, and hence human effort required for the system is comparatively very less. Research work on smart home systems mainly aims to satisfy the needs, which help elderly and disabled people etc. in operating home appliances without any helping support from others.

Given the growing scale of cyber systems, this task must be highly automated. Unfortunately, prior work on configuration errors has largely ignored the security impact of configurations of connected components. To address this gap, we present SCIBORG, a framework that improves the security posture of distributed systems by examining the impact of configuration changes across interdependent components using a graph-based model of the system and its vulnerabilities. It formulates a Constraint Satisfaction Problem from the graph-based model and uses an SMT solver to find optimal configuration parameter values that minimize the impact of attacks while preserving system functionality. SCIBORG also provides supporting evidence for the proposed configuration changes.

The goal is to reduce the latency of emergency services for vehicles such as ambulances and police cars, with minimum unnecessary disruption to the regular traffic, and preventing potential misuses. To this end, we propose to design a framework in which the Traffic Management System (TMS) may adapt by dynamically adjusting traffic lights, changing related driving policies, recommending behavior change to drivers, and applying essential security controls. The choice of an adaptation depends on the emergency severity level announced by the emergency vehicle(s).

Therefore, initial projects looking at this concept have focussed on the technology for providing multi-mode and software reconfigurable terminals. The Transparently Reconfigurable Ubiquitous Terminal (TRUST) project differs in that it examines the user requirements in order to identify the frameworks and systems that are needed to support software reconfigurable radios from the users' perspective. The primary goal of the TRUST project is to realise the user potential of reconfigurable radio systems, which will provide network connectivity and services when and where they are required. The project will achieve this through a four-step process: (1) understand the users' requirements from their perspective of the system: ""the terminal"" (2) translate these users' requirements into technology requirements (3) advance the terminal and network technologies through research and innovation (4) validate, promote and disseminate these advancements and technologies.","","0-7803-6463-5","10.1109/PIMRC.2000.881582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=881582","","Software radio;Security;Application software;Software standards;FCC;Europe;Laboratories;Educational institutions;Software testing;Economies of scale","land mobile radio;telecommunication terminals;data communication","IST-TRUST;reconfiguration;future mobile terminals;software download;reconfigurable software radio;Transparently Reconfigurable Ubiquitous Terminal;user requirements;software reconfigurable radios;user potential;network connectivity","","14","9","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we analyze the impact of image scaling on the image processing algorithms, with focus on object detection. Different methods for image scaling are presented and their impact on the algorithms are measured. We propose an adaptive scaling mechanism, that implies the selection and dynamic adaptive configuration of one of the available hardware engines (interpolators), in order to optimize the power consumption and the bandwidth used for data transmission. The artificial intelligence processing outputs are used as a source for these configuration changes. Besides the optimal decision on enabling the appropriate re-sampling interpolator, the parameters computed (in order to configure this selected hardware block) are the quality of the scaling and the image resolution. The hardware implementation for this mechanism is presented and the measured results are discussed.

Occasional incidents may cause overload problems, voltage problems, and cascading failures. These problems may damage the system stability. Therefore, in the normal state of the system, it is important to study the state transition and its harm to the system through security analysis. Besides, adopting certain control measures to reduce the risk of the system, such as the coordination of prevention and emergency control, is of great significance to both the safety and the economy of the system. In this premise, this paper proposes a risk-based two-layer optimization model for coordination on prevention control and emergency control of quasi-steady state AC-DC system. By introducing a continuous derivable function, the non-derivable constraints in the traditional model are replaced by continuous derivable constraints. The method can greatly improve the computational efficiency of the model. According to the characteristic of the two-layer optimization model, the first layer optimization problem is solved by the golden section method, and the second layer optimization problem is solved by the active and reactive power alternating approach method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with simulation example.","","978-1-5386-5392-0","10.1109/CIEEC.2018.8745954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8745954","AC-DC system;risk;coordination control;active and reactive power alternating approach method","Power system stability;Mathematical model;Optimization;Stability analysis;Power conversion;Reactive power","AC-DC power convertors;hybrid power systems;optimisation;power system control;power system security;power system stability;reactive power;risk analysis","risk-based two-layer optimization model;quasisteady state AC-DC hybrid system;cascading failures;voltage problems;overload problems;security analysis;continuous derivable function;golden section method;active and reactive power alternating approach method;system stability;emergency control;prevention control;risk-based coordination research","","","","15","IEEE","27 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This arrangement of measures was able to restore the grid to a secure operating state, even with the five lines still out of service. The simulation studies show the effectiveness of a protection arrangement, functioning during the first postdisturbance period, with well-timed measures concentrated only in the region most affected by the disturbance.

The two existing proposals to date are ART (Cohn-Gordon et al., CCS18) and TreeKEM (IETF, The Messaging Layer Security Protocol, draft). TreeKEM is the currently considered candidate by the IETF MLS working group, but dynamic group operations (i.e. adding and removing users) can cause efficiency issues. In this paper we formalize and analyze a variant of TreeKEM which we term Tainted TreeKEM (TTKEM for short). The basic idea underlying TTKEM was suggested by Millican (MLS mailing list, February 2018). This version is more efficient than TreeKEM for some natural distributions of group operations, we quantify this through simulations.Our second contribution is two security proofs for TTKEM which establish post compromise and forward secrecy even against adaptive attackers. The security loss (to the underlying PKE) in the Random Oracle Model is a polynomial factor, and a quasipolynomial one in the Standard Model. Our proofs can be adapted to TreeKEM as well. Before our work no security proof for any TreeKEM-like protocol establishing tight security against an adversary who can adaptively choose the sequence of operations was known. We also are the first to prove (or even formalize) active security where the server can arbitrarily deviate from the protocol specification. Proving fully active security – where also the users can arbitrarily deviate – remains open.","2375-1207","978-1-7281-8934-5","10.1109/SP40001.2021.00035","European Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9519462","secure-group-messaging;adaptive-security;message-layer-security","Adaptation models;Privacy;Protocols;Subspace constraints;Security;Servers;Proposals","cryptographic protocols;message authentication;polynomials;public key cryptography","Tainted TreeKEM;secure continuous group key agreement;strong security guarantees;similar security guarantees;Messaging Layer Security Protocol;IETF MLS working group;dynamic group operations;TTKEM;security proof;security loss;TreeKEM-like;tight security;proving fully active security","","2","","25","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Probe data from mobile phones provides an important data source for collecting system performance data that can be used as feedback to improve the management of the various transportation and queuing systems used by airport travelers. This paper reports on a study using Bluetooth sensors to quantitatively evaluate the operations of airport security checkpoints. Bluetooth sensors were deployed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport from 30 August to 13 September, 2010 and collected over 100,000 travel time records between data collection stations located along access roads, parking garages, non-sterile areas of terminals, and sterile areas of terminals. In addition, hourly checkpoint passenger volumes were collected. The large volume of this data necessitated the development of statistical characterization procedures and graphics that characterize both the travel time records and checkpoint information. These checkpoint operations reports provide dashboard level reports useful for management to rapidly assess operations, and identify opportunities for improved allocation of staffing. The paper concludes by providing examples of how the checkpoint operations report concept can be extended to characterize the movement of traffic through the airport, the entire passenger arrival experience, and numerically characterize user delay in person-hours. A final overview procedure using pareto sorting to identify correctable periods where airports have opportunity to improve their utilization is shown.","2153-0017","978-1-4799-2914-6","10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6728411","","Airports;Security;Delays;Bars","airports;Bluetooth;data analysis;pedestrians;security","multimodal airport land side probe data;Bluetooth enabled mobile devices;data analysis;data collection;Bluetooth sensors;airport security checkpoint operations;George Bush Intercontinental Airport;hourly checkpoint passenger volumes;dashboard level reports;travel time records;checkpoint information","","3","","12","IEEE","30 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main objective of this study is to design and implement an enhanced algorithm combining the functionalities of standard SNOW-3G and ZUC algorithms in order to provide security to the LTE network. A chaotic generator has been used to increase the randomness and robustness of generated key-streams. The proposed architecture was implemented on Xilinx virtex-S FPGA technology and its security was evaluated using many security tests (generated key-stream distribution, key sensitivity, key space, and NIST statistical tests). The experimental results show that the proposed design allows to encrypt data in two operating modes (SNOW-3G and ZUC modes) using limited hardware resources and power consumption while ensuring more resistance against cryptanalysis attacks.","","978-1-5386-4683-0","10.1109/CyberSecPODS.2018.8560677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560677","SNOW-3G stream cipher;ZUC stream cipher;Robustness;Mobile security;Chaotic generator;NIST statistical analysis;Key sensitivity;Key space;Cryptanalysis;FPGA implementation","","3G mobile communication;chaotic communication;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;Long Term Evolution;statistical testing;telecommunication security","chaotic system;stream ciphers;3GPP organization;3rd Generation Partnership Project;enhanced algorithm;standard SNOW-3G;LTE network;chaotic generator;security tests;key sensitivity;key space;Xilinx Virtex-S FPGA technology;robust SNOW-ZUC algorithm;combined SNOW-ZUC algorithm;Long Term Evolution;LTE network security;generated key-stream distribution;NIST statistical tests;data enryption;hardware resources;cryptanalysis attacks;radio network security","","3","","28","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Solutions for enabling information security in BANs require extensive use of cryptographic primitives that involve considerable performance overhead. Consequently, information security is typically not available in wearable technologies. We need adaptive security solutions that increase the level of security in the event of threats but otherwise impose minimal security overhead in order for them to viable for BANs. The first step in building adaptive security for BANs is to detect the threats. In this paper we propose a solution for detecting adversaries attacking the communication channel of a BAN called a wearable honeypot system. It works by communicating fake user health information between the base station and a set of designated decoy nodes in the BAN. Any alteration of this traffic, in content or arrival time, is considered adversarial tampering. A preliminary implementation of this wearable honeypot system demonstrates that it is effective in detecting a variety of communication attacks on a BAN.","","978-1-5090-1540-5","10.1109/SARNOF.2016.7846755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7846755","","Base stations;Accelerometers;Security;Biomedical monitoring;Communication channels;Peer-to-peer computing;Monitoring","body area networks;telecommunication security","adversarial tampering;wearable honeypot system;information security;body area network;wearable networks","","","","8","IEEE","9 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accordingly, a high throughput, low latency Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure should be opted in this regard.

Yet, the efficiency of a WSN depends a lot on the network design and the routing technique. In this paper a new design of the ICT network for smart grid using WSN is proposed. In order to understand the interactions between different entities, detect their operational levels, design the routing scheme and identify false data injection by particular ICT entities, a new model of interdependency called the Multi State Implicative Interdependency Model (MSIIM) is proposed in this paper, which is an updated version of the Modified Implicative Interdependency Model (MIIM) [1]. MSIIM considers the data dependency and operational accuracy of entities together with structural and functional dependencies between them. A multi-path secure routing technique is also proposed in this paper which relies on the MSIIM model for its functioning.

Therefore, healthcare service providers must implement efficient security mechanisms carefully while taking the advantages of connected devices without compromising the patient safety and disturbing the real-time health services. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a real-time counterpart of a physical world. DT offers significant advantages to cybersecurity experts, empowering them to predict risks without entering the physical world, and to simulate and test cyber-attacks that would otherwise be infeasible to do in real-time in the physical environment. DT in healthcare helps to identify security vulnerabilities, conduct attack simulations, and potential security breaches by creating a virtual replica of the targeted healthcare systems. In this paper, a novel and automated conceptual framework is developed for reinforcing the cybersecurity in IoT-based healthcare using DT technology.

Achieving these goals would require software development, management, and operation platforms that support elasticity, diversity, awareness, cooperation, and intelligence. In this paper, we propose CyberX, a situation-aware trustworthy management platform. CyberX utilizes our Cell Oriented Architecture (COA) capability that separates the main design concerns: data, logic and physical resources to employ runtime diversity via hot shuffling of similar-function different-quality-objective code variants. CyberX employs such diversity to modify the application implicit behavior at runtime utilizing autonomous execution elasticity and adaptability. Further, CyberX enhances application resilience against failures and attacks via multi-mode recovery and real-time, context- and situation-aware adjustment of shuffling and recovery policies.

It is dynamic, virtualized, scalable and pay per use model over internet. In a cloud computing environment, a cloud service provider offers “house of resources” includes applications, data, runtime, middleware, operating system, virtualization, servers, data storage and sharing and networking and tries to take up most of the overhead of client. Cloud computing offers lots of benefits, but the journey of the cloud is not very easy. It has several pitfalls along the road because most of the services are outsourced to third parties with added enough level of risk. Cloud computing is suffering from several issues and one of the most significant is Security, privacy, service availability, confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and compliance. Security is a shared responsibility of both client and service provider and we believe security must be information centric, adaptive, proactive and built in.

Also, for configuration interfaces to be remotely accessible, corporate networks need to be configured accordingly to provide access possibilities. Such additional access possibilities might then be used by adversaries when attacking corporate networks and thus, are often seen as a security weakness. If ICPS are not updated, outdated configurations also lead to security weaknesses.

Security of online e-commerce over the Internet is provided through Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS). The SSL/TLS uses public key cryptographic algorithms which are computational intensive due to the modular multiplications. Therefore, SSL/TLS servers often become overloaded while performing public key decryptions when the simultaneous requests increase rapidly. Overload can lead e-commerce applications to considerable revenue losses, response times may grow to unacceptable levels and as a result the server may saturate even crash. So load management of SSL/TLS web server is a critical issue in e-commerce. The proposed work in this paper is to manage load on the server by applying Adaptive SSL policy and session handling mechanism. This policy is self-adaptive security, which offers great potential in providing timely and fine grained security control on server, by runtime adaptation of cryptographic algorithm.

However, the increasing integration of the 6G network with the physical world leads to a plethora of new scenarios that bring new challenges to 6G, especially from the security and energy aspects. In 5G networks, security solutions across all devices and base stations are configured with universal settings for certain types of attacks. This one-size-fit-all strategy no longer suits 6G security due to the higher diversity in device capabilities, service features, energy conditions, attack vulnerabilities, and other time-varying attributes. Since each scenario may have unique security requirements and energy availability, the selection and configuration of security strategies need to be optimized for 6G networks in an adaptive and dynamic manner. In this article, we explore 6G security from an energy efficiency perspective by balancing the tradeoff between security and energy consumption in various scenarios. Specifically, we first investigate the AI-empowered 6G network architecture with promising applications and visions. Then we identify the challenges for adaptive and dynamic security optimization in 6G from the aspects of heterogeneity, dynamics, and modeling complexity. To balance security-energy trade-off, we propose an optimization framework that provides customized recommendations of security strategy to different user devices and base stations.

An active power system (APS) may have a great variety of diverse operating conditions that effectively prevent any visual recognition and manual control of its operating modes; besides, they require automatic real-time process control.

Active power systems are more demanding with respect to electric power quality and measurement accuracy. Calculations herein show the need to lower the allowable margin of voltage and current error in PMUs, as the existing requirements are not consistent with the functioning of active power systems.

Approaches based on manually written rules are often fragile and require constant maintenance in this era of continuous integration. In this paper, we propose a novel “discovery by example” approach to autonomously search for and identify system changes. Our approach learns characteristic features of system changes automatically, without requiring any explicit rule definitions or specific knowledge of the underlying software or systems. In this approach, given a system change, our method searches a repository that contains previous stored system changes and returns those that are similar to it. We further explore the use of various forms of “fingerprints” to represent system changes efficiently and faithfully in a compact manner. We propose and evaluate two types of fingerprints: the “basename fingerprint” and the “1-D histogram fingerprint”. We show that both fingerprints exhibit different efficiency and accuracy trade-offs, and they can be effectively employed in different use cases.

Recently, In-band Network Telemetry (INT) has presented its unique capabilities in acquiring the insights of a network and thus has been adopted in many production networks. However, less attention was put on the potential threats on INT (e.g., the man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojan horse injection) that may falsify network measurements resulting in catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose a secure INT architecture called SINT that can effectively mitigate INT vulnerabilities and can be implemented using ‘chiplet’ based multi-modal network processors (MNP). SINT adopts blockchain technology into INT, in which a network status snapshot acquired via INT is viewed as a block and added into a network telemetry blockchain to prevent arbitrary access and malicious modification. To minimize the intrusiveness of the INT and blockchain operations, SINT is designed to be a lightweight protocol and uses improved RAFT consensus mechanisms to reduce its network and computing overhead. The design of the chiplet MNP system makes SINT highly flexible and adaptive to facilitate INT convergence and related blockchain updates. In the SINT architecture, INT tasks and blockchain operations are dispatched to different chips to achieve an optimal trade-off among measurement accuracy, security requirements, and computing resource on the data plane. Experiments and simulations show that SINT can alleviate most cyberattacks on INT and retain 97% of bandwidth utilization for other users’ normal traffic in a complex scenario with 500 nodes. Furthermore, SINT converges the INT results quickly and accurately with minor overhead compared to that of the state-of-art INT methods.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2023.3269891","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1800602); China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022M710677); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10107633","INT;blockchain;multi-modal network processor;security","Blockchains;Telemetry;Computer architecture;Security;Current measurement;Control systems;Task analysis","blockchains;computer network security;invasive software;security of data;telemetry","blockchain operations;blockchain technology;blockchain-based;chiplet based multimodal network processors;In-Band Network Telemetry Architecture;INT convergence;INT results;INT tasks;INT vulnerabilities;managed network;network management;network measurements;network status snapshot;network telemetry blockchain;production networks;related blockchain updates;secure INT architecture;SINT architecture;state-of-art INT methods","","","","50","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Basing on this, we can alarm and prevent the outage to assure the safety and reliability of the power system. Traditional reliability is an expected value of long-term reliability level under the fixed operating mode, which cannot reflect the real time reliability level under the current operational state. This essay presents the novel conception and algorithm of online evaluating the short-term reliability in order to study the operational reliability level. The influence of the variable system states on the reliability level is reflected according to the real time operational information provided by the SCADA/EMS/WAMS. Markov process is adopted to solve the transient state probability of the components, so that forecasting the system state basing on the transient probability is possible. The probability of the system state and the reliability indices of the system changes as the time varying. The analysis and the assessment of IEEE RTS-79 system indicates that there are great differences between the short-term and long-term reliability indices, and only the transient probability evaluation can assess the short-term probability properly. In this paper the relationship between the enumerating number of the system states and the forecasting time is also studied. The result indicates that only a few system states are needed to get relative high degree of evaluation accuracy, which can be applied online.

This method is further implemented by FPGA hardware, such that the performances of real-time and security of the control network are both guaranteed.

In this manner, multi-modal biometric generates more interest than a single biometric identification system. Researchers are interested in multimodal biometric systems' certificates because, compared to those of a unimodal biometric system, they offer advantages like improved accuracy in recognition competence and dependable security. Here, a Hand vein and Iris based multimodal Fingerprint system is designed with Deep Learning. Encrypting the alignment maintaining characteristics, the hand vein based method aims to be more robustly tolerant of the possible fractures, rotating, and translational shifts. As a step towards Palm Vein Identification, a picture processing method is used to examine the vascular pattern of the hand palm vein. Iris biometrics were integrated into the authentication process to further strengthen its reliability. An infrared camera or scanner device is used to collect the palm vein pattern, and this data is then put through four distinct filters. Deep Bayesian Net was used for categorization in the suggested system.

Unimodal biometric systems are unable to handle situations including noisy data and non-universalities, inter-class variations, intra-class variations, and spoof attacks.

Current protocols and applications allow significant changes to a system to take place within a short time or small network footprint, which can be exploited by attackers to cause a great impact on the physical systems. This paper proposes adaptive Commensurate Response (CR) to narrow down the asymmetry between the cost of attacks and their impact through enforcing command footprints to be commensurate with their impact on the system. Such impact is measured by the change of the setpoint (change-driven CR) or the distance between the operating state and the critical state (criticality-driven CR). Change-driven CR is effective for setpoint attacks with big setpoint changes, and criticality-driven CR can be used to combat both setpoint attacks and actuation attacks. Our case study on automobile cruise control demonstrates that CR can effectively improve the system resilience and attack survivability while satisfying QoS requirements.","","978-1-5386-0683-4","10.1109/CNS.2017.8228641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8228641","Cyber-Physical Systems;SCADA;Commensurate Response;Industrial Control Systems;PLC","Security;Cruise control;Temperature measurement;Steady-state;Communication networks;Fault tolerance","cyber-physical systems;security of data","adaptive commensurate response;command footprints;setpoint attacks;actuation attacks;system resilience;attack survivability;power systems;medical systems;critical infrastructures;network footprint;attackers;cyber-physical systems;change-driven CR;criticality-driven CR;automobile cruise control;QoS requirements","","7","","37","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we develop a deep learning based methodology for detection, localization, and data recovery of FDIA on power systems in a coherent and holistic manner. However, the multi-modal probability distributions of both measurements and state variables in SE due to ever-changing operating points and structural/topological changes pose great challenges in detecting and localizing FDIA. To address this challenge, we first propose an enhanced attack model to launch massive FDIA on limited access points. Second, we train an auto-encoder (AE) with a Bayesian change verification (BCV) classifier using $N-1$ contingencies to detect FDIA with unseen $N-k$ operational topologies. Third, to avoid model collapse caused by multi-modal measurement distribution, an AE-based generative adversarial network (GAN) is derived to generate a diverse candidate set of normal measurement vectors with various operational topologies. Finally, we develop a pattern match algorithm to localize and recover the falsified measurements and state variables by comparing the falsified measurement vectors with the normal measurement vectors in the candidate set. Case studies with IEEE benchmark systems and a modified 415-bus China Southern Grid system are provided to validate the proposed methodology. It shows that the proposed methodology achieves an average 95% accuracy for detection, over 80% accuracy for localization of FDIA, and recovers the measurement and state variables close to their true values.","2196-5420","","10.35833/MPCE.2020.000686","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51767001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9527999","False data injection attack;auto-encoder;generative adversarial network;state estimation;cyber security","Power systems;Topology;Power grids;Transmission line measurements;Power measurement;Location awareness;Meters","Bayes methods;computer network security;cyber-physical systems;deep learning (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;power engineering computing;power grids;power system security;power system state estimation;statistical distributions","access points;AE-based generative adversarial network;auto-encoder;Bayesian change verification classifier;BCV;catastrophic consequences;cyber-attack;cyber-physical system operation;data recovery;deep learning based methodology;falsified measurement vectors;FDIA;GAN;IEEE benchmark systems;massive false data injection attack;modified 415-bus China Southern Grid system;multimodal measurement distribution;multimodal probability distributions;pattern match algorithm;power systems;sparse attack points;state estimation;state variables;uncertain topological changes","","","","35","","2 Sep 2021","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

OT networks have traditionally been isolated from IT networks, and therefore, security has been of minor concern. Given the trend toward interconnecting OT and IT networks for business reasons, and given the disclosure of highly sophisticated attacks against OT environments, OT network operators increasingly recognize the need to deploy security solutions that are widely known in IT also to OT. OT networks are running critical control processes. Configuration changes are avoided to reduce the risk of misconfiguration or unforeseeable side effects detrimental to the network's operation. Therefore, passive non-intrusive security technologies are favored. Consequently, security intelligence applied to passively collected network data is the most acceptable technology to be deployed in OT networks. In this paper, we show how IT-specific security intelligence techniques can be applied to passively collected OT network data. The techniques have been developed for protecting SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems and have been validated in an industrial cyber security testing laboratory.","0018-8646","","10.1147/JRD.2016.2575698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7523351","","Indutrial control systems;Process control;Integrated circuits;Computer security;Software testing;Monitoring","","","","5","","29","IBM","27 Jul 2016","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

Modern industrial processes leverage advanced IT technologies to increase productivity and often combine multiple system concepts such as Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and Cloud Computing. Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS) are key enablers of this revolution. In CPPS, raw materials, machines, and operations are interconnected to form a sophisticated network. Protecting them against advanced cyber-threats is a priority concern for the future implementation of Industry 4.0 applications. Any impairment of such systems can lead, in fact, to catastrophic damages resulting in a substantial financial loss for governments, companies, as well as endanger the safety of the society. The need for high availability and reliability of these systems is therefore the pillar guiding our research. This paper proposes the adoption of anomaly detection as a method to support self-adaptation in CPPS and to ensure flexibility, reliability, and protection of industrial environments against modern cyber threats. An anomaly detection mechanism can be employed to monitor, and learn the normal behavior of an industrial system, and to generate alerts when the observed events indicate abnormal activities. On this concept we base our work, and we demonstrate how timely identifying critical security events can enable, through the self-adaptation (e.g., triggering automatic configuration changes), an efficient protection of the CPPS against advanced threats, and an effective containment of their effects.","","978-1-5386-6531-2","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387655","Cyber Physical Production Systems;Self-adaptation;Anomaly Detection;Industry 4.0","Security;Monitoring;Anomaly detection;Measurement;Industries;Sensors;Planning","cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;security of data;self-adjusting systems","anomaly detection mechanism;productivity;IoT;Internet of Things;CPPS self-adaptation;Industry 4.0;cyber physical production systems protection;cloud computing;industrial processes;fourth industrial revolution;financial loss;cyber-threats","","18","","19","IEEE","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the statistical data, more than sixty percentages of the synchronous generator faults are the excitation system faults, which might cause loss of load, tie-line tripping, instability, collapse and etc. Therefore, it is crucial to identify loss of field as early as possible and take countermeasures. In loss of field protection, the impedance boundary criterion of steady state stability limit is widely used to distinguish loss of field and normal condition. However, the steady state stability limit circle is affected by the system operating modes, which might result in mis-operation of the relay. In this paper, an approach for on-line identifying system equivalent impedance is presented based on PMU measurements.

All information of therapists and patients is administrated digitally through a three-layer administration framework. A multi-modal training method library is developed to assist therapists in formulating individualized passive rehabilitation training programs for various patients. What's more, we propose a safety protection strategy for the safety of patients based on a joint angle filtering algorithm.

Hence, intelligent robots have diverse applications in domains such as security, automation, industry and agriculture. Such robots when used for surveillance or spying operations by military or police forces are called spybots. This paper aims to highlight the need and importance of developing systems that have the ability to remotely control their functions, response and operation, using multiple-controls and commands given by multiple-modalities. As an example, to give a live physical demonstration of the proposed concepts, a prototype smart spybot is developed. The prototype spybot can be controlled using multi-modalities such as text, touch, speech and gestures. It can be remotely operated using an application running on an Android based smart-phone, or a website, or an interactive program running on a laptop. Each can be connected by wires or wirelessly. The prototype spybot also has decision making capability and obstacle-avoidance feature. It is GPS enabled, and can be used as a tracker also. This intelligent spybot can directly fetch the live-video feeds and the spied data to a website, along with GPS coordinates. Since the prototype spybot is speech and gesture-enabled, it can also be used effectively by the people having restricted physical abilities. The initial performance results and trials are encouraging. The prototype spybot can potentially be used for a range of applications.","","978-1-5090-2029-4","10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7732254","intelligent spybot;multi-modal;multi-controls;intelligent robot;obstacle avoidance;GPS enabled","Sensors;Speech;Cameras;Robot kinematics;Speech recognition;Prototypes","collision avoidance;control engineering computing;Global Positioning System;intelligent robots","GPS-enabled multimodal multicontrolled intelligent spybot;Android based smart-phone;Website;interactive program;obstacle-avoidance feature;live-video feeds","","1","","20","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is often viewed as difficult to use due to the elaborate configuration that is needed to ensure correct (and secure) operation. In this paper, we seek to answer the question of how to build IPsec VPNs without affecting the network assets. We exploit ""repeater-encryption"", which is similar to the IPsec bump-in-the-wire mode of operation. Our IPsec encryption unit works at Layer-2 of the network stack and does not encrypt control packets that are used for routing, address resolution and resource reservation. Although this is fairly straightforward for IPv4 networks, IPv6 introduces several new features and messages that complicate the operation of such a box. We report our findings of implementing transparent, repeater-based IPsec protection for IPv4 and IPv6. Our approach requires no configuration changes to other devices in the network, making it an attractive mechanism for security network traffic. We discuss the features of our IPsec encryption unit and show how it adapts to IPv4 and IPv6 networks. We also implement our approach on the OpenBSD IPsec stack to demonstrate its feasibility. We show that our transparent IPsec box can easily support speeds in excess of 100 Mbps.","2332-5798","1-4244-0000-7","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635498","","Repeaters;Cryptography;Bridges;Protection;Computer science;Virtual private networks;Routing;Data security;Protocols;Communication system traffic control","cryptography;telecommunication security;IP networks","repeater encryption unit;1Pv4 networks;1Pv6 networks;IPsec;network communications security;repeater-encryption;IPsec encryption unit","","1","1","11","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such formatted EHRs form an attribute-value type database, where both the attribute values and unique identities can serve as keywords for searching. Since EHRs are very sensitive, they are always encrypted before being outsourced, which makes retrieval of target EHRs by either identity or attribute value hard. Moreover, the EHRs are encrypted by different doctors, a researcher, who is delegated to research a certain kind of disease, cannot find out all corresponding EHRs due to the difference of encryption keys. In this article, we construct a triple dictionary index structure for the attribute-value type database to allow a researcher to retrieve encrypted EHRs by the identity and attribute value and to perform dynamic operations over them. We employ an identity server to assist doctors in generating encryption keys via an oblivious way. By doing so, the researcher can retrieve encrypted EHRs without leaking any information to the identity server.

The successful utilization of DSRs relies heavily upon the infrastructure of advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs). Notably, ICT systems may suffer from cyber attacks and communication latency, which could result in the malfunctions of DSRs and consequently bring adverse impacts on the reliability of power systems. In this paper, a novel operating reliability evaluation framework for multi-state power systems with DSRs and wind power considering malfunctions of cyber systems is proposed. For avoiding increasing complexity caused by multiple system states, an analytic method based on Lz transform technique is proposed to achieve dynamic system reliability. The reliability model for a typical hierarchical decentralized control infrastructure in demand side considering cyber attacks and communication latency is first proposed. Then, reserve capacity from DSRs considering stochastic behavior under the cyber infrastructure is modelled. Moreover, multi-state models for power generation systems with stochastic wind power and conventional generation are developed considering cyber malfunctions. Reliability indices based on load curtailment by conducting optimal power flow for various system states are utilized for reliability assessment. A modified IEEE RTS with four cases is adopted to validate the proposed model and method, which denotes that reserve capacity from DSRs can definitely enhance system operating reliability and affected by proportions of DSRs, consideration of cyber malfunctions, actual committed time for DSRs and initial system conditions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992636","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019TQ0090); National Social Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:19ZDA081); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086434","Operating reliability evaluation;DSRs;cyber security;cyber attacks;communication latency;Lz~transform method","Reliability;Transforms;Power system reliability;Cyberattack;Wind power generation","demand side management;load flow;optimisation;power engineering computing;power generation reliability;security of data;stochastic processes;wind power plants","operating reliability evaluation framework;cyber malfunctions;initial system conditions;system operating reliability;reliability assessment;optimal power flow;reliability indices;stochastic wind power;power generation systems;multistate models;cyber infrastructure;reliability model;dynamic system reliability;multiple system states;cyber systems;multistate power systems;communication latency;cyber attacks;ICT systems;high wind power penetration;reserve capacity;DSRs;demand-side resources","","3","","33","CCBY","5 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Network intrusion detection system (NIDS) plays a vital function in defending computer networks and systems. However, several issues concerning the sustainability and feasibility of existing techniques are faced with recent networks. These concerns are directly related to the rising levels of necessary human interactions and reducing the level of detection accuracy. Several approaches are designed to detect and manage various security threats in a network.

Trusted Computing is a promising new approach for computer security in which a system should be permanently in a well-defined and therefore trustworthy state. The adaption of such concepts for embedded systems with application specific requirements and limitations can provide promising security benefits. Besides, both in the industrial and academical sector a trend has become apparent to develop chips which include programmable cores as well as system reconfigurable components. Resultant chips will not be a single part of an embedded system anymore but rather can be used for the development of a whole system. Thus, FPGAs have become integral parts of embedded computing platforms. The reconfigurability of FPGAs offers major advantages when using them for cryptographic applications and it is suggested that an adaptive hardware-based trust anchor can greatly enhance the overall security level of an embedded system. In this paper we propose a concept of how such an adaptive security module could be designed as well as some possible fields of application.

Since most of the biometric systems only use one modality, it may cause issues such as noise in sensed data, intra-class differences, and similarities between classes, etc. In order to avoid some problems i.e., universality and security purposes multi-modal biometrics are proposed in this work. Multi-modal biometrics uses more than one modality for recognition. Various fusion techniques, including feature level, score level, decision level, etc., will be used to carry out these biometric recognition systems. In this study, we will put into practice a multi-modal biometric face and fingerprint identification system employing feature level fusion. The stages involved in building this system are, firstly it details the preprocessing techniques for both face and fingerprint and then the VGG16 model is built to carry out the further process i.e., extracting the individual features and then the individual model's features are classified using the support vector classifier SVC and got the accuracy of 90% for face and 93% for fingerprint. Next to do the fusion individual features are combined together using concatenation technique. Finally, the combined features are classified using the same classifier which is used for individual models and got the fused accuracy as 97%.

Multi-modal biometric systems are commonly believed to be intrinsically more robust to spoof attacks, but recent works have shown that they can be evaded by spoofing even a single biometric trait. This result was however obtained under the worst-case scenario that the attacker is able to fabricate an exact replica of the genuine biometric trait, which was simulated by assuming that the matching score distribution of fake traits is identical to the one of genuine users. This demands for a more thorough investigation of the robustness of multi-modal biometric systems against realistic spoof attacks, namely under non-worst case scenarios. In this paper we focus on bi-modal systems made up of a face and a fingerprint matcher, whose scores are fused using the well-known sum, product, weighted sum and likelihood ratio (LLR) rules. We evaluate their robustness against realistic spoof attacks obtained by fabricating fake biometric traits. The main goal of our study is to investigate whether a realistic spoof attack against both modalities can allow the attacker to crack the multimodal system. Our results show that even in a realistic, non-worst case scenario, the false acceptance rate (FAR) can remarkably increase.","","978-1-4577-0766-7","10.1109/BIOMS.2011.6053682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6053682","","Face;Robustness;Biometrics;Three dimensional displays;Security;Face recognition;Cameras","authorisation;fingerprint identification;fraud","spoof attack;fake biometric trait;security;multimodal biometric system;matching score distribution;bimodal system;fingerprint matcher;likelihood ratio rule;false acceptance rate","","10","","21","IEEE","31 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The key solution to achieve this goal is to integrate multiple avionic systems, apply new signal processing and RF capabilities. A generalized and reconfigurable architecture of Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) with integrated and modularised structure based on Direct RF Sampling (DRFS) and Software Defined Radio (SDR) is presented in this paper for avionic applications. The proposed architecture is composed of a DRFS digital receiver integrated within a SDR software modules. DRFS technology is adopted in the digital receiver, which consists of Pre-selection Filters and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to provide flexible compatibility for diverse modulation modes and various RF/IF frequency bands. By employing the concept of DRFS/SDR, distinct procedures for different avionic purposes, such as Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) and Instrument Landing System (ILS), can be achieved in the same hardware platform. Notably, this proposed architecture has the potential to be reconfigured and improved in several ways without any hardware change to accommodate new features and signal capabilities. As per experimental validation phase, an MMR integrated system for VOR and ILS receivers has been designed and implemented. Test results have illustrated that the implementation feasibility of multi-mode DRFS avionic receivers is beneficial and efficient using the proposed architecture. Moreover, the benefits obtained from this new approach are not only covering miniaturization, lightweight, and low power consumption but is also promising to overreach the equivalent commercial systems in the future.","2375-5318","978-1-4673-8823-8","10.1109/RADAR.2017.7944467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7944467","Avionic;DRFS;SDR;MMR;IMA;VHF;VOR;ILS","Aerospace electronics;Receivers;Radio frequency;Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Band-pass filters;Mixers","avionics;instrument landing systems;radio receivers;software radio","direct RF sampling;avionic systems;VOR;ILS receiver;aerospace industry;avionic architecture;cost reduction;weight reduction;maintenance complexity;RF efficiency;signal processing;generalized architecture;reconfigurable architecture;multimode receiver;MMR;integrated structure;modularised structure;software defined radio;SDR;DRFS digital receiver;SDR software modules;pre-selection filters;field programmable gate arrays;FPGA;flexible compatibility;diverse modulation modes;RF-IF frequency bands;very-high-frequency omnidirectional range;instrument landing system;hardware platform;MMR integrated system;multimode DRFS avionic receivers;power consumption","","6","","16","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Security is important in data protection so as not to be infringed by unauthorized parties. If the vulnerabilities found are not amended, it leads to cyber-attacks such as Structured Query Language Injection Attack (SQLIA) performed by certain parties which enable them to gain unauthorized data access. To cater security issues, variety of security frameworks for secure software development life cycle (SDLC) were introduced. Secure SDLC is created by integrating security-related activities to an each phase of in used development methodologies such as waterfall model or agile model. However, the application security problem continues to grow. Strict, complicated and heavyweight frameworks are underutilized due to several factors. The factors that influence the implementation of secure SDLC identified in public sector (the scope is State Secretary Offices in Malaysia) are inadequate development timeline, improper development team size and less awareness of team members' workload. It is agreed that integrating security at earlier (requirement and design) phase is the most effective and cheapest way to develop secure web application. Hence, an adaptive secure SDLC model is proposed to integrate security activities using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) focusing on the influence factors as the main criteria and meet the international and local secure frameworks standards. The proposed model will recommend adaptive security activities as a guideline to be applied at earlier phases of SDLC to help eliminate/ minimize the web application vulnerabilities and increase the application security and implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype at selected Malaysian public sector for in-house web application development.","","978-1-5386-6925-9","10.1109/AINS.2018.8631401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8631401","web application;security activities;secure SDLC;in-house web application development;public sector","Security;Software;NIST;Information technology;Testing","analytic hierarchy process;data protection;fuzzy set theory;Internet;security of data;software engineering;SQL","structured query language injection attack;software development life cycle;Malaysian public sector;SQLIA;waterfall model;FAHP;fuzzy analytic hierarchy process;agile model;health organizations;financial organizations;in-house web application development;local secure frameworks standards;international frameworks standards;adaptive secure SDLC model;unauthorized data access;cyber-attacks;data protection","","","","46","IEEE","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The improved K-means clustering algorithm is used to classify key state quantities of the grid. The actual operating state quantity is matched with the classification situation to determine the risk of power grid abandonment and power restriction. Next, determine the best classification number and intra-class data of the data. According to the magnitude of the peak-valley difference, select the data of the photovoltaic and hydropower peak-valley difference and the small peak-valley difference when discarding the light, and verify the load probability of abandoning light by fitting the load data. In the load limit verification, select the load with large peak-to-valley difference and photovoltaic and hydropower data with small peak-to-valley difference, and perform load-limit verification by fitting the hydropower data.

IOV is an integrated service system that can support the applications for automatic driving, intelligent transport and information services. As the number of incidents on IOV has been on the rise in the past few years, IOV security is becoming increasingly important in the IOV architecture. One of the most notable risks of IOV faces is intelligent terminal security. The vehicle's intelligent terminal can be used to launch for further attacks on the on-board operating system to penetrate into the internal network of connected vehicle, and consequently threaten the safety of the vehicle. Thus, it is of paramount importance that we protect the security of the intelligent terminal. We propose two intelligent terminal based privacy-preserving multi-modal implicit authentication protocols to protect the security of the intelligent terminal in IOV. The proposed protocols use the password and the vehicle owner's behavior features as the authentication factors to protect the security of the intelligent terminal. Since the vehicle owner's behavior features are sensitive and the privacy information of the user must be protected, we also consider the privacy protection of the behavior features. Our protocols do not reveal any information about the vehicle owner's behavior features to the authentication server and the adversary except the ciphertext size of the feature vector. We analyze the security of our proposed protocol and compare them with other related protocols in terms of computation and communications costs.

The share in volatile energy sources connected through power electronic components increases, whereas the installed power of grid-connected generators and associated inertia decreases. In this context, critical operating states up to system blackouts, that threaten the security of supply and the access to electical energy, might occur. In order to restore the grid after a blackout in an efficient way, this paper proposes an advanced control concept for high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems using voltage source converters (VSC) in grid-forming mode. VSC-HVDC systems open new restoration paths and offer the possibility to involve healthy grid areas form a far distance to take part in the restoration process. To benefit from the potential of renewable energy sources and energy storage devices to support the process, established restoration strategies are extended by the consistent integration of power electronics and intelligent control schemes. The presented model predictive controller (MPC) enables precise voltage reference tracking inside the restoration area to ensure a grid compatible voltage ramp-up process by avoiding undesireable effects, e.g. inrush phenomena of transformers. Moreover, the grid frequency is used as a system-wide parameter that is used as a physical information channel between the grid-forming VSC-HVDC station and further power converters inside the restoration area. In that way, renewable energy sources and storage devices can contribute to speed up the restoration process while guaranteeing system stability.","","978-9-0758-1528-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8515409","Predictive control;Grid-forming;HVDC transmission;Grid restoration;Predictive reference tracking;Dynamic frequency adaption","Voltage control;Power conversion;HVDC transmission;Europe;Capacitors","HVDC power convertors;HVDC power transmission;intelligent control;optimal control;power grids;power system restoration;power transmission control;predictive control;renewable energy sources;voltage-source convertors","renewable energy sources;restoration process;system stability;frequency-adaptive MPC;grid-forming VSC-HVDC systems;optimal voltage reference tracking;grid restoration strategies gain;electrical power grids;volatile energy sources;grid-connected generators;critical operating states;system blackouts;electical energy;advanced control concept;high voltage direct current systems;voltage source converters;grid-forming mode;energy storage devices;power electronics;intelligent control schemes;precise voltage reference;grid compatible voltage ramp-up;grid frequency;system-wide parameter;grid-forming VSC-HVDC station;power converters;power electronic components;VSC-HVDC systems;restoration strategies;model predictive controller","","","","7","","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inspired by the game theory, in this research work, we model the interactions between the attacker and the adaptation manager as a two-player zero-sum Markov game. Using this game-theoretic approach, the adaptation manager can refine its strategies in dynamic attack scenarios by utilizing what has learned from the system's and adversary's actions.

Traditionally, safety and security of CPEs are addressed separately, the former dealing with failures in the physical part, the latter with breaches in the cyber part. While physical aging is often accounted for, it is not for the cyber elements although it may have an impact on CPEs controllability, stability and, ultimately, reliability. In this paper, we propose a dynamic reliability assessment framework that embeds a multi-state cyber aging model of literature into a Goal Tree Success Tree-Master Logic Diagram (GTST-MLD) that accounts for both stochastic hardware components failures and cyber aging that may open breaches for cyber attacks to the control system.

As a result, the state estimation results for smart grid will be inaccurate, affecting the precise analysis and control of the smart grid’s current operating state. This paper proposes an ADMM-based distributed state estimate approach and a Markov attack detection mechanism to address the constraints of traditional state estimate and location of cyber-attacks. First, through separating power grid into many regions, we propose a distributed alternate direction state estimation approach based on multipliers that reduces the power system’s communication and computational expense. Second, by adopting presented combination attack model of false data injection attack and DoS attack, a Markov attack detecting mechanism based on distributed state estimate is developed. Finally, experimental results on the IEEE Bus-118 system demonstrate that our model has better efficiency and accuracy of suggested distributed state estimation and attack detection methods.","2688-0938","978-1-6654-6533-5","10.1109/CAC57257.2022.10054689","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054689","Distributed states estimation;false data injection attack;DoS attack;Markov","Computational modeling;Distributed databases;Markov processes;Power system stability;Stability analysis;Smart grids;Safety","computer crime;computer network security;convex programming;cyber-physical systems;power engineering computing;power system measurement;power system security;power system state estimation;smart power grids","ADMM;alternating direction multiplier method;combination attack model;cyber attacks;cyber-physical systems;distributed alternate direction state estimation;DoS attack;false data injection attack;IEEE Bus-118 system;Markov attack detection mechanism;power grid;power system communication;smart grid monitoring","","","","20","IEEE","13 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The representation of protection functions greatly enhances the accuracy of the transient stability study and leads to a better understanding of power system states during emergency conditions. Although modeling all of the protective relays within transient stability studies may result in a better estimation of system behavior, representing, updating, and maintaining the protection system data becomes an insurmountable task. Inappropriate or outdated representation of the relays may result in incorrect assessment of the system behavior. This paper presents a systematic method to determine essential relays to be modeled in transient stability studies. The desired approach should identify protective relays that are critical for various operating conditions and contingencies. The proposed strategy is verified as a viable technique based on results obtained from the WECC 179-bus and the IEEE 145-bus test cases, while considering various operating states and contingencies.

MBF are expected to be more reliable due to the presence of multiple independent pieces of biometric traits. The aim of these multibiometric systems is to achieve a high reliability to determine or verify person's identity. The motivation for using fuzzy logic is that it offers methods best suited to model the information that is inherently uncertain and ambiguous. This paper implements score level fusion based on fuzzy logic for developing Fuzzy Rule Based (FRB) MBF. The matching module integrates fuzzy logic methods for matching score fusion. This approach is tested on the fingerprint and face score database of 102 people obtained from NIST BSSR1 database.

To prevent such attacks, presentation attack detection (PAD) techniques have been proposed in the last decade. For the particular case of fingerprints, most approaches are based on conventional optical or capacitive sensors, acquiring a single image, and which can thus detect only a limited number of PAIs. In this work, we present a new multi-modal PAD approach based on a recently developed capture device, which is able to acquire four different types of samples: i) finger photos, ii) finger vein samples, iii) multi-spectral short wave infrared images, and iv) laser speckle contrast image sequence samples. Different ad-hoc algorithms have been developed for each set of images.

However, the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant strategies for CGRAs apply either temporal or spatial scheme, including redundancy, periodic detection, workload balancing, and reconfiguration, failing to exploit the feature of dynamic and partial reconfiguration of CGRAs. Also, vulnerable judging circuits and inflexible mode shifting bottleneck the reliability design of fault-tolerant CGRAs. This paper proposes a novel multi-mode fault-tolerant framework for CGRAs, which combines spatial-redundant data-paths with temporal-redundant voters and thus reduces the vulnerable judging circuits while balancing the performance and reliability. This framework can also enable a changing reliability level at runtime via an online configuration transformation method based on pre-compiled patterns. Within the proposed framework, we systematically searched the design space spanning various combinations of the mainstream schemes with a Markov process model to compare the effectiveness and accordingly selected five points as available modes in our design after comprehensive consideration of fault tolerance and time overhead on CGRA. The framework is comprehensively evaluated on a cycle-accurate CGRA simulator, considering both permanent and transient faults. The experimental results show that the fault coverage rate of single transient faults or permanent faults has increased from 71.74% to 93.84%, which means the fault tolerance of the system has been increased by 31.03% compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

To ensure reliable system operation, monitoring, control and protection have to be improved. In this paper, new Hierarchically Coordinated Protection (HCP) approach to mitigate the effects of increased grid complexity on its operation is proposed. The proposed approach utilizes local and wide area measurements and relies on the three HCP framework levels: fault anticipation and prediction, adaptive fault detection, and relay operation correction in case of unwanted tripping. It brings intelligence to the relays at all voltage levels and uses information and statistics from the systems such as weather, lightning, animal and bird migration patterns, component outage history, etc to enhance protection system tripping dependability and security.","","978-1-84919-715-1","10.1049/cp.2012.2039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6521880","adaptive relaying;distributed generation;neural nets;protective relaying;synchronized sampling","","distributed power generation;power distribution faults;power distribution protection;power distribution reliability;power generation faults;power generation protection;power generation reliability;relay protection;smart power grids","smart grid operation;hierarchically coordinated protection approach;generation patterns;power system configuration switching;distributed generation high penetration;conventional relays;reliable system operation;reliable system monitoring;reliable system control;reliable system protection;HCP approach;grid complexity;wide area measurements;fault anticipation;fault prediction;adaptive fault detection;relay operation correction;unwanted tripping;voltage levels;protection system tripping dependability;protection system tripping security","","5","","","","30 May 2013","","","IET","IET Conferences"

However the security and privacy challenges have been a concern. This is because shared data may contain some private and sensitive information of data owners or users. So it has been an important issue to balance data utilization, data privacy and users privacy. Privacy-preserving multi-authority attribute-based encryption (MA-ABE) is a promising tool to tackle this issue, but it cannot be directly applied to addressed scenario of smart power grid systems. In this paper, we propose a framework to achieve secure data sharing in smart grid. The scheme uses the technique of inner product encryption (IPE). Under this framework, the access policy and the attribute set are fuzzy by converting them into two vectors. Only when the two vectors are orthogonal, users can successfully obtain the sharing data. Besides, our scheme allows that the threshold access policy only involves attribute name indexes, and sensitive attribute values are not sent along with the shared data so the attribute privacy is preserved. In addition, in order to improve efficiency, our scheme adds a testing phase to avoid the unnecessary operation before recovering data. Finally, our performance analysis and experiments confirm the merits of the proposed framework.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970272","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872087); National Cryptography Development Fund(grant numbers:MMJJ20180209); Key Research Project of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2018GY-018); International S&T Cooperation Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2019KW-056); Plan For Scientific Innovation Talent of Henan Province(grant numbers:184100510012); Program for Science and Technology Innovation Talents in the Universities of Henan Province(grant numbers:18HASTIT022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8974262","Privacy-preserving;smart grid;multi-authority access control;adaptive security;IPE","Smart grids;Access control;Privacy;Cryptography;Data privacy;Real-time systems","authorisation;cryptography;data privacy;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids;vectors","privacy-preserving multiauthority attribute-based encryption;threshold access policy;vectors;inner product encryption;secure data sharing;user privacy;privacy-preserving multiauthority attribute-based data sharing framework;attribute privacy;sensitive attribute values;attribute name indexes;attribute set;secure data;data privacy;data utilization;data owners;data security;real-time electricity data sharing;smart power grid systems","","19","","30","CCBY","29 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, it becomes imperative to guarantee for all GNSS users the compatibility, interoperability and interchangeability between all these systems. The goal is to ensure that the user's multi-mode receiver can choose and mix signals from different GNSS and SBAS systems to achieve more availability, accuracy and robustness. Attaining that objective will require agreements on frequency plans and signal designs, as well as other details including means to ensure interoperability of system times and geodetic reference systems. This paper suggests a Universal-SBAS (U-SBAS) standard, compatible with all the existing and planned regional GNSS systems (and their evolutions) in the world, like IRNSS, QZSS, PCW, BEIDOU-1, WAAS, EGNOS, SDCM, GAGAN, MSAS.

The study was conducted at Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa, and followed a qualitative and interpretive research design to collect data for the ideal deployment of multi-modal access control systems in the hospital. Surveys were distributed to workers in the hospital who require access to patient records - such as clinicians and administrators. The survey resulted in an 86% response rate. The results revealed key problem areas which related to a lack of user awareness and acceptance. One of the key problems was that 79% of respondents indicated they have never had any security awareness sessions or training. Insights from the survey were used to create a framework.

These systems have greater advantages over traditional systems that are difficult to break and provide good anti-spoofing abilities. Use of these systems has increased in recent years owing to the increasing trend of thefts, breaking of security systems, hacking and another means of unauthorized access. In this paper a multimodal recognition algorithm using palm print and palm vein images. The palm print image is rich in line features as it consists of wrinkles, ridges and principal lines. On the other hand the palm vein image contains rich texture features in the form of blood vessel patterns also called as vein patterns. A multimodal identification system has been proposed in this paper which uses Contourlet transform to analyze the features present in palm print and palm vein images. The proposed algorithm captures local minutae and a global feature from a palm print and palm vein images and stores them as a compact code. After extraction of the ROI from the source images the (2-D) image spectrum is divided into fine sub-components (called subbands) using iterated directional filter bank structure. The feature matching technique is then performed using Euclidean Distance algorithm. For this algorithm CASIA Palm print Database V1.0 is used.","2325-9418","978-1-4799-2275-8","10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726010","Biometrics;Contourlet transform;Palm print;palm vein;Euclidean distance","Veins;Feature extraction;Transforms;Gabor filters;Filter banks;Image resolution;Laplace equations","authorisation;channel bank filters;computer crime;discrete transforms;feature extraction;image matching;image texture;palmprint recognition;vein recognition;visual databases","antispoofing abilities;multimodal biometric recognition systems;multimodal recognition algorithm;palm print images;palm vein images;palm print features;palm vein features;line features;wrinkles;ridges;principal lines;texture features;blood vessel patterns;vein patterns;multimodal identification system;contourlet transform;local minutae;global feature;ROI extraction;source images;2-D image spectrum subcomponents;subbands;iterated directional filter bank structure;feature matching technique;Euclidean distance algorithm;CASIA palm print database V1.0","","8","","11","IEEE","30 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Owing to its adaptive nature in delivering a dynamic rule base, it is particularly useful for those systems which experience frequent changes. Network security is one such area where frequent changes are quite likely due to changing network conditions and traffic. Thus, D-FRI has the potential to offer an optimised and adaptive approach for improving network security. The popular Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Firewall is capable of monitoring and alerting a range of common threats, by baselining the traffic of a network and analysing the statistics of dropped packets. An ASA process yields a large volume of statistical information relating to certain security events. Yet, threat detection is a rudimentary function since additional intelligence is required to automate the extraction of meaningful information for alerting the users. This could be achieved using expensive automated tools offered by a third party, but doing so may unnecessarily expose an organisation to other security threats. This paper takes a different approach, presenting a DFRI-CiscoFirewall in support of automated threat detection for Cisco ASA Firewall. Through utilising threat detection statistics, the approach can customise the detection process according to organisational requirements. It performs the relative analysis of prioritised security events and is able to predict comprehensive security situations while no matching rules are available. In particular, the approach supports the creation of a dynamic rule base, derived from changing network conditions and traffic density. Its efficacy is demonstrated by experimental evaluations.","1558-4739","978-1-5386-1728-1","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2019.8858999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8858999","","Firewalls (computing);Interpolation;Fuzzy logic;Monitoring;Access control;Communication networks","computer network management;firewalls;fuzzy reasoning;interpolation;knowledge based systems;security of data","dynamic fuzzy rule interpolation;Cisco ASA Firewall;sparse rule-based fuzzy reasoning;dynamic rules;dynamic rule base;network security;optimised approach;adaptive approach;security threats;automated threat detection;threat detection statistics;prioritised security events;comprehensive security situations;matching rules;D-FRI-CiscoFirewall;Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Firewall","","5","","19","Crown","11 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An initial study has concluded that the use of a hybrid ESS/wind farm under the NETA conditions would result in an increase in operating revenue. However preliminary protection investigations have highlighted concerns over appropriate control and protection under the particular scenarios of a change in operating mode from load (i.e. as an electrolyser) to a generator (i.e. to a fuel cell) and vice versa. Work is continuing to produce more detailed modelling results of such a system.

Scientist and researchers have constantly pursued the technology for automated confirmation of the identity of subjects based on measurements of physiological or behavioral traits of humans. But even the best single biometric system suffers from spoof attacks, intra-class variability, noise, susceptibility etc. To address this issue, we develop a hybrid multibiometric system which integrates multi-algorithm and multi-modal approaches of multibiometric system and use bilevel fusion to combine biometric information. We use face, ear and signature biometric traits which are first classified by three classification techniques-multilayer perceptron, Fisher-image and Bayesian network. The outcomes of these classifiers for face are fused by rank fusion method. Outcomes for ear and signature are also fused similarly. The second level fusion occurs when we combine the results of these three rank fusion methods' outcomes for face, ear and signature with decision fusion method. We use Borda count and Borda fuse approaches for rank fusion and majority voting, weighted majority voting and behavioral knowledge space approaches for decision fusion. The final results indicate that this hybrid multi biometric system outperforms the single biometric systems build on the same data using the same classification algorithms. This system can be effectively used in law enforcement or homeland security department or for commercial purposes.","","978-1-4244-2773-4","10.1109/CIB.2009.4925691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925691","","Security;Biometrics;Ear;Voting;Authentication;Access control;Electrical equipment industry;Industrial control;Humans;Bayesian methods","authorisation;belief networks;multilayer perceptrons","hybrid multibiometric system;access control;automated identity confirmation;biometric user authentication techniques;spoof attacks;intra-class variability;multi-modal approaches;biometric information;bilevel fusion;multilayer perceptron;Fisherimage;Bayesian network;rank fusion method;decision fusion method;Borda count;Borda fuse approaches;majority voting;behavioral knowledge space approaches","","3","","36","IEEE","15 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Papalexopoulos","ECCO International, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA","IEEE Power Engineering Society Summer Meeting,","26 Sep 2005","2002","3","","1168 vol.3","","Summary form only given as follows. The FERC in its RTO Order 2000 reaffirms the requirement that an RTO must (1) encourage market-motivated operating and investment actions for preventing and relieving congestion; (2) accommodate efforts by state regulatory commissions to create multi-state agreements to review and approve new transmission facilities, coordinated with programs of existing Regional Transmission Groups (RTGs) where necessary; and (3) file a plan with the FERC with specified milestones that will ensure that it meets the overall planning and expansion requirement no later than three years after initial operation, if the RTO is unable to satisfy this requirement when it commences operation. In the alternative, the RTO must demonstrate that an alternative proposal is consistent with or superior to these three requirements. The FERC expresses its preference for market-based plans, and noted that the pricing mechanisms and actions used by the RTO as part of its transmission planning and expansion program should be compatible with the pricing signals for shorter-term solutions to transmission constraints (i.e., congestion management) so that market participants can choose the least-cost response. Development and implementation of transmission projects remains a major challenge in the new competitive environment. Alternative business models including RTOs, and Transcos have been proposed as the best infrastructure under which appropriate transmission investments can be made to ensure the security of the transmission grid at least cost. This presentation discusses the various analytical approaches for evaluating prospective transmission projects. Two areas of particular difficulty are also discussed. These are: dealing with uncertainty and the interdependence of transmission and generation investment. Finally, the incorporation of market power in the wholesale electricity market into the transmission evaluation process is also discussed.","","0-7803-7518-1","10.1109/PESS.2002.1043470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1043470","","Power system planning;Pricing;Investments;Meeting planning;Proposals;Security;Costs;Uncertainty;Electricity supply industry","power transmission planning;power transmission economics;investment;costing;power markets","FERC;power system expansion planning;power system pricing;deregulated environment;RTO Order 2000;market-motivated operating actions;market-motivated investment actions;congestion prevention;congestion relief;state regulatory commissions;new transmission facilities approval;Regional Transmission Groups;market-based plans;pricing mechanisms;transmission constraints;congestion management;least-cost response;uncertainty;generation investment;transmission investment;wholesale electricity market;transmission evaluation process","","2","","","IEEE","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The importance of trust in a Layered Sensing construct","M. Nowak","Autonomic Trusted Sensing of Persistent Intelligence Division, Air Force Research Laboratory, Dayton, OH, USA","2010 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems","3 Jun 2010","2010","","","555","556","The technological advances of the information age have created both an opportunity and a challenge for military decision makers. At first glance, the variety of data gathered by a multitude of traditional and non-traditional Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors should allow decision makers to better understand their environment and the threat. However, a number of factors tend to erode this advantage. Incompatible data formats, bandwidth limitations, sensor persistence and revisit rates, and multi-level security issues are but a few of the technical challenges that preclude end users from being able to take full advantage of the sensor information. Further, as the amount of sensor data increases, real challenges emerge in identifying the most salient pieces of information, fusing that with other relevant sensor modalities, and rapidly moving this information in a presentation format that does not overwhelm the decision maker. It was this problem space of improving information understanding to increase the situational awareness of decision makers that spawned the Layered Sensing vision. Layered Sensing has grown from an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate initiative into an AFRL effort that seeks to bring fused, multi-source, multi-spectral, multi-dimensional (e.g. cultural, environmental, etc.) information to decision makers consistent with their needs, regardless of their location. The end goal of Layered Sensing is to improve the situational awareness of decision makers by providing them with tailored sensor information. In essence, Layered Sensing is a Sensing Oriented Architecture where the customer can provide or request information tailored to their needs in order to facilitate situational awareness. The benefits of Layered Sensing extend beyond military application. For example, the Department of Homeland Security is one federal agency that could potentially face many of the same information challenge in operations as diverse as providing a common operating picture during a post-Katrina type reconstitution scenario or in fusing multi-source and multi-mode data (e.g. HUMINT, electronic intercepts, etc) in order to track or capture a suspected terrorist. Regardless of who implements a Layered Sensing architecture, the critical attribute of “trust” will have to be addressed - trusted information, trusted communication and trusted sensors. Trust is the sine qua non for any Layered Sensing implementation as it is difficult, if not impossible, to build situational awareness upon inaccurate, misleading, or maliciously modified information. The challenge of instilling and measuring trust in a system has many components. At the sensor node the issue of trust is one of ensuring the sensor works as intended and has not been compromised or co-opted. Between sensors, communications paths must be reliable, secure, and robust enough to recover from equipment degradation or malfunctions. Ideally, the local and global architecture should be autonomic with the ability to optimize sensor and communication performance. Finally, there needs to be a means to measure and portray the overall architecture trust picture status to those who are using it. The use of commercial off-the-shelf equipment, while cost effective, introduces its own trust issues due to uncontrollable supply chains. Relying solely on components from trusted sources is not feasible either economically or practically. As Layered Sensing moves from local architectures supporting an urban scenario to a global scenario the issue of complexity will arise. Seamlessly integrating a large number of spatially and temporally distributed heterogeneous sensors will require effective means to authenticate the new arrivals. Dynamic bandwidth allocation to account for optimal data transmission will also be important. Encompassing all of these trust issues is a way to measure and portray a “trust picture” to users. Instinctively, decision makers weigh the accuracy of data they receive based on their experiences with those data sources. For example, live-feed imagery will likely carry more weight in forming the user's situational awareness of a battle space rather than dated intelligence reports or HUMINT. For sensor derived information, the measure of trust of data is a function of the sensor, the environment it's operating in, the networks transmitting that data, and the fusion engine used to correlate the information. It's important these metrics of trust be available to the decision maker particularly if he/she is predisposed to rely on certain sensors/information sources over others. This conference represents the third time papers and studies have been presented that address the challenges associated with Layered Sensing. The purpose of this presentation is to provide a lead-in that introduces the concepts of Layered Sensing and lays the groundwork for subsequent session papers focused on the various aspects of trust.","","978-1-4244-6622-1","10.1109/CTS.2010.5478463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5478463","Layered sensing;trust;autonomic networks;situation awareness","Intelligent sensors;Terrorism;Surveillance;Reconnaissance;Bandwidth;Data security;Information security;Force sensors;Sensor fusion;Cultural differences","decision making;military computing;security of data;sensor fusion","layered sensing construct;information age;military decision makers;intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance;bandwidth limitations;sensor persistence;multilevel security;layered sensing vision;air force research laboratory;tailored sensor information;homeland security department;trusted information;trusted communication;trusted sensors;optimal data transmission;sensing oriented architecture","","","","","IEEE","3 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Managing traditional desktop environments is incredibly challenging and costly. Tasks like installations, configuration changes, security measures require time-consuming procedures and dedicated deskside support. Also these distributed desktops are typically underutilized, resulting in low ROI for these assets. Further, this distributed computing model for desktops also creates a security concern as sensitive information could be compromised with stolen laptops or PCs. Desktop virtualization, which moves computation to the data center, allows users to access their applications and data using stateless ldquothin-clientldquo devices and therefore alleviates some of the problems of traditional desktop computing. Enterprises can now leverage the flexibility and cost-benefits of running users' desktops on virtual machines hosted at the data center to enhance business agility and reduce business risks, while lowering TCO. Recent research and development of cloud computing paradigm opens new possibilities of mass hosting of desktops and providing them as a service. However, transformation of legacy systems to desktop clouds as well as proper capacity provisioning is a challenging problem. Desktop cloud needs to be appropriately designed and provisioned to offer low response time and good working experience to desktop users while optimizing back-end resource usage and therefore minimizing provider's costs. This paper presents tools and approaches we have developed to facilitate fast and accurate planning for desktop clouds.

In this article, a puncturable identity-based PRE (P-IB-PRE) scheme is proposed to efficiently protect the security and privacy of the group message. The proposed scheme introduces a message server as the proxy to transform ciphertext for each participant in the group; thus, the heavy computation overhead is delegated to the message server with abundant resources. Most importantly, our scheme enables the recipient to revoke its private key’s decryption capability of the specific messages without affecting other messages. Moreover, the identity-based mechanism eliminates the burden of certificate management as well as improves efficiency. The proposed scheme achieves adaptive security under the standard decisional bilinear Diffie–Hellman (DBDH) assumption.

Such severe disturbances effect voltage phasor, current phasor and system frequency. So, to better monitor the dynamics of large power system, wide area synchronized monitoring of voltage phasor, current phasor and system frequency is vital. For efficient real time monitoring and operation of power system, high resolution based phasor measurement units (PMUs) should be used. PMU can accurately measure node and branch phasors at high sampling rate. In this paper, application of PMUs to monitor power quality and voltage instability due to contingency is shown. The paper proposes a novel approach for contingency filtering and assessment in sense of power quality and voltage instability. The approach consists of two-block technique: first block filters out dangerous contingency; then second block assesses it for severity based upon performance index. Another application is to understand system dynamics during different kinds of disturbance such as generator trip or load rejection. To realize this logic-based approach is used for analysis. This will help the operator in real time analysis of system as a whole and in deciding the nature and location of disturbance. Overall, it will help to detect emergency condition and take necessary control action in real time.

In recent years, multi-modal methods had been proven to be effective in prediction of AD and MCI by utilizing the complementary information across different modalities in AD data. In this paper, we propose self-paced sample weighting based low-rank representation (SPLRR) to explore the latent correlation across different modalities. By imposing rank minimization on different modalities regression coefficients, we can capture the intrinsic structure among modalities. Meanwhile, we introduce self-paced learning to allot the corresponding weight to samples based on the contribution of each sample to the label in the current modality.

But the recognition of face can be affected by illumination variation, facial expression and other issues. Therefore, the authentication using only face image might be difficult for the system. To overcome this challenge, biometric authentications have to rely on more than one method. In this paper, we consider audio-video person authentication based on two sources of information. Single modality evidence has limitations in both security and robustness. Therefore, here, audio recognition is added with visual recognition. Facial features, as well as speech is extracted separately from audio-visual data and integrate both the modality for secure user authentication. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is used as the speech feature. Viola-Jones and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm are used for visual feature extraction. After the extraction of audio and visual features, the feature selection method is employed. The two-phase algorithm consisting of statistical analysis, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) is proposed to select significant features from audio-visual data. The Audio and Video processing is done in two separate phases using machine learning algorithms. The results of both the modalities are then combined at the decision level based on majority voting.

The DES-SRAM self-encrypts each 64 bit block of its own data in 17 clock cycles.","","0-7803-8182-3","10.1109/SOC.2003.1241452","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1241452","","Random access memory;Hardware;Public key cryptography;Data security;Public key;Logic;Portals;Clocks;System-on-a-chip;Software algorithms","cryptography;SRAM chips;industrial property;system-on-chip;logic design","crypto-SRAM;self-encrypting DES-SRAM IP-core;SRAM embedded DES;secure SoC;optimized DES hardware implementation;DES secret key algorithm;data encryption standard;data transfer suppression;64 bit","","2","2","9","IEEE","3 Nov 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the past decade, False Data Injection (FDI) attacks have attracted extensive attention, as they provide a strategy to introduce bias to SE results by maliciously modifying measurements in a way that can bypass BDD. Regrettably, although FDI attacks are plausible in math, whether they are feasible in practice has not been paid enough attention. This paper tries to give an answer by formulating three FDI attack vectors, each exploiting the vulnerability of a different communication protocol to achieve background reconnaissance and data tampering. Based on the proposed attack vectors, the path of launching FDI attacks in a concrete cyber environment and the corresponding defense countermeasures are analyzed through cyber-physical co-simulation. Case studies demonstrate that applying classical countermeasures, such as cryptographic techniques and access control policies, can effectively frustrate FDI attacks in the real world. Futhermore, it can be summarized from the experiments that attackers may leverage side-effects of defense countermeasures to mount more subtle attacks. It is essential to consider defending against cyber-physical attacks from an overall perspective in the future.","","979-8-3503-2117-3","10.1109/PandaFPE57779.2023.10140382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10140382","attack vector;cyber-physical power system;false data injection attack;cyber-physical co-simulation;state estimation","Access control;Protocols;Reconnaissance;Data models;Power systems;Cryptography;State estimation","access protocols;authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;cyber-physical systems;state estimation","access control policies;accurate operating states;background reconnaissance;Bad Data Detection;BDD;classical countermeasure perspective;communication protocol;concrete cyber environment;cryptographic techniques;cyber-physical attacks;cyber-physical co-simulation;data tampering;defense countermeasures;False Data Injection attacks;FDI attack vectors;measurement outliers;redundant field measurements;SE results;simulation implementation;State Estimation","","","","17","IEEE","9 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider the observer with messages and the input with keys to be the transmitting agents. The optimal linearization technique is utilized to obtain the exact linear models of a chaotic system for operating states of interest.

Real-time successful identification of false data injection attacks is an indispensable requirement to ensure secure and reliable grid operation. State forecasting driven detection models can effectively determine the deviations of the operating states due to FDIA. This work showcases a scalable deep neural network based state forecasting policy which is capable of detecting FDIAs in real-time.

While the abundance of data could improve system efficiency, it poses major reliability challenges. In particular, state estimation aims to find the operating state of a network from the telemetered data, but an undetected attack on the data could lead to making wrong operational decisions for the system and trigger a large-scale blackout. Nevertheless, understanding the vulnerability of state estimation with regards to cyberattacks, which is a special instance of graph-structured quadratic sensing problem, has been hindered by the lack of tools for studying the topological and data-analytic aspects of networks. Algorithmic robustness is critical in extracting reliable information from abundant but untrusted grid data. For a large-scale power grid, we quantify, analyze, and visualize the regions of the network that are not robust to cyberattacks in the sense that there exists a data manipulation strategy for each of those local regions that misleads the operator at the global scale and yields a wrong estimation of the state of the network at almost all buses. We also propose an optimization-based graphical boundary defense mechanism to identify the border of the geographical area in which data have been manipulated. The proposed method does not allow a local attack to have a global effect on the data analysis of the entire network, which enhances the situational awareness of the grid, especially in the face of adversity.

In order to alleviate these problems, multi-modal biometric systems are proposed by combining various biometric modalities to improve the robustness of person authentication. A typical application is to combine both audio and face for multimodal person recognition, since either face or voice is among the most natural biometrics that people use to identify each other. In this paper, a novel approach called multi-feature subspace analysis (MFSA) is proposed for audio-video based biometric person recognition. In the MFSA framework, each face sequence or utterance is represented with a fix-length feature vector, and then subspace analysis method is performed on a collection of random subspaces to construct an ensemble of classifiers for robust recognition.

In addition, the public key allows us to encrypt to an unbounded number of users. Our system is the first to achieve such parameters. We give two versions of our scheme: a simpler version which we prove to be selectively secure in the standard model under a new, but non-interactive assumption, and another version that employs the new dual system encryption technique of Waters to obtain adaptive security under the d-BDH and decisional Linear assumptions. Second, we show that our techniques can be used to realize Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) systems with nonmonotonic access formulas, where our key storage is significantly more efficient than previous solutions.

However, in robot applications, the conditions are far severer compared to the traditional biometric security systems. The robots should be able to recognize users non-intrusively, which confines the available biometric features to face and voice. Also, the robots are expected to recognize users from relatively afar, which inevitably deteriorates the accuracy of each recognition module. In this paper, we tried to improve the overall accuracy by integrating the evidences issued by independently developed face and speaker recognition modules. Each recognition module exhibits different statistical characteristics in representing its confidence of the recognition. Therefore, it is essential to transform the evidences to a normalized form to integrate the results. This paper introduces a novel approach to integrate mutually independent multiple evidences to achieve an improved performance. Typical approach to this problem is to model the statistical characteristics of the evidences by well-known parametric form such as Gaussian. Using Mahalanobis distance is a good example. However, the characteristics of the evidences often do not fit into the parametric models, which results in performance degradation. To overcome this problem, we adopted a discrete PDF that can model the statistical characteristics as it is. To confirm the validity of the proposed method, we used a multi-modal database that consists of 10 registered users and 550 probe data. Each probe data contains face image and voice signal. Face and speaker recognition modules are applied to generate respective evidences. The experiment showed an improvement of 11.27% in accuracy compared to the individual recognizers, which is 2.72% better than the traditional Mahalanobis distance approach.","1944-9437","978-1-4244-1634-9","10.1109/ROMAN.2007.4415170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4415170","","Speaker recognition;Probability density function;Biometrics;Character recognition;Probes;Intelligent robots;Service robots;Security;Face recognition;Speech recognition","biometrics (access control);face recognition;Gaussian processes;intelligent robots;probability;robot vision;service robots;speaker recognition","face recognition systems;speaker recognition systems;discrete probability density function;user recognition;intelligent service robots;biometric security systems;Gaussian parametric;Mahalanobis distance;statistical characteristics","","1","","10","IEEE","16 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A combined objective function appropriate for various system load levels with suitable constraints for the treatment of power system security and economy is also proposed. For the real-time voltage/receiver power control, a suboptimal power flow procedure has been derived by using the reduced set of control variables. This procedure is based on sensitivity theory applied to the determination of zones for the secondary voltage/reactive power control and a corresponding reduced set of regulating sources, whose reactive outputs represent control variables in the optimal power flow program. As a result, the optimal power flow program output becomes a schedule to be used by operators in the process of the real-time voltage/reactive power control in both normal and emergency operating states.<>","","","10.1109/PICA.1989.38983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=38983","","Load flow;Reactive power control;Voltage control;Control systems;Reactive power;Power system security;Power system control;Power systems;Centralized control;Power generation","load flow;power control;power system computer control;reactive power;voltage control","voltage control;real-time control;Newton optimal power flow;sparse matrix techniques;reactive power control;transmission networks;computer program;power system security;sensitivity theory","","3","3","20","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The COVID-19 is virulent and spreads widely. An outbreak in one region often triggers the spread of others, and regions with relatively close association would show a strong correlation in the spread of the epidemic. In the real world, many factors affect the spread of the outbreak between regions. These factors exist in the form of multimodal data, such as the time-series data of the epidemic, the geographic relationship, and the strength of social contacts between regions. However, most of the current work only uses historical epidemic data or single-modal geographic location data to forecast the spread of the epidemic, ignoring the correlation and complementarity in multi-modal data and its impact on the disease spread between regions. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal InformatioN fusion COVID-19 Epidemic forecasting model (MINE). It fuses inter-regional and intra-regional multi-modal information to capture the temporal and spatial relevance of the COVID-19 spread in different regions.

The increase in bots breaking CAPTCHAs shows the ineffectiveness of the text-based CAPTCHAs that are used on most websites and Webmail services today. Bots can easily read the distorted letters and words using optical character recognition (OCR) or break the CAPTCHA using a dictionary attack.

In a normal operation mode, where the grid-connection is available, the energy and reserve of local resources and energy trading with the main grid is scheduled to maximize the operator's profit considering feasible islanding. In a resilient operating mode, which is triggered by a disturbance in the main grid, the local resources should be scheduled to supply loads with the lowest emergency load shedding. To balance the economy and security requirements under uncertainties, the optimal scheduling is done properly through a security-constrained power flow method by considering system's objectives and constraints. Moreover, to properly handle the uncertainties of the problem, conditional value-at-risk metric is incorporated with the optimization model to control the risk of profit variability.

In this paper, we propose a pedestrian classification method based on the multiple kernel learning framework; standard pixel features (such as spatial derivatives) from both imaging modalities are employed to learn several feature-related basic kernels and a compound kernel is found as an optimized linear combination of basic kernels.

In this paper, we present a distributed approach to multi-robot exploration which always keeps all the robots in communication range. The algorithm is based on a utility function that guarantees communication while using best effort for the exploration itself. The robots randomly sample configuration changes of the overall system, i.e., the set of the next best joined movements based on this utility function. This process can be very well distributed with very few communication overhead by having each robot computing a part of the sample and broadcasting its best candidate configuration change found. The globally best candidate among the broadcasted ones is then executed by the team.

This article summarizes power grids as temporal weighted networks (TWNs) which are different from conventional temporal networks. For TWN, the topological structure is fixed but weight distribution is time varying. Then it is noted that for different operating states represented by different weight (power flow) distribution at different time sections, the risks of cascading failures would be completely different. Inspired by the analysis of intersubnetworks power shifts in cascading failures, inverse-community (IC) structure is proposed in TWN to intuitively identify the risk of cascading failures. IC describes a structure in weighted networks with several communities in which the weighted interaction between communities is significantly stronger than that within the same community. Furthermore, the conventional modularity is upgraded as inverse-modularity (IM) to quantify the characteristic of IC structure in power networks.

Identity authentication based on multi-modal biometric fusion has opened up a new field of development, which has higher technical requirements and better application performance than single biometric recognition and authentication system. As a dynamic feature, lip reading feature is not easy to imitate, and can be collected with face information at the same time, so it has high convenience. Fusion of lip reading and face information can improve the accuracy of the authentication system, at the same time, greatly enhance the anti-counterfeiting ability of the recognition system. In this paper, Linear Preserving Projection (LPP)is used to extract face features, and Projection Local Spatiotemporal Descriptor (PLSD)is used to extract lip reading features.

Passwordless authentication is more convenient because the password now is removed and replaced with something you have, and it cannot be forgotten.

The visual differences presented to the face have a significant effect on the recognition capabilities of the kinship systems. We argue that aggregating multiple visual knowledge can better describe the characteristics of the subject for precise kinship identification. Typically, the age-invariant features can represent more natural facial details. Such age-related transformations are essential for face recognition due to the biological effects of aging. However, the existing methods mainly focus on employing the single-view image features for kinship identification, while more meaningful visual properties such as race and age are directly ignored in the feature learning step. To this end, we propose a novel deep collaborative multi-modal learning (DCML) to integrate the underlying information presented in facial properties in an adaptive manner to strengthen the facial details for effective unsupervised kinship verification. Specifically, we construct a well-designed adaptive feature fusion mechanism, which can jointly leverage the complementary properties from different visual perspectives to produce composite features and draw greater attention to the most informative components of spatial feature maps. Particularly, an adaptive weighting strategy is developed based on a novel attention mechanism, which can enhance the dependencies between different properties by decreasing the information redundancy in channels in a self-adaptive manner. Moreover, we propose to use self-supervised learning to further explore the intrinsic semantics embedded in raw data and enrich the diversity of samples. As such, we could further improve the representation capabilities of kinship feature learning and mitigate the multiple variations from original visual images. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experimental evaluations conducted on four widely-used datasets show that our DCML method is always superior to some state-of-the-art kinship verification methods.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3098165","University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2018-00035-FST,MYRG2019-00086-FST); Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR(grant numbers:0034/2019/AMJ,0087/2020/A2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9490195","Kinship verification;information security;self-supervised learning","Feature extraction;Task analysis;Visualization;Supervised learning;Correlation;Collaboration;Semantics","computer vision;deep learning (artificial intelligence);face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;image fusion;security of data;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","information security;DCML;biological effects;unsupervised kinship verification;original visual images;self-supervised learning;self-adaptive manner;adaptive weighting strategy;spatial feature maps;composite features;visual perspectives;adaptive feature fusion mechanism;facial properties;meaningful visual properties;single-view image features;face recognition;age-related transformations;age-invariant features;multiple visual knowledge;recognition capabilities;computer vision;unsupervised kinship estimation;deep collaborative multimodal learning","","","","59","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the advent of wireless technologies, peer-to-peer communication, GSM networks, it is becoming more challenging to build systems to authenticate users more efficiently. Traditional methods of authenticating a user with passwords and PIN numbers only are slowly proving ineffective since these credentials are easy to guess and steal. This paper proposes a distributed multimodal authentication system as a solution for managing digital identity information on most wireless networks. The proposed system uses artificial intelligence methods and biometrics to improve the security and privacy of users and service providers in a transparent, reliable and efficient way. The system is implemented using a technique of information fusion to combine the user's credentials for optimum recognition and authentication.","","978-0-7695-2846-5","10.1109/AUSWIRELESS.2007.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299669","Credentials;Attributes;Digital Identity;Authentication;Authorization;Information Fusion","Authentication;Identity management systems;Mobile communication;Computer crime;Mobile handsets;Credit cards;Government;Organizational aspects;Internet;Costing","artificial intelligence;authorisation;biometrics (access control);fraud;Internet;message authentication;radio networks","multimodal credentials;digital identity management systems;identity fraud;online services;user identity information;Internet users;peer-to-peer communication;GSM networks;multimodal authentication system;artificial intelligence methods;biometrics;user privacy;service providers;information fusion","","1","1","22","IEEE","10 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

New architecture and designs are required for the in-vehicle systems to address these emerging concerns. Early design decisions have a large impact on the required functionalities as well as the quality attributes of these systems. Understanding the impact of design decisions on the system quality is crucial for successful system development. It is difficult to estimate the requirements for safety (at an early development stage) considering the innovation aspect of automated driving. These safety requirements have a considerable influence on project planning and development cost. Therefore, it is important for the industry to understand the decision points and their impact on system design. In this article, we share our experience on understanding the impact of early design decisions on safety requirements. We particularly discuss the impact of design decisions regarding the operational design domain on (functional) safety. We provide two automated driving systems as discussion cases and investigate the impact of the operational situation on the safety requirements such as safe state and degraded operating mode. We show how posting small constraints on the operational situation can result in simplification of the sensor and actuator requirements of these systems.","2472-9647","978-1-5386-8396-5","10.1109/SYSCON.2019.8836917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8836917","","Safety;Vehicles;Automation;Automotive engineering;Control systems;Planning;Task analysis","battery powered vehicles;mobile computing;road safety;traffic engineering computing","automated driving systems;safety requirements;actuator requirements;quality attributes;in-vehicle systems;system quality;decision points;system design;operational design domain;automated driving","","1","","17","IEEE","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cybersecurity has also been considered in such efforts as a contributor to these environmental issues. Nonetheless, most green security approaches focus on designing low-overhead encryption schemes and do not emphasize energy-efficient security from architectural and deployment viewpoints. This paper sheds light on the emerging paradigm of adaptive cybersecurity as one of the research directions to support sustainable computing in green IoT.

Risk-aware, real-time security constrained economic dispatch (RT-SCED) provides an efficient solution towards promptly, economically and robustly responding to the changes in the power system operating state. Despite different model-based methods have been developed to handle uncertainties, significant computation burden arise to incorporate $N$-1 contingency constraints with a higher temporal resolution in RT-SCED. Driven by similar computational challenges, risk evaluation is often overlooked in the current application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based data-driven methods in RT-SCED. This paper proposes a DRL-based risk-aware RT-SCED methodological framework by incorporating a novel data-driven risk evaluation model to foster efficient agent-environment interactions. The real-time dispatch policies are constructed with an improved twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient method. The policy network features a residual network architecture and incorporates an active power allocation mechanism to integrate empirical dispatch knowledge, preventing early termination and fostering more efficient learning behavior. Case studies validate the superior performance of the proposed method in risk-aware RT-SCED on cost efficiency, uncertainty adaptability and computational efficiency, through benchmarking against model-based and data-driven baseline methods.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2023.3288039","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52207082); International Cooperation and Exchange Programme of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52261145704); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20220842); Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Smart Grid Technology and Equipment, Southeast University(grant numbers:4216002201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10158041","Data-driven methods;deep reinforcement learning;knowledge-integrated learning;power system risk evaluation;real-time security constrained economic dispatch","Contingency management;Uncertainty;Reactive power;Costs;Real-time systems;Load shedding;Load modeling","","","","","","","IEEE","20 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Thus, the aim of this paper is to comparatively evaluate the robustness of multi-modal systems, in serial and parallel fusion modes, under spoofing attacks. In particular, we empirically investigate the vulnerability of serial and parallel fusion of face and fingerprint biometrics to real spoofing attacks. Our results show that multi-modal systems in both fusion modes are vulnerable to attacks against a single bio-metric trait.

This paper focuses on a robust controller design scheme for inverter-interfaced distributed generators considering various operating modes and loading conditions of microgrids. Especially, during the island mode, the voltage and system frequency can easily change due to instant power mismatch between distributed generators and loads in the microgrid.

Many counterfeits can be identified once installed, however even a tech-savvy user may struggle to detect them before installation as app icons and descriptions can be quite similar to the original app. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage the recent advances in deep learning methods to create image and text embeddings so that counterfeit apps can be efficiently identified when they are submitted to be published in app markets. We show that for the problem of counterfeit detection, a novel approach of combining content embeddings and style embeddings (given by the Gram matrix of CNN feature maps) outperforms the baseline methods for image similarity such as SIFT, SURF, LATCH, and various image hashing methods. We first evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two well-known datasets for evaluating image similarity methods and show that, content, style, and combined embeddings increase precision@k and recall@k by 10-15 percent and 12-25 percent, respectively when retrieving five nearest neighbours. Second specifically for the app counterfeit detection problem, combined content and style embeddings achieve 12 and 14 percent increase in precision@k and recall@k, respectively compared to the baseline methods. We also show that adding text embeddings further increases the performance by 5 and 6 percent in terms of precision@k and recall@k, respectively when $k$k is five. Third, we present an analysis of approximately 1.2 million apps from Google Play Store and identify a set of potential counterfeits for top-10,000 popular apps. Under a conservative assumption, we were able to find 2,040 potential counterfeits that contain malware in a set of 49,608 apps that showed high similarity to one of the top-10,000 popular apps in Google Play Store. We also find 1,565 potential counterfeits asking for at least five additional dangerous permissions than the original app and 1,407 potential counterfeits having at least five extra third party advertisement libraries.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2020.3007260","Google Faculty Rewards 2017; NSW Cyber Security Network; Next Generation Technologies Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9133509","Security;fraud detection;mobile apps;android security;convolutional neural networks","Google;Malware;Mobile computing;Birds;Cloning;Visualization;Crawlers","deep learning (artificial intelligence);invasive software;mobile computing","mobile counterfeit apps;Google Play Store;tech-savvy user;app icons;original app;deep learning;text embeddings;app markets;content embeddings;style embeddings;baseline methods;image hashing;image similarity;content style;app counterfeit detection problem;top-10 apps;popular apps;multimodal neural embeddings","","5","","85","IEEE","6 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These benefits of multi-modality with unimodal biometric based systems are obtained by fusing multiple biometric traits. In this paper, PaLMprint (PLM) and Finger-Knuckle-Print (FKP) modalities are combined to get the best of both worlds. They are recent and very important biometrics modalities due to there discriminatory power, robustness over time and there acceptability by users.

To build a robust model, we need to consider configuration-level specifications in addition to protocol specification. As Modbus/TCP is a simple protocol with handful function code(s) or commands for each communication channel, designing a specification-based approach is suitable for monitoring this communication.

Magnetic field sensors are important for building automated functions in production lines, intelligent transportation systems, security systems and so on. The orthogonal fluxgate mechanism provides miniaturized low-cost magnetic sensors which can be incorporated in a compact electronic systems. The author proposed a new operating mode, fundamental mode, for the orthogonal fluxgate in which greater linear response and higher sensitivity can be obtained with an as-cast amorphous wire core compared to the conventional orthogonal fluxgate mechanism where the second harmonic is a measure of applied magnetic field. When the magnetic anisotropy is present, however, in an amorphous wire at off circumferential direction, the offset may arise and the input-output response curve becomes asymmetric with respect to the origin. In this paper, a method is presented to solve this problem.","","0-7803-7365-0","10.1109/INTMAG.2002.1001442","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1001442","","Magnetic sensors;Intelligent sensors;Intelligent transportation systems;Amorphous materials;Wire;Magnetic field measurement;Sensor systems;Production systems;Intelligent structures;Security","magnetic sensors;fluxgate magnetometers;magnetic anisotropy;amorphous magnetic materials","symmetric response;orthogonal fluxgate;fundamental mode;magnetic field sensors;low-cost magnetic sensors;linear response;sensitivity;as-cast amorphous wire core;magnetic anisotropy;amorphous wire;input-output response curve","","1","","1","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These machines now affect the safety of humans as well as the security of personal data and consequently money transactions. To ensure the integrity of these systems' operating state, several fault detection mechanisms have been developed to safely correct or stop unforeseen execution behavior. Because of the rise of battery or even field-supplied systems these mechanisms often heavily decrease available power budgets or lead to significantly increased production costs. Therefore, this paper introduces novel micro-architectural execution signature characterization and handling techniques for system-on-chip designs providing power estimation hardware. Existing power sensor infrastructure is reused to enable efficient system-state monitoring using micro-architectural hashes to cover a wide range of implemented system functionality.

Biometric security becomes a positive solution, adopted for many identification problems in various sectors, including Aviation. As the avionics business keeps growing worldwide, air terminals face the difficulties of increasingly more passenger volumes; with that, travelers' desire for a secure and consistent pass through the airport terminals is just expanding. COVID-19 has managed a hit in all parts of our lives. Maintaining social distance and wearing masks are very important in maintaining a person's health in this pandemic situation. In this scenario, facial recognition for passenger identification is difficult and tends to false acceptance of passengers with identical faces. To address this issue, contactless biometric traits like iris and fingerprints are considered for security growth. The paper deals with the fusion of iris and fingerprint to identify passengers without removing the masks and promotes safe travel. The iris and fingerprint features are extracted using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM) and cross number technique. Maintaining these templates requires more space for storage. To make this simple, Sparse autoencoder, an unsupervised deep learning technique is incorporated on the fused template for attaining the dimensionality reduction. A minimum cost matcher(MCM) is employed to increase the multimodal biometric system's accuracy and performance. Thus, the proposed system honors passenger security builds confidence in air travel, and also strives for economic growth.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438214","","Dimensionality reduction;Deep learning;COVID-19;Pandemics;Face recognition;Fingerprint recognition;Retina","airports;avionics;biometrics (access control);deep learning (artificial intelligence);face recognition;feature extraction;fingerprint identification;image fusion;iris recognition;unsupervised learning","unsupervised deep learning;fused template;dimensionality reduction;multimodal biometric system;passenger security;air travel;sparse autoencoder;number technique;fingerprint features;safe travel;security growth;iris;contactless biometric traits;identical faces;passenger identification;facial recognition;pandemic situation;wearing masks;social distance;COVID-19;airport terminals;secure pass;travelers;passenger volumes;air terminals;avionics business;aviation;identification problems;biometric security;multimodal biometrics;dimensional reduction","","1","","34","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we use SDN paradigm combined with machine learning to leverage the benefits of programmable flow-based telemetry with flexible data-driven models to manage IoT devices based on their network activity. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We analyze traffic traces of 17 real consumer IoT devices collected in our lab over a six-month period and identify a set of traffic flows (per-device) whose time-series attributes computed at multiple timescales (from a minute to an hour) characterize the network behavior of various IoT device types, and their operating states (i.e., booting, actively interacted with user, or being idle); (2) We develop a multi-stage architecture of inference models that use flow-level attributes to automatically distinguish IoT devices from non-IoTs, classify individual types of IoT devices, and identify their states during normal operations. We train our models and validate their efficacy using real traffic traces; and (3) We quantify the trade-off between performance and cost of our solution, and demonstrate how our monitoring scheme can be used in operation for detecting behavioral changes (firmware upgrade or cyber attacks).","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.2971213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8981946","IoT;device monitoring;flow characteristics;machine learning","Monitoring;Telemetry;Performance evaluation;Object recognition;Machine learning;Cameras;Internet of Things","computer network security;firmware;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic;telemetry","nonIoTs;real traffic traces;IoT cyber-security;cyber-security risks;Internet of Things devices;network operators;network monitoring technologies;network switches;programmable flow-based telemetry;flexible data-driven models;network activity;traffic flows;network behavior;real consumer IoT devices;flow-level attributes;SDN paradigm;machine learning;time-series attributes;firmware upgrade;cyber attacks","","38","","57","IEEE","4 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although those results were obtained under a worst-case scenario when the attacker is able to replicate the exact appearance of the true biometric, this raises the issue of investigating more thoroughly the robustness of multi-modal systems against spoof attacks and devising new methods to design robust systems against them. To this aim, in this paper we propose a robustness evaluation method which takes into account also scenarios more realistic than the worst-case one. Our method is based on an analytical model of the score distribution of fake traits, which is assumed to lie between the one of genuine and impostor scores, and is parametrised by a measure of the relative distance to the distribution of impostor scores, we name “fake strength”. Varying the value of such parameter allows one to simulate the different factors which can affect the distribution of fake scores, like the ability of the attacker to replicate a certain biometric. Preliminary experimental results on real bi-modal biometric data sets made up of faces and fingerprints show that the widely used LLR rule can be highly vulnerable to spoof attacks against one only matcher, even when the attack has a low fake strength.","2153-0742","978-1-4577-0903-6","10.1109/CCST.2011.6095935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095935","","Robustness;Biometrics;Biological system modeling;Testing;System performance;Data models;Training data","biometrics (access control);security of data","robustness analysis;likelihood ratio score fusion rule;multimodal biometric system;spoof attack;spoofed biometric replica;robust system design;robustness evaluation method;fake trait score distribution;genuine score;impostor score;fake strength","","15","","16","IEEE","8 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is based upon the ever-secure Advanced Encryption Standard Cipher Block Chaining (AES-CBC) mode of encryption and Indexing-First One (IFO) hashing for the generation of the secret keys. The proposed system utilizes two biometrics of the user, the iris and the fingerprint, but instead of using the features of the biometrics directly, they are hashed through the IFO process to create a secret key that can be revoked and regenerated in case of a compromise ensuring the security of the users biometrics. The IFO hashes obtained from the biometric feature vectors are then used as two different secret keys in a two round AES-CBC system to encrypt the medical image. The medical image can be decrypted by performing the AES-CBC rounds in reverse with the correct keys, meaning that with high probability, only the correct user will be able to decrypt the image. This encryption technique improves upon many existing medical encryption schemes based on biometrics, which do not take the protection of the biometric template into account. We were able to perform one full key generation, encryption and decryption in.027 seconds. In addition, this processes is lossless, meaning that there is no change in the pixels of the medical image during the encryption or decryption process, which is necessary of a medical image encryption system.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377901","Arkansas Research Alliance; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377901","Encryption;Medical Images;Biometrics;Template Protection;Image security;AES-CBC","Image coding;Biometrics (access control);Big Data;Encryption;Standards;Biomedical imaging;Iris recognition","biometrics (access control);fingerprint identification;indexing;iris recognition;medical image processing;private key cryptography;vectors","IFO hashing;biometric feature vectors;secret keys;AES-CBC system;decryption process;medical image encryption system;cancelable multimodal biometric;medical encryption schemes;encryption process;advanced encryption standard cipher block chaining system;indexing first one hashing;fingerprint biometric;iris biometric","","2","","34","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the fluctuating renewable generation could lead to time-varying alternative gas injections. Then, the gas composition in the gas system may become uncertain, increasing the short-term risk of the integrated power-gas systems during the operation. This paper proposes a short-term reliability assessment approach for IPGS with alternative gas injections. First, the multi-performance and multi-state universal generating functions (UGF) are constructed to efficiently model the short-term reliability of the power-to-gas facility and the wind farm, respectively. Then, a reliability management UGF operator is proposed to minimize both load shedding and gas security violation. A set of novel reliability indices is proposed to comprehensively assess the gas security violations under uncertain gas compositions. Moreover, an analytical short-term reliability assessment approach is proposed, where the state-based sequential approximation and state-based McCormick envelope techniques are tailored and embedded. By optimizing the solution order by the system states, the nonconvexities in the reliability management optimization problem can be handled tractably without increasing the computation burden. Finally, the IEEE 24 bus Reliability Test System and the Belgium gas system are used to validate the proposed approach.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2023.3286821","Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China(grant numbers:BK20220261); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154141","integrated power and gas systems;gas composition;hydrogen;short-term reliability;renewable energy;power-to-gas","Hydrogen;Reliability;Methane;Production;Power system reliability;Renewable energy sources;Security","","","","2","","","IEEE","16 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

State estimation algorithms (SEAs) play a pivotal role in this domain by accurately furnishing the operating states of the grid. Lately a new genre of cyber attacks compromising the data integrity of the grid namely the false data injection attack (FDIA) has illustrated its detrimental consequences by efficiently evading the traditional bad data detection algorithm. Grid operators must ensure an efficient identification of such class of attacks residing in the measurement set, hence confirming a safe and reliable operation of the power sector. Identification of FDIA subsuming state forecasting policies can accurately capture the variations introduced in the set of estimated states due to an attack. This work advocates the implementation of a scalable neural network structure which showcases an effective forecasting policy of operational states, hence showcasing its potential to detect the presence of an attack in real-time. The recommended neural network structure with its optimum hyper-parameters promote a superior state forecasting stratagem with the least error in comparison to most of the modern state forecasting approaches.

Security operations and administration entail a wide breadth of tasks and functions, and the security professional is expected to have a working familiarity with each of them. This can include maintaining a secure environment for business functions and the physical security of a campus and, specifically, the data center. Throughout your career, you will likely have to oversee and participate in incident response activities, which will include conducting investigations, handling material that may be used as evidence in criminal prosecution and/or civil suits, and performing forensic analysis. The Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) should also be familiar with common tools for mitigating, detecting, and responding to threats and attacks; this includes knowledge of the importance and use of event logging as a means to enhance security efforts. Another facet the security practitioner may have to manage could be how the organization deals with emergencies, including disaster recovery. There is a common thread running through all aspects of this topic: supporting business functions by incorporating security policy and practices with normal daily activities. This involves maintaining an accurate and detailed asset inventory, tracking the security posture and readiness of information technology (IT) assets through the use of configuration/change management, and ensuring personnel are trained and given adequate support for their own safety and security.","","9781119601968","10.1002/9781119601951.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821765.pdf&bkn=9820841&pdfType=chapter","","Ethics;Codes;Security;Law;Organizations;Safety;Standards","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Intrusion detection performance depends on accuracy, which needs to improve to decrease false alarms and to increase the detection rate. To resolve concerns on performance, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM), and other techniques have been used in recent work. Such techniques indicate limitations and are not efficient for use in large data sets, such as system and network data. The intrusion detection system is used in analyzing huge traffic data; thus, an efficient classification technique is necessary to overcome the issue. This problem is considered in this paper. Well-known machine learning techniques, namely, SVM, random forest, and extreme learning machine (ELM) are applied. These techniques are well-known because of their capability in classification.

The increase of Internet-connected devices has caused attackers to focus their attention more on these devices. Therefore, new and more sophisticated attacks on IoT systems are discovered every day. Currently, to ensure reliability and operability, most IoT systems are designed to operate in a relatively static configuration in a highly heterogeneous environment. However, a system that does not continuously change its configurations, i.e., a static system, gives an advantage to attackers; with enough time and resources, an attacker will eventually find and exploit the vulnerabilities of any static target. This work proposes a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy that randomly shuffles the communication protocols through which a node communicates to a gateway in an IoT network. The system’s configuration changes have an associated cost. The objective of the proposed MTD strategy in this work is to balance the increase in system performance overhead, the increase in business impact (system unavailability), and, at the same time, the decrease in the probability of success of a given attack. A framework is proposed to design this strategy; this framework can guide any MTD strategy for IoT systems. The framework’s objective is to find, after several iterations, the MTD strategy parameters that achieve a balance between five different measurable variables of an IoT system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3107403","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT); Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN)(grant numbers:SIP-1999,SIP-20210039); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521488","Moving target defense;Internet of Things;cybersecurity;framework","Protocols;IP networks;Computer security;System performance;Internet of Things;Resilience;Performance evaluation","computer network security;Internet of Things;probability;protocols","moving target defense strategy;IoT network;IoT system;MTD strategy parameters;Internet of Things;Internet-connected devices","","4","","19","CCBY","24 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our analysis shows that it is possible to extract this information, essential for security monitoring, purely from the raw network traffic and without background knowledge provided by the control system engineers.

To our best knowledge, our construction is the first IBE scheme that simultaneously achieves efficient revocability, anonymity and full security in the exponent-inversion IBE family.","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8253992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8253992","","Identity-based encryption;Encryption;Standards;Adaptation models","cryptography;public key cryptography","deja Q Encore RIBE encryption;RIBE schemes;exponent-inversion IBE family;IBE scheme;adaptive-ID attack;Anonymous RIBE scheme;adaptive security;certificateless system;dynamic user management;anonymous revocable identity","","","","23","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Increasingly, critical decisions are being made using these AI systems in application domains such as employment, finance, and crime prevention. These applications are done through the use of more abstract concepts such as emotions, trait evaluations (e.g., trustworthiness), and behavior (e.g., deception). These abstract concepts are learned by the AI system using the verbal and non-verbal cues from the human subject stimuli (e,g., facial expressions, movements, audio, text) for inference. Because the use of AI systems often happens in high stakes scenarios, it is of utmost importance that the AI system participating in the decision-making process is highly reliable and credible. In this paper, we specifically consider the feasibility of using such an AI system for deception detection. We examine if deception can be caught using multimodal aspects such as facial expressions and movements, audio cues, video cues, etc. We experiment using three different datasets with varying degrees of deception to explore the problem of deception detection. We also study state-of-the-art deception detection systems and investigate whether we can extend their algorithm into new datasets. We conclude that there is a lack of reasonable evidence that AI-based deception detection is generalizable over different scenarios of lying (lying deliberately, lying under duress, and lying through half-truths) and that in the future additional factors will need to be considered to make such a claim.","","978-1-7281-8543-9","10.1109/TPS-ISA50397.2020.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9325368","deception detection;multi-modal data analysis;machine learning;ethics;facial expressions","Feature extraction;Artificial intelligence;Reliability;Measurement;Face recognition;Security;Government","artificial intelligence;decision making;face recognition;security of data;video signal processing","AI system;application domains;abstract concepts;AI-based deception detection;multimodal deception detection;artificial intelligence systems;video processing;face recognition;video cues;audio cues;facial expressions","","2","","39","IEEE","19 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose to overcome this issue by using anomaly detection on multi-modal images for traversability classification, which is easily scalable by training in a self-supervised fashion from robot experience. In this work, we evaluate multiple anomaly detection methods with a combination of uni- and multi-modal images in their performance on data from different environmental conditions. Our results show that an approach using a feature extractor and normalizing flow with an input of RGB, depth and surface normals performs best.

The detection policy involves a robust, nonlinear deep learning approach that is capable of not only forecasting the operating states of the grid, but also can be effectively deployed by the operator to determine any attacks within the raw measurements. It is seen that such scalable models working in real-time promote a robust performance under measurement noise as well.

In this work, we explore the combination of three modalities (RGB, depth and skeleton data) to design a robust multi-modal framework for vision-based human activity recognition. Especially, spatial information, body shape/posture and temporal evolution of actions are highlighted using illustrative representations obtained from a combination of dynamic RGB images, dynamic depth images and skeleton data representations. Therefore, each video is represented with three images that summarize the ongoing action. Our framework takes advantage of transfer learning from pre-trained models to extract significant features from these newly created images. Next, we fuse extracted features using Canonical Correlation Analysis and train a Long Short-Term Memory network to classify actions from visual descriptive images.

Various detection methods (e.g., lookup systems, fraud cue-based methods) have been proposed to identify phishing websites. The limitations of lookup systems (e.g., failing to address newly created attacks) and the fraud cue-based methods (e.g., relying on feature engineering) motivated the development of deep representation-based methods capable of learning deep fraud cues for enhanced anti-phishing capacity. Focusing mostly on URLs, these methods fail to analyze other two important modalities of website content: textual information and visual design. Moreover, the interpretability of these deep learning based methods is limited, reducing model trustworthiness and preventing relevant and actionable intelligence. As such, we propose a multi-modal hierarchical attention model (MMHAM) which jointly learns the deep fraud cues from the three major modalities of website content for phishing website detection. Specifically, MMHAM features an innovative shared dictionary learning approach for aligning representations from different modalities in the attention mechanism. In our evaluation experiments, the proposed MMHAM not only learned improved deep cues for enhanced phishing detection, but provided a hierarchical interpretability system from which we could develop phishing threat intelligence to inform phishing websites detection at different levels.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2021.3119323","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:91846201,71722010,72101079,72171071,91746302); Research Project of Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2019KE0AB04); Shanghai Data Exchange Cooperative Program(grant numbers:W2021JSZX0052); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568704","Antiphishing;machine learning;multimodal systems;security and protection","Phishing;Navigation;Visualization;Uniform resource locators;Deep learning;Protocols;Blacklisting","","","","2","","47","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The authors present the first general treatment of the coercion problem in secure computation. They first present a general definition of protocols that provide resilience to coercion. Their definition constitutes a natural extension of the general paradigm used for defining secure multiparty protocols. They next show that if trapdoor permutations exist then any function can be incoercibly computed (i.e., computed by a protocol that provides resilience to coercion) in the presence of computationally bounded adversaries and only public communication channels. This holds as long as less than half the parties are coerced (or corrupted). In particular, theirs are the first incoercible protocols without physical security assumptions. Also, the protocols constitute an alternative solution to the recently solved adaptive security problem. Their techniques are quite surprising and include non-standard use of deniable encryptions.","0272-5428","0-8186-7594-2","10.1109/SFCS.1996.548509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=548509","","Protocols;Communication channels;Resilience;Voting;Radio access networks;Cryptography;Privacy;Data security;Communication system control;Computer science","protocols","incoercible multiparty computation;secure multiparty protocols;coercion resilience;trapdoor permutations;computationally bounded adversaries;public communication channels;adaptive security problem;deniable encryptions","","22","","23","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The existing formal-based approaches for enforcing security policies are mainly expressed using first-order logic. A major drawback of using first-order logic in implementing dynamic policies is that new observations cannot override previously inferred consequences. In fact, a security system whose enterprise policies are implemented using first-order logic is required to have complete access to data in advance in order to be able to perform an informed reasoning and enforce restricting policies. As a major problem, the systems designed based on these first order logic-based approaches are often static, inflexible, and hard to manage and scale. This paper introduces an approach for expressing and enforcing adaptive access control policies dynamically. The paper presents a non-monotonic formal approach based on Answer Set Programming where default policies are explicitly separated from context-dependent and exception policies that often occur in dynamic systems and in particular when the required context data are unavailable ahead of time. The results of presented case study demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed approach compared to the first order logic-based context-sensitive approaches as implemented in Organizational-Based Access Control (ORBAC) model.","0730-3157","978-1-4673-8845-0","10.1109/COMPSAC.2016.45","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552052","Access Control;Formal Analysis;Adaptive Security Policies;Management;Answer Set Programming","Context;Access control;Cognition;Concrete;Organizations;Programming","authorisation;inference mechanisms;logic programming","adaptive reasoning;context-sensitive access controls;security policy-based management systems;first-order logic;enterprise policies;enforce restricting policies;adaptive access control policies;nonmonotonic formal approach;answer set programming;context-dependent policies;exception policies;organizational-based access control model;ORBAC model","","2","","11","IEEE","25 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the mechanical design and locomotion strategies of current drones limit the size of the confined space that can be explored. In this work, we present a quadcopter capable of traversing long passageways 34% smaller than its nominal size. The combination of a soft morphing frame and multi-modal mobility allows the drone to exploit a new dynamic strategy for passageway traversal. The drone flies at a given speed towards the entrance of the passageway until it collides with it. The momentum and ability of the frame to soften allow the drone to passively fold and enter. Once the drone is squeezed between the walls of the passageway, it uses two tracks to crawl through. Through experiments, we characterize the main mechanical systems of the drone and study the entry into crevices of different sizes.","2475-8426","978-1-6654-1764-8","10.1109/SSRR53300.2021.9597683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9597683","","Space exploration;Safety;Security;Mechanical systems;Robots;Drones","autonomous aerial vehicles;disasters;helicopters;mobile robots","soft drone;multimodal mobility;confined space;post-disaster scenarios;long passageways;narrow passageways;remote exploration;mechanical design;locomotion strategies;current drones;soft morphing frame;passageway traversal","","1","","19","IEEE","16 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is used to store, track, and analyze traffic that belongs to Virtual Networks (VNETs), Virtual Machines (VMs), or Network Interfaces (NICs). It is used for logging ingress and egress IP traffic flows, number of bytes and packets transmitted and received, and network connections. Flow logging is critical for the investigation of firewall functionalities, security incidents, and threat detection. Moreover, it can be used for detecting connection and network anomalies such as connection outages, configuration changes, or malicious activities. Alerts can be fired for any suspicious network activities. Visualization of flows logs provides insights such as who is using a web-service or an application, when customers are logged in and out, and what are the geographical locations where connections are being initiated or terminated. In this paper, a novel method for VNF that details the framework for logging network flows in a Cloud environment is provided. The method aims at accommodating multiple and simulations Cloud tenants and enabling the logging of network flows while at the same time accommodates high incoming rates of flow events and data. One of the major benefits of this new method is that it supports high number of flows per second that facilitates flow logging of high traffic volumes. Not only customers can experience higher number of flows logged, but the flow logs are visualized and contain the number of packets and bytes transmitted and received for outbound and inbound flows, respectively.","","978-1-5386-7693-6","10.1109/UEMCON.2018.8796641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8796641","Cloud;Distributed System;flow logging;virtualization;SDN;VNF","","cloud computing;computer network security;Internet;IP networks;network interfaces;telecommunication traffic;virtual machines;virtualisation","flow events;facilitates flow logging;high traffic volumes;flow logs;outbound;inbound;viewing;VNF;logging ingress;network connections;firewall functionalities;threat detection;detecting connection;connection outages;suspicious network activities;cloud environment;network analysis;virtualized network function;virtual networks;virtual machines;network interfaces;multiple simulations cloud tenants;advanced network flow logging;Microsoft azure distributed system","","1","","22","IEEE","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the existing IBHS schemes, which either handle only linear functions or has a large public key parameter and satisfies only the artificial notion of selective security. In this work, we construct the first leveled adaptively secure identity-based fully homomorphic signature (IBFHS) schemes without additional public parameters, which can be used to sign many different datasets. Thereby positively answering the open question of constructing a leveled IBFHS scheme with short public parameters, proposed by Wang et al., (ISC, 2015, Springer). We achieve the stronger security and better parameters by using the trapdoor vanishing and vector encoding technique. In our scheme, the size of every evaluated signature depends only logarithmically on the size of the input dataset, and the complexity of verifying a signature for a computation can be amortized when verifying the same computation on many different datasets.

In order to offer person-specific services for/of specific person a pre-identifying step should be done in the run-up. Using biometric in such application is encountered by diverse challenges. First, using one trait and excluding the others depends on the application aimed to. Some applications demand directly touch to biometric sensors, while others don't. Second challenge is the reliability of used biometric arrangement. Civilized application demands lower reliability comparing to the forensics ones. And third, for biometric system could only one trait be used (uni-modal systems) or multiple traits (Bi-or Multi-modal systems). The latter is applied, when systems with a relative high reliability are expected. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive view about biometric and its application. The above mentioned challenges will be analyzed deeply. The suitability of each biometric sensor according to the aimed application will be deeply discussed.

Selection methods are typically based on the principle of identifying the effect of contingencies on multiple normalized performance indices and ranking them using the results. Presently used performance indices are highly nonlinear and they are known to mask the effects of single contingencies leading to misclassifications. In this paper, we propose two new methods, one relying on margin-based performance indices and another based on state sensitivity. New performance indices are proposed based on margins of 1) circuit loading, 2) bus voltages, and 3) reactive power. In addition, a state sensitivity method is proposed which estimates a system's post contingency operating state via a single iteration of the quadratized power flow model and provides estimates of post contingency line loading, bus voltages, and reactive power levels. Numerical experiments on a three phase version of the IEEE Reliability Test System show that the proposed performance indices yield more accurate results, at a computational cost comparable to a single power flow iteration. The state sensitivity method is more accurate in identifying critical contingencies but its computational cost is higher. The method has been also demonstrated in the larger PEGASE systems.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2555987","Power Systems Engineering Research Center (PSERC); National Science Foundation; Onassis Foundation; PSERC and the Onassis Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457673","Contingency selection;online security analysis;unbalanced networks","Mathematical model;Security;Load flow;Indexes;Performance analysis;Sensitivity;Jacobian matrices","load flow;power engineering computing;power system reliability","fast online contingency selection;margin-based framework;unbalanced power systems is;circuit loading;bus voltages;reactive power;IEEE reliability test system;single power flow iteration","","5","","28","IEEE","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we show that malicious responses from a remote node can lead to reduced privacy for the client. We discuss several lightweight mitigations that reduce the attack's effectiveness. To fully eliminate this class of attack, we also show how to augment Monero's blockchain data structure with an additional index that clients can use to authenticate responses from remote nodes.

Because the echo features depend on 3D facial geometries and material, our multi-modal design is not easily spoofed by images or videos like image based face recognition systems.

For this we need the proof of their safety, medical efficacy and economic efficiency. Aside of obligatory clinical trials we need an extensive system of post-market surveillance, because: a medical device is a part of a complex cyber-physical system, with humans in the loop / the environment cannot be sufficiently defined / humans react differently to the therapy, they also behave differently / after every software upgrade the device is not the same as before In their operation such devices generate huge amounts of data that can be reused for such analysis. Technically oriented people believe it can be done using a Big Data Analytics system without a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. It is doubtful if such approach can deliver useful results.

Following the IEEE Standard 1547.4-2011, the operation and control of large distribution networks can be enhanced by dividing these networks into multiple virtual microgrids. The proposed planning framework incorporates the necessary conditions for microgrids to operate efficiently in grid-connected operating mode and successfully during islanding. To obtain a robust design, the clustering process considers three objectives: maximizing the self-adequacy of the designed microgrids, maximizing microgrid islanding success probability, and a combination of both targets. For this purpose, the PG&E distribution system with 69 buses is selected as a test case. Backtracking search optimization algorithm, a probabilistic load flow approach, and graph-based theories are used to accomplish this research. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the self-adequacy and the islanding success probability objectives in the clustering process. Compared with other strategies present in the previous literature, the proposed framework results in more self-sufficient and successful islands assessed in terms of active and reactive power adequacy as well as voltage constraints. Next, the effects of increased penetration level of DGs and installation of both distributed energy-storage units and distributed reactive sources on the design process are examined.

It also supports a broadcaster to deliver the personalized messages to the individual authorized users simultaneously. However, none of the existing BEPM schemes consider the anonymity of authorized users, which is a crucial security requirement for many BEPM application scenarios. Besides, the previous studies on BEPM only achieve security against chosen-plaintext attack adversaries. Certificate-based cryptosystem gives a viable way to construct more secure and efficient BEPM schemes. We propose the new concept of anonymous certificate-based broadcast encryption with personalized messages (ANON-CBBE-PM). Subsequently, we illustrate the formal definition and the security model of ANON-CBBE-PM. Furthermore, we present an ANON-CBBE-PM scheme, which solves key escrow problem in identity-based cryptosystem and certificate management problem in traditional public key cryptosystem. Compared with the existing BEPM schemes, the proposed scheme not only protects the privacy of authorized users, but also has advantage in performance. To be more specific, the lengths of the user secret key and the system public parameters, as well as the cost for decryption are constant. For those BEPM applications with a multitude of users whose computing ability is limited, the proposed scheme is more practical. In addition, our scheme simultaneously achieves anonymity and confidentiality under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack in the standard model.","1557-9611","","10.1109/TBC.2020.2984974","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972095,U1736112,61772009,61672207); Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:BK20161511); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2016B10114); Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Security & Intelligent Processing, NJUPT, and the Project of Scientific Research Innovation for College Graduate Student of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:KYZZ15_0151); Transverse Research Project of Huaiyin Institute of Technology(grant numbers:Z421A19815); Doctoral Scientific Research Starting Foundation of Huaiyin Institute of Technology(grant numbers:Z301B19563); Open Project of Jiangsu Internet of Things Mobile Internet Technology Engineering Laboratory(grant numbers:JSWLW-2017-007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9078860","Broadcast encryption;anonymity;chosen-ciphertext attack;standard model;adaptive security","Encryption;Adaptation models;Public key cryptography;Standards","authorisation;broadcast communication;data privacy;message authentication;private key cryptography;public key cryptography","adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack;system public parameters;traditional public key cryptosystem;key escrow problem;security model;formal definition;ANON-CBBE-PM;chosen-plaintext attack adversaries;encrypted broadcast message;cryptographic primitive;BEPM;user secret key;certificate management problem;identity-based cryptosystem;personalized messages;anonymous certificate-based broadcast encryption","","24","","54","IEEE","27 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we have formulated two novel distributed localization and tracking schemes, based on Gradient Descent and Extended Kalman Filter algorithms, to cope with erroneous GPS location. Sensor-rich vehicles exploit Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications and a multitude of integrated sensors, like LIDAR and Cameras, to generate and fuse heterogeneous data. Each vehicle interacts only with its own connected neighboring vehicles, formulating individual star topologies. Extensive simulation studies using CARLA autonomous driving simulator, verify the significant reduction of GPS error achieved by the two methods in various experimental conditions. Distributed tracking proves to be much superior than Gradient descent algorithm, both in the case of self (58% reduction of GPS error) and neighboring vehicles location estimation (38% reduction of average GPS error).","","978-1-6654-4511-5","10.1109/SmartIoT52359.2021.00070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9556210","Autonomous driving;Cooperative Awareness;Localization and Tracking;5G","Location awareness;Smart cities;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Transportation;Sensor fusion;Topology;Sensors","Global Positioning System;image sequences;Kalman filters;mobile robots;road vehicles;sensor fusion;traffic engineering computing;vehicles;wireless sensor networks","connected automated vehicles;smart cities;security;transportation systems;involved vehicles;novel distributed localization;tracking schemes;Extended Kalman Filter algorithms;erroneous GPS location;sensor-rich vehicles;Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications;integrated sensors;connected neighboring vehicles;extensive simulation studies;CARLA autonomous driving simulator;distributed tracking;Gradient descent algorithm;vehicles location estimation;average GPS error;multimodal","","7","","15","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To defend against APT attacks, organizations should sufficiently understand these attacks based on the attack elements and their relations and actively defend against these attacks in multiple dimensions. Most organizations perform risk management to manage their information security. Generally, they use the information system risk assessment (ISRA). However, the method has difficulties supporting sufficiently analyzing security risks and actively responding to these attacks due to the limitations of asset-driven qualitative evaluation activities.

Before deploying traditional CP-ABE in real mHealth applications, there are three concerns worth considering. First, the scale of pre-defined attribute universe is lack of scalability. Second, the plaintext access policy sent along with the ciphertext would leak the PHR owner’s privacy. Third, it is difficult to identify the malicious user who intentionally disclosed his (partial or modified) private key. In this paper, we present HTAC, a fine-grained policy-hiding and traceable access control scheme for mHealth. In HTAC, the attribute universe is exponentially large and unbounded. Each attribute is expressed by an attribute name and an attribute value. In the encryption phase, the value is hidden in the ciphertext and only the generic attribute name is exposed. The malicious user will be precisely identified by searching the identity linked with the suspicious private key in an identity table. We further extend HTAC by removing the identity table and assigning more explicitly responsibility for the authority and the trace center. Then the storage overhead of tracing the malicious users is constant. The security analysis and performance comparison indicate that HTAC and the extended scheme are secure and practicable for real mHealth.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3004897","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFC1314903); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872088,61941116,61502248); Major Science Research Project of Jiangsu Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:19KJA310010); National Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2019J01276); Innovation Capability Support Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2020KJXX-052); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2019KW-053,2020ZDLGY08-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9133097","Large universe;partially hidden access policy;traceable CP-ABE;adaptive security","Access control;Medical services;Encryption;Indexes;Systems architecture","authorisation;data privacy;electronic health records;health care;mobile computing;private key cryptography","private key;identity table;HTAC;ciphertext policy attribute based encryption;CP-ABE;mobile healthcare systems;mHealth;plaintext access policy;traceable access control;policy-hiding;personal health record privacy","","14","","44","CCBY","3 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, erroneous camera registrations due to noisy motor encoder readings, a faulty kinematic model or other error sources can drastically reduce the model quality. Most existing approaches register the pose of a free-floating single camera without considering constraints by the kinematic robot configuration. In contrast, ARM-SLAM [1] performs dense localization and mapping in the configuration space of the robot arm, implicitly tracking the pose of a single camera and creating a volumetric model. However, using a single camera only allows to cover a small field of view and can only constrain up to six degrees of freedom. Therefore, we propose the Multi-Cam ARM-SLAM (MC-ARM-SLAM) framework, which fuses information of multiple depth cameras mounted on the robot into a joint model. The use of multiple cameras allows to also estimate the motion of the robot base that is modeled as a virtual kinematic chain additionally to the motion of the arm. Furthermore, we use a robust bivariate error formulation, which helps to boost the accuracy of the method and mitigates the influence of outliers. The proposed method is extensively evaluated in simulation and on a real rescue robot. It is shown that the method is able to correct errors in the motor encoders and the kinematic model and outperforms the base version of ARM-SLAM.","2475-8426","978-1-6654-5680-7","10.1109/SSRR56537.2022.10018752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018752","","Robot vision systems;Kinematics;Cameras;Manipulators;Safety;Registers;Security","cameras;dexterous manipulators;image reconstruction;image registration;image sensors;manipulator kinematics;mobile robots;path planning;robot vision;SLAM (robots)","camera registrations;faulty kinematic model;kinematic robot configuration;MC-ARM-SLAM;model quality;multicam ARM-SLAM framework;multiple depth cameras;noisy motor encoder readings;registered depth images;rescue robot;robot arm;robot base;robust multimodal state estimation;truncated signed distance functions;volumetric model","","","","19","IEEE","24 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work considers the lifetime estimation of an IOT based sensor-actuator system controlling LED luminaire and window blinds based on ultra-low power processors and nano timer in an office lighting scenario.

However, CC integration with IoT allows an extraordinary capability and boosts economies’ ability to develop at a fast pace. Meanwhile, due to the rapid expansion of IoT, the current cloud network cannot keep abreast of the growing data loads and processing extremities, particularly in real-time. Even the most cutting-edge cloud providers are experiencing an inordinate strain as a result of the growing number of consumer and corporate devices connected to the IoT. While it has a centralized design, it lacks bandwidth and has downtime issues. High latency, lack of location awareness, outage concerns, etc., are among the issues that cloud services for IoT confront. Furthermore, due to uninterrupted operating states, the massive volume of data created by the IoT is increasing enormously. IoT devices are creating a flood of data, disrupting predictable data processing and analytics capabilities well managed by the cloud. As a result, securing this ocean of data has become an elite concern for researchers and cyber experts, as organizations jeopardize their reputation and users’ privacy and security.

However, this opens up the threat of theft of Intellectual Property (IP) since the system configuration is stored in easy-to-access Flash memory. To prevent this, high-end FPGAs have already been extended with symmetric-key decryption engines used to load an encrypted version of the configuration that cannot simply be copied and used without knowledge of the secret key. However, such protection systems based on straightforward use of symmetric cryptography are not well-suited with respect to business and licensing processes, since they are lacking a convenient scheme for key transport and installation. We propose a new protection scheme for the IP of circuits in configuration bit files that provides a significant improvement to the current unsatisfying situation. It uses both public-key and symmetric cryptography, but does not burden FPGAs with the usual overhead of public-key cryptography: While it needs hard-wired symmetric cryptography, the public-key functionality is moved into a temporary configuration bit stream for a one-time setup procedure. This approach requires only very few modifications to current FPGA technology. Using five basic stages, the new protection scheme allows new accounting models for volume licensing of IP, with automated key installation on FPGAs taking place at the customer's site.","","978-1-4244-1471-0","10.1109/FPT.2007.4439246","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4439246","IP protection;secure configuration;FPGA;embedded security","Intellectual property;Protection;Field programmable gate arrays;Cryptography;Security;Hardware;Licenses;Circuits;Public key;Very large scale integration","field programmable gate arrays;flash memories;logic design;reconfigurable architectures;SRAM chips","intellectual property protection;reconfigurable devices;SRAM;field programmable gate arrays;FPGA;flash memory;symmetric-key decryption engines;public-key cryptography;hard-wired symmetric cryptography;secure configuration;embedded security","","30","1","25","IEEE","22 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is no effective, low-cost solution to robustly and reliably detect and identify small, low-flying airborne vehicles such as fixed-wing aircraft or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that might be carrying out chemical, biological or nuclear attacks, or smuggling drugs or illegal immigrants across the border. This paper presents a low-cost and low-power methodology for performing key 24/7 sentry functions that can be used for the protection and the surveillance of critical infrastructure from airborne threats. The methodology is based on joint multi-sensor fusion technology. It consists of a forward-based fence comprised of a mixture of selected low cost, low power, netted sensors including a simple radar, acoustic microphone array and optical (infrared and visible) cameras to detect, track and discriminate potential airborne targets. An experimental prototype end-to-end proof of concept system with deploy able software, hardware and connectivity is built using COTS component. Multi-modal senor fusion algorithms employing Kalman filter for target tracking and acoustic and image recognition algorithm for target classification are implemented.

In this work, we investigate multimodal video forgery attack detection methods using both visual and wireless modalities. Since wireless signal-based human perception is environmentally sensitive, we propose a self-supervised training strategy to enable the system to work without external annotation and thus adapt to different environments.

Moreover, the techniques we describe can be applied not only separately, but can also be combined into coordinated attack graph views. We apply improved visual clustering to previously described network protection domains (attack graph cliques), which reduces graph complexity and makes the overall attack flow easier to understand. We also visualize the attack graph adjacency matrix, which shows patterns of network attack while avoiding the clutter usually associated with drawing large graphs. We show how the attack graph adjacency matrix concisely conveys the impact of network configuration changes on attack graphs. We also describe a novel attack graph filtering technique based on the interactive navigation of a hierarchy of attack graph constraints.

This is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation (GA). Robust and resilient detection, identification, localization, and tracking of sUAS sharing UAM airspace is complicated by urban factors such as non-transmitting, non-cooperative drones. Exacerbating these challenges, current technological limitations and vulnerabilities in Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can pose safety and security threats. To streamline a vision of safe and secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace, we propose Drone Net, a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) network of multi-modal ground and flight instruments. Drone Net is an architecture fusing a network of passive visual and acoustic sensor nodes with active Radio Detection and Ranging (radar) and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensing methods for UTM, designed for integration with existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and future UAM systems. The purpose of the Drone Net system is to evaluate use of Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic arrays networked within an urban UAS operating region such as uncontrolled Class-G and waiver-granted Class-D airspace. The Drone Net approach combines detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADS-B, and EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe, fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network. Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS that are both compliant and non-compliant alongside GA and UAM more safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more advanced scenarios between multiple UAS. The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time for analysis and security applications. More concrete applications for Drone Net include UTM integration with ATC and UAM, but also airspace safety and security for campus and public venues in general. Herein, we will present our experimental design and current test data from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in collaboration with University of Colorado Boulder toward completing the open specification for ground and flight instruments. We would additionally like to invite others to participate in growing the network and the data available for UTM, UAM, and GA shared airspace research.","2155-7209","978-1-7281-0649-6","10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9081710","fail-safe;fail-secure;UAS;UTM;UAM;GPS;ADS-B","","aerospace computing;air traffic control;aircraft navigation;autonomous aerial vehicles;cloud computing;control engineering computing;data mining;Global Positioning System;inertial navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;sensor fusion","inertial navigation systems;security threats;safe sUAS-UAM shared airspace;secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace;passive visual sensor nodes;acoustic sensor nodes;air traffic control;acoustic arrays;urban UAS operating region;Class-D airspace;Drone Net approach;ground radar;Drone Net network;fail-secure property;ground sensor network;ground-system sensor fusion;UTM flight plan;fail-secure methods;multiple UAS;regional cloud-based networks;multisensor drone detection;Drone Net project;global cloud-based networks;UAS traffic management network;fail-safe experiments;ADS-B;GPS;Global Positioning System;UAM airspace;UAM vehicles;heterogeneous drone shapes;innovative aviation designs;air taxi service;urban air mobility;unmanned aerial systems;urban airspace;UAM traffic;fail-secure experiments;flight instruments;airspace safety;flight sensor network","","7","","43","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the openness and mobility of wireless sensor technologies make the sensor-controller communication vulnerable to be eavesdropped and linked to the sensors in transmission of patient's information. Furthermore, in such resource-constrained environment, authenticating sensor nodes anonymously with the controller node while considering their limited capabilities is a paramount security requirement. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and adaptive anonymous authentication and key agreement scheme for the two-tier WBAN. The proposed protocol enables an anonymous mutual authentication and a session key establishment between the controller node and the body sensor nodes while taking into account the dynamic context changes. From a security perspective, we demonstrate that the proposed key agreement scheme achieves the desired security properties such as anonymity, unlinkability, perfect forward secrecy, etc. Performance analysis proves that the proposed protocol outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of communication and computational overhead.","2376-6506","978-1-5386-2070-0","10.1109/IWCMC.2018.8450288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8450288","WBAN;Anonymous Authentication;Adaptive security;Key agreement;Scyther","Relays;Authentication;Wireless communication;Body area networks;Wireless sensor networks;Protocols","body area networks;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;health care;next generation networks;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor networks","anonymous mutual authentication;body sensor nodes;key agreement scheme;adaptive anonymous authentication;wearable sensors;wireless body area networks;wireless sensor technologies;sensor-controller communication;lightweight authentication;WBAN;next generation ubiquitous healthcare systems","","3","","19","IEEE","30 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, to the best of our knowledge, the adversarial robustness of AVASD models hasn't been investigated, not to mention the effective defense against such attacks. In this paper, we are the first to reveal the vulnerability of AVASD models under audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual adversarial attacks through extensive experiments. What's more, we also propose a novel audio-visual interaction loss (AVIL) for making attackers difficult to find feasible adversarial examples under an allocated attack budget. The loss aims at pushing the inter-class embeddings to be dispersed, namely non-speech and speech clusters, sufficiently disentangled, and pulling the intra-class embeddings as close as possible to keep them compact. Experimental results show the AVIL outperforms the adversarial training by 33.14 mAP (%) under multi-modal attacks.","","979-8-3503-9690-4","10.1109/SLT54892.2023.10022646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10022646","Audio-visual active speaker detection;multi-modal adversarial attack;adversarial robustness","Training;Conferences;Closed box;Robustness;Glass box","audio-visual systems;object detection;security of data;speaker recognition","adversarial robustness;adversarial training;allocated attack budget;audio-visual active speaker detection;audio-visual adversarial attacks;audio-visual interaction loss;AVASD models;AVIL;feasible adversarial examples;multimodal attacks;push-pull","","","","54","IEEE","27 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it has been extensively recognized that the IoT-enabled communication network of power systems is vulnerable to cyberattacks. In particular, system operating states, critical attributes that act as input to the data-driven stability assessment, can be manipulated by malicious actors to mislead the system operator into making disastrous decisions and thus cause major blackouts and cascading events. In this paper, we explore the vulnerability of the data-driven power system stability assessment, with a special emphasis on decision tree-based stability assessment (DTSA) approaches, and investigate the feasibility of constructing a physics-constrained adversarial attack (PCAA) to undermine the DTSA. The PCAA is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem considering the misclassification constraint, power limits, and bad data detection, computing potential adversarial perturbations that reverse the “stable/unstable” prediction of the real-time input while remaining invisible/stealthy. Extensive experiments based on the IEEE 68-bus system are conducted to evaluate the impact of PCAAs on predictions of DTSA and their transferability.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3264492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10100624","Cyber Security;Transient Stability Assessment;Decision Trees;Physics-Constrained Machine Learning;Adversarial Examples","Power system stability;Stability criteria;Power measurement;Perturbation methods;Voltage measurement;Phasor measurement units;Transmission line measurements","","","","","","","IEEE","11 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We describe and analyze the scenarios of generator loss-of-field occurring two times at a cogeneration thermal power plant in Taiwan in the years 2003 and 2005. Since the total production loss from both events was quite large, some improvements have been implemented to prevent the recurrence of similar events in the future. They consist of installing the sequence of events recorder at the generator output terminal, regulating the generator lagging power factor operation from 0.95-0.99 to 0.91, adjusting the tap position to decrease the secondary voltage of the 161 kV/161 kV interconnecting transformer, operating the phase-leading capacitors attached with a multi-stage chain cut-off control unit, and running two or three generators in automatic voltage regulation mode instead of automatic power factor regulation mode. Although similar events occurred twice at the same power plant in 2006, the generating units were capable of continuous stable operation which had effectively verified the improvements of operational changes. In conclusion, we suggest that the operating modes of generators in a cogeneration plant should reexamine constantly as well as monitor power quality of different end-user sectors continuously in order to ensure the security of power-system operation.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2105894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5712191","Automatic power factor regulation;automatic voltage regulation;cogeneration power plant;generator loss-of-field","Generators;Reactive power;Cogeneration;Automatic voltage control;Capacitors;Power quality","cogeneration;power capacitors;power supply quality;power system security;power transformers;synchronous generators;thermal power stations","cogeneration thermal power plant;Taiwan;synchronous machine stability events;generator loss-of-field;production loss;event recorder;generator lagging power factor operation;interconnecting transformer;phase-leading capacitors;multistage chain cut-off control unit;automatic voltage regulation mode;automatic power factor regulation mode;continuous stable operation;power quality monitoring;power system operation security","","14","","7","IEEE","14 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we carry out a detailed benchmark of various widely used CNN architectures and visual representations on a popular dataset, namely the MIVIA Audio Events database. Our analysis is aimed at understanding how these factors affect the sound event recognition performance with a particular focus on the false positive rate, very relevant in audio surveillance solutions. In fact, although most of the proposed solutions achieve a high recognition rate, the capability of distinguishing the events-of-interest from the background is often not yet sufficient for real systems, and prevent its usage in real applications.

However, security aspects are a major concern for IoT devices due to their applications and the amount of sensitive data they provide. Simultaneously, the energy constraint in IoT networks remains a significant issue due to their limited resources. To reduce their energy consumption, several IoT protocols have integrated the energy-saving mode which offers four operating modes. On the basis of these four states, we derive an analysis framework, named HARPAGON, allowing an attacker to maximize his attack efficiency and minimize his impact in terms of energy consumption. Indeed, the effectiveness of many attacks depends principally on the state of the attacker and the victim at the same time. HARPAGON with the help of Markov chain theory allows modeling the interaction between the attacker and its victims. In this article, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework coupled with a jamming attack by comparing it to other types of jamming attacks. Experimental results reveal HARPAGON combined with a jamming attack drastically reduces the performance of the network, with an impact on the packet error rate (PER), which is around 13% higher than the reactive attack and with a reduced energy budget in respect of the other two well-known “green” jamming attacks.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3172849","Grant from CPER DATA; General Armament Direction, France; Defense Innovation Agency, France; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9769761","Energy effective;green attacks;Internet of Things (IoT);Markov chain theory;wireless networks","Jamming;Transmitters;Protocols;Internet of Things;Energy consumption;Wireless communication;Security","computer network management;computer network security;energy conservation;energy consumption;energy management systems;Internet of Things;jamming;Markov processes;protocols;telecommunication power management","Markov chain theory;packet error rate;PER;green jamming attack efficiency;energy consumption constraint;HARPAGON;reactive attack efficiency;energy-saving mode;IoT protocols;IoT device networks;energy management framework;reduced energy budget","","","","20","IEEE","5 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A popular approach for performing high‐level evaluation includes threat modeling, which provides opportunities for future scenario and Course of Action (COA) use cases. The ARMOUR Framework provides example technical and operational scenarios with the aim of supporting an overall cyber framework. Protective cyber scenarios take a variety of forms. Proactive scenarios are used to evaluate how the network responds to anomalies, or time to detect anomalous devices and configuration changes. Reactive scenarios, on the other hand, often training focused, and are used to perform standard Disaster Recovery/Continuity of Operations (DR/COOP) enterprise evaluations. Technical scenarios primarily deal with network anomalies. Cyber Operational Architecture Training System (COATS) explores methods for using modeling & simulation (M&S) to support training.","","9781119420811","10.1002/9781119420842.ch4","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821028.pdf&bkn=9820806&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Training;Soft sensors;Object recognition;Analytical models;Risk management;NIST","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The key observations that enable us to discover this sidechannel are: 1) in an effort to manage and minimize power consumption, modern microprocessors have a number of possible operating modes (power states) in which various sub-systems of the processor are powered down, 2) for some of the transitions between power states, the processor also changes the operating mode of the voltage regulator module (VRM) that supplies power to the affected sub-system, and 3) the electromagnetic (EM) emanations from the VRM are heavily dependent on its operating mode. As a result, these state-dependent EM emanations create a side-channel which can potentially reveal sensitive information about the current state of the processor and, more importantly, the programs currently being executed. To demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting this vulnerability, we create a covert channel by utilizing the changes in the processor's power states. We show how such a covert channel can be leveraged to exfiltrate sensitive information from a secured and completely isolated (air-gapped) laptop system by placing a compact, inexpensive receiver in proximity to that system. To further show the severity of this attack, we also demonstrate how such a covert channel can be established when the target and the receiver are several meters away from each other, including scenarios where the receiver and the target are separated by a wall. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed covert channel has >3x higher bit-rate. Finally, to demonstrate that this new vulnerability is not limited to being used as a covert channel, we demonstrate how it can be used for attacks such as keystroke logging.","2378-203X","978-1-7281-6149-5","10.1109/HPCA47549.2020.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9065580","Side-Channel;Microarchitecture Vulnerability;DVFS;Power Management.","Switches;Voltage control;Regulators;Capacitors;Power system management;Phasor measurement units;Receivers","computer power supplies;microprocessor chips;power consumption;security of data;voltage regulators","voltage regulator module;electromagnetic-based side-channel;microarchitectural vulnerability;power management unit;side-channel vulnerability;electromagnetic emanations;modern microprocessors;power consumption;modern computers","","15","","101","IEEE","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many factors influence crop yield, such as soil, amount of water, climate, and genotype. Determining factors that significantly influence yield prediction and identify the most appropriate predictive methods are important in yield management. It is critical to consider and study the combination of different crop factors and their impact on the yield. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to use advanced data analytic techniques to precisely predict the soybean crop yields, (2) to identify the most influential features that impact soybean predictions, (3) to illustrate the ability of Fuzzy Rule-Based (FRB) sub-systems, which are self-organizing, self-learning, and data-driven, by using the recently developed Autonomous Learning Multiple-Model First-order (ALMMo-1) system, and (4) to compare the performance with other well-known methods. The ALMMo-1 system is a transparent model, which stakeholders can easily read and interpret. The model is a data-driven and composed of prototypes selected from the actual data. Many factors affect the yield, and data clouds can be formed in the feature/data space based on the data density. The data cloud is the key to the IF part of FRB sub-systems, while the THEN part (the consequences of the IF condition) illustrates the yield prediction in the form of a linear regression model, which consists of the yield features or factors. In addition, the model can determine the most influential features of the yield prediction online. The model shows an excellent prediction accuracy with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0883, and Non-Dimensional Error Index (NDEI) of 0.0611, which is competitive with state-of-the-art methods.","","978-1-7281-2946-4","10.1109/SNAMS.2019.8931888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8931888","Autonomous Learning;Fuzzy Rule-Based;Multi-Modal;Linear regression;Soybean yield prediction","Agriculture;Data models;Predictive models;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Security;Data analysis","agriculture;crops;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;regression analysis;soil","soybean yield prediction;machine learning;advanced data analytics;yield management;soybean crop yields;ALMMo-1 system;data cloud;data density;linear regression model;autonomous learning multiple-model first-order system;fuzzy rule-based subsystem;soybean predictions","","5","","29","IEEE","16 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since most of the produced energy from distributed renewable sources arises as electricity, electrification of energy consumers and producers, called prosumers, expands. In this context, multimodal distribution grids make use of the storage capabilities of other energy sectors like heat, and abolish the supply-dependency and uncertainty of the feed-in of decentralized generators. This provides flexibility in the energy system, which increases security of supply and at the same time ensures economical energy provision. The subject of this paper is to exploit the flexibility of such a multi-modal energy system for operation in an optimal way. The cellular approach serves here as the energy system architecture. Aim is to provide flexibility with a cell by optimally distributing a flexibility request to subordinate prosumers changing their active and reactive power. The load change is hereby to be optimally dispatched to the different components of the prosumers under consideration of technical restrictions and dynamic behavior of components, the grids and economical aspects. For dynamic modelling and simulation the open-source modelling language Modelica is used. Using a lowvoltage benchmark model expanded by multi-modal technologies, the proposed methodology shows that the cells are capable of providing flexibility to the overlying grid with high accuracy at low costs.","","978-3-8007-6108-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172983","","","","","","","","","","4 Jul 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

However, the robustness of the recognition process becomes a major problem. When identifying unseen categories with traditional finger-vein recognition systems, a few issues remain, such as recognition interference and low efficiency. This paper proposes a Deep Generalized Label Finger-Vein (DGLFV) model to extract feature maps and achieve high-accuracy recognition. The largest rectangular finger-vein region is extracted through image semantic segmentation and the advanced bidirectional traversing and center diffusion method for the known categories. Then we generalize all the unseen categories actively as Class  $C+1$  to reduce interference from unregistered users. Furthermore, an adaptive threshold acquisition algorithm is proposed for Label Receiver Operating Characteristic (LROC), so that the procedures of classification, recognition, and verification are unified.

The distribution network reconfiguration technique is often performed to improve these voltage levels, if not to reduce power losses. However, distribution systems feed various kinds of consumers, and their power demand dependency on bus voltages is different based on their load type. Modifying the network configuration changes the system's nodal voltage levels, and then the load power is also impacted after the reconfiguration. Only a few research works in the field of distribution system reconfiguration have included load power dependency to nodal voltages in their proposed models. However, these studies have not discussed whether adding voltage-depend loads to the reconfiguration problem is beneficial or only increases the computational efforts without substantial gains on the optimal solution. With the intention to fill this gap, this article develops a comprehensive analysis of how the change of load according to the voltage affects reconfiguration solutions. This investigation aims to help distribution system researchers and readers understand this phenomenon and highlight the benefits and drawbacks of taking it into account. Also, a robust reconfiguration model for considering load types and nodal voltage is proposed. The model is validated in different network models and sizes, where the obtained results are compared with other models presented in the literature. The results analysis indicates that voltage fluctuations impact the distribution network configuration through voltage effect on power losses and the system nodal loads. Also, load voltage-dependent models are more flexible than constant demand based-formulations in finding feasible solutions in more restricted voltage tolerances.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2023.3278801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10142233","Distribution system;load type;network re-configuration;power demand;voltage fluctuations","Load modeling;Voltage;Mathematical models;Computational modeling;Distribution networks;Analytical models;Voltage control","","","","","","","IEEE","1 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, most of the research achievements regarding to the game models are based on the hypothesis that both the two sides' players are completely rational, which is hard to meet. Therefore, we combined the evolutionary game theory and Markov decisionmaking process to construct a multi-stage Markov evolutionary game model for network attack-defense analysis, in view of the bounded rationality constraint. The model, based on the non-cooperative evolutionary game theory, could accomplish dynamic analysis and deduction for the multi-stage and multi-state network attack-defense process. In addition, an objective function with discounted total payoffs was designed by analyzing payoff characteristics of the multi-stage evolutionary game, which is more consistent with the reality of network attack and defense. Besides, the solving method for multi-stage game equilibrium was proposed on the basis of calculating the single-stage evolutionary game equilibrium. In addition, an algorithm for optimal defense strategy of the multi-stage evolutionary games was given.

Given its appealing usability, such zero-effort authentication has already been deployed in the real-world where a computer terminal or a vehicle can be unlocked by the mere proximity of an authentication token (e.g., a smartphone). However, existing systems based on a single authentication factor contains one major security weakness - unauthorized physical access to the token, e.g., during lunch-time or upon theft, allows the attacker to have unfettered access to the terminal. We introduce ZEMFA, a zero-effort multi-factor authentication system based on multiple authentication tokens and multi-modal behavioral biometrics. Specifically, ZEMFA utilizes two types of authentication tokens, a smartphone and a smartwatch (or a bracelet) and two types of gait patterns captured by these tokens, mid/lower body movements measured by the phone and wrist/arm movements captured by the watch. Since a user's walking or gait pattern is believed to be unique, only that user (no impostor) would be able to gain access to the terminal even when the impostor is given access to both of the authentication tokens. We present the design and implementation of ZEMFA. We demonstrate that ZEMFA offers a high degree of detection accuracy, based on multi-sensor and multi-device fusion. We also show that ZEMFA can resist active attacks that attempt to mimic a user's walking pattern, especially when multiple devices are used.","2643-4202","978-1-7281-3265-5","10.1109/PST47121.2019.8949032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949032","Authentication;Biometrics;Walking-pattern;Phone;Wearables;Sensors;Context","","authorisation;biometrics (access control);gait analysis;mobile computing;smart phones","ZEMFA;multimodal gait biometrics;zero-effort authentication;authentication token;single authentication factor;zero-effort multifactor authentication system;multisensor fusion;multidevice fusion","","4","","55","IEEE","6 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing published work on robustness either does not scale to large-scale dataset, or does not deal with multiple modalities. This work aims to study several key questions related to multi-modal learning through the lens of robustness: 1) Are multi-modal models necessarily more robust than uni-modal models? 2) How to efficiently measure the robustness of multi-modal learning? 3) How to fuse different modalities to achieve a more robust multi-modal model? To understand the robustness of the multi-modal model in a large-scale setting, we propose a density-based metric, and a convexity metric to efficiently measure the distribution of each modality in high-dimensional latent space. Our work provides a theoretical intuition together with empirical evidence showing how multi-modal fusion affects adversarial robustness through these metrics.

Thailand is a developing country located at the heart of Southeast Asia, with about 66 million of population as of 2006. The electricity supply industry structure under the government of Thailand has been managed by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, the Metropolitan Electricity Authority, and the Provincial Electricity Authority for almost 50 years. According to the 2004 Power Development Plan, the country would have generation reserve at a marginal of 15%. Due to the rapid economic growth and difficulty in building new centralized generating facilities, this has the potential to create a security issue of electricity energy shortage and may develop a severe system blackout. Renewable energy issues have been widely discussed and debated over the country. Although solar energy is the most prominent renewable energy source due to the appropriate geographic of Thailand, it is still considered as a low-density energy source which requires a large area of installation. Therefore, for the long-term investment, wind power seems to be a good candidate because it is quick to install, needs no fuel cost, and is environment friendly. Therefore, this paper investigates the impact of the penetration level of wind power generation to be integrated into the Thailand system. System stability has been observed in various system configuration changes due to different control strategies of wind farms. The economic analysis of wind-farm investment has been also considered.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2008.2002177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4629378","Capacity factor (CF);dynamic stability;generation interconnection;induction generator (IG);penetration level","Design optimization;Wind energy;Renewable energy resources;Power generation;Power system economics;Power generation economics;Environmental economics;Fuel economy;Investments;Petroleum","power generation economics;power generation planning;wind power plants","wind power planning;low-medium-wind-speed profile;emerging energy crisis;crude oil;renewable energy;Thailand;Southeast Asia;rapid economic growth;electricity energy shortage;low-density energy source;wind-farm investment","","10","","7","IEEE","19 Sep 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A multimodal biometric template protection approach with fusion at score level using fingerprint and face templates is proposed. The proposed approach includes two basic stages, enrollment stage and verification stage. During the enrollment stage, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied on the face images to embed the fingerprint features into different directional sub-bands. Watermark embedding and extraction are done by quantizing the mean values of the wavelet coefficients. Subsequently, the inverse DWT is applied to obtain the watermarked image. Following this, a unique token is assigned for each genuine user and a hyper-chaotic map is used to produce a key stream in order to encrypt a watermarked image using block-cipher. The experimentation results indicate the efficiency of the proposed approach in term of achieving a reasonable error rate of 3.87%.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9104637","multi-modal biometric template protection;watermarking;biometric encryption;block-cipher;token;hyper-chaotic map","","","","","2","","","","1 Jun 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Hence, to improve the AV's perception capabilities, this article proposes a multi-modal mechanism known as Audio-Visual Cognitive Processing System (AV-CPS), which combines speech and gesture inputs from users to enable spontaneous passenger control for AVs.

The resulting violence or crime leads to terrible consequences. How to utilize reasonable means to predict the dangerous intentions of massive crowds and prevent the potential hazard to the public is significant for social security. A crowd monitoring and management system is an effective way to detect abnormal behavior. In this article, we release unmanned aerial vehicles as well as fixed ground devices to achieve multi-level and multi-modal behavioral sensing on a massive crowd, deploy a hybrid model in edge cloud to extract global features from behavioral data of a massive crowd, and then utilize these global features to construct decent classification algorithms for action recognition and behavioral semantic cognition. With the cooperation of behavioral data and cognitive algorithms, we can understand the instantaneous emotions of the crowd. On the basis of behavioral data and the emotional state of the crowd, the correlation between daily behavior and any dangerous intention of a massive crowd has been revealed by utilizing behavioral big data analysis, which is a key foundation for predicting people's dangerous intentions. Finally, we conduct a case study of abnormal behavior detection based on pix2pix and continuous video frames. The experimental results show that the performance of our method is better than other algorithms in both public datasets and the customized Hajj dataset. The proposed novel pattern for the effective learning of a massive crowd is validated to effectively eliminate some of the possible dangers caused by abnormal behavior.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.014.2000523","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9829310","","Surveillance;Semantics;Big Data;Feature extraction;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Cognition;Stability analysis;Behavioral sciences;Sensors;Image edge detection;Prediction algorithms","autonomous aerial vehicles;behavioural sciences computing;Big Data;cloud computing;data analysis;emotion recognition;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);robot vision;video signal processing","social security;management system;massive crowd;global feature extraction;behavioral data;daily behavior;dangerous intention;behavioral big data analysis;abnormal behavior detection;crowd monitoring system;multilevel behavioral sensing;multimodal behavioral sensing;edge cloud;cognitive algorithms;abnormal behavior learning;edge computing;stability;crowd management system;classification algorithm;action recognition;dangerous intention prediction;unmanned aerial vehicles;behavioral semantic cognition;pix2pix;continuous video frames;customized Hajj dataset","","1","","15","IEEE","13 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a new framework, SWIFT, that automatically generates test packets with network configurations. SWIFT minimizes the number of test packets by allowing a packet to go through multiple links or interfaces. For network updates, SWIFT updates test packets in an incremental way to revalidate the network. We evaluate its performance using hundreds of benchmark network configurations.

The approach uses RECO, a surprisal-based metric that captures key features of an ecosystem's resilient structure, as an objective to strategically design the electrical network. The approach enables solvability and practicality by introducing a stochastic-based candidate branch creation algorithm and a Taylor series expansion for relaxation of the RECO formulation.

However, one major issue pertinent to unimodal system remains. It has to do with actual biometric characteristics of users being permanent, and their number being limited. Thus, if user's biometric is compromised, it might be impossible or highly difficult to replace it in a particular system. Cancellable biometric for individual biometric has been a significantly understudied problem. The concept of cancelable biometric or cancelability is to transform a biometric data or feature into a new one so that users can change their single biometric template in a biometric security system. However, cancelability in multimodal biometric has been barely addressed at all. In this paper, we tackle the problem and present a novel solution for cancelable biometrics in multimodal system. We develop a new cancelable biometric template generation algorithm using random projection and transformation-based feature extraction and selection.

The main advantage of such systems is their ability to detect multiple features associated with the crowd gathering, as they enable multi-source sensors, multi-modal data, and powerful intelligent and analytical methods. Unlike traditional crowd monitoring systems, which make use of simplex forms of different data types, data and information associated with crowded scenarios can be collected, fused, processed and analyzed in large quantities for accurate global assessment and enhanced decision making processes in an ICMMS. Therefore, data fusion is introduced as an enabler to decrease data quantity, reduce data dimensions, and improve data quality. In this paper, we first survey the literature on data fusion application in crowd monitoring systems as we are developing a state-of-the-art ICMMS with data fusion as a major platform enabler. Next, we discuss some popular data fusion architectures and classifications from different perspectives. Based on this, we propose a multi-sensor, multi-modal, and dimensional ICMMS architecture based on data fusion. Then, we identify the data fusion processes in the ICMMS and classify them into sensor fusion, feature-based data fusion, and decision fusion. Relevant algorithms, applications and examples of three classes are elaborated.

Traditional biometrics primary focus is on person identification. However, via soft biometric processing, different general information of a user may be exploited. A multimodal approach has a lot of potential to overcome several fundamental constraints of a unimodal scheme when it comes to security, privacy, and identification. It is observed that there has been a surge in passion for widening biometric prediction capabilities to include easily quantifiable factors like the subject's age, and more recently, advanced qualities like emotional or mental states. In this regard, multimodal biometric features of a person are used to predict their corresponding age using a deep convolutional neural network. The datasets used in this study are acquired locally using a customized hardware setup, and this database includes the palm print, palm vein, dorsal vein, and wrist vein images of an individual. The features of each biometric are extracted and fused at the score level, followed by the age prediction using a tailored deep convolutional neural network. A Sequential model is built, and Adam optimization is applied, and the loss function of the model is determined by mean squared error values. The obtained error values from the model show decent error rates for different learning percentages. The experimental results obtained using the proposed method are competitive to previous studies.","","978-1-6654-3888-9","10.1109/MysuruCon52639.2021.9641556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9641556","Biometric;Convolutional Neural Network;Deep learning;Fusion;Multimodal biometric","Wrist;Deep learning;Biometrics (access control);Error analysis;Veins;Biological system modeling;Feature extraction","convolutional neural nets;data privacy;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;image fusion;vein recognition","emotional states;mental states;multimodal biometric features;palm vein;dorsal vein;wrist vein images;tailored deep convolutional neural network;multimodal biometric age prediction;deep learning framework;traditional biometrics primary focus;person identification;soft biometric processing;unimodal scheme;privacy;biometric prediction capabilities;quantifiable factors;learning percentages","","","","41","IEEE","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When processing these digital transactions, recognizing each merchant’s real identity (i.e., business type) is vital to ensure the integrity of payment processing systems. Conventionally, this problem is formulated as a time series classification problem solely using the merchant transaction history. However, with the large scale of the data, and changing behaviors of merchants and consumers over time, it is extremely challenging to achieve satisfying performance from off-the-shelf classification methods. In this work, we approach this problem from a multi-modal learning perspective, where we use not only the merchant time series data but also the information of merchant-merchant relationship (i.e., affinity) to verify the self-reported business type (i.e., merchant category) of a given merchant. Specifically, we design two individual encoders, where one is responsible for encoding temporal information and the other is responsible for affinity information, and a mechanism to fuse the outputs of the two encoders to accomplish the identification task.

This paper explores the possibility of combining features from the same biometric trait (fingerprints) i.e. keeping it unimodal but still offering the same security as that of the combined biometrics. In this paper, using minutiae and orientation features from two different fingerprints, a new unique mixed fingerprint template is generated. The advantage of creating the mixed template is that it is cancellable and serves as a new virtual identity. Further Gabor feature of the mixed template is extracted before matching to reduce the error rate. Testing the templates is done using 2 methods, viz: correlation based and minutiae based. These two methods were effective in identifying the templates accurately.

According to the WHO, good health is not only about zero sicknesses or disability but is also about physical well-being, sound mental state and social and spiritual welfare. The technological implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in mental health has vast potential for personalizing treatment selection, prognostication, and relapse monitoring. Moreover, it provides remedies to reduce stress and anxiety for situations that do not require immediate and necessary medical intrusion and emergency contacts and services in case of a severe condition. Particularly, to discern depressive behaviours, multi-modal data is used to examine and exploit a large variety of parameters. Unlike the usual method of having an observational study that is done by taking surveys or questionnaires, the AI model helps us to understand and explore the inconspicuous and reliable detection of depressive symptoms obtained from visual and vocal features of the user. In today's time, vocalizing one's concerns regarding their mental health must be normalized. As humans, it is normal to feel different emotions at once. The application is free and anonymous to make the users feel empowered and safe in seeking treatment. Mental health is all about how an individual thinks, feels and copes up with events in their life.","","978-1-6654-2577-3","10.1109/ICONAT53423.2022.9726090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9726090","ChatBot;RASA;Convolutional Neural Network;Mental Health","Visualization;Sociology;Neural networks;Mental health;Speech recognition;Depression;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;emotion recognition;health care;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical information systems;patient treatment;public domain software;security of data","medical health;mental health;sound mental state;spiritual welfare;human emotion detection;medical intrusion;social welfare;artificial intelligence;AI;stress reduction;anxiety reduction;emergency contacts;emergency services;CNN;RASA;personalizing treatment selection;prognostication;relapse monitoring","","1","","20","IEEE","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional video forensics approaches can detect and localize forgery traces in each video frame using computationally-expensive spatial-temporal analysis, while falling short in real-time verification of live video feeds. The recent work correlates time-series camera and wireless signals to recognize replayed surveillance videos using event-level timing information but it cannot realize fine-grained forgery detection and localization on each frame. To fill this gap, this paper proposes Secure-Pose, a novel cross-modal forgery detection and localization system for live surveillance videos using WiFi signals near the camera spot. We observe that coexisting camera and WiFi signals convey common human semantic information and the presence of forgery attacks on video frames will decouple such information correspondence. Secure-Pose extracts effective human pose features from synchronized multi-modal signals and detects and localizes forgery traces under both inter-frame and intra-frame attacks in each frame. We implement Secure-Pose using a commercial camera and two Intel 5300 NICs and evaluate it in real-world environments. Secure-Pose achieves a high detection accuracy of 95.1% and can effectively localize tampered objects under different forgery attacks.","2641-9874","978-1-6654-0325-2","10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488798","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488798","Surveillance system;video forgery;cross-modal authentication","Location awareness;Wireless communication;Surveillance;Semantics;Streaming media;Cameras;Feature extraction","computer crime;data compression;feature extraction;image forensics;object detection;security of data;video signal processing;video streaming;video surveillance;wireless LAN","cross-modal forgery detection;intra-frame attacks;synchronized multimodal signals;Secure-Pose extracts effective human pose features;common human semantic information;camera spot;WiFi signals;localization system;fine-grained forgery detection;event-level timing information;replayed surveillance videos;time-series camera;real-time verification;video frame;forgery traces;traditional video forensics approaches;surveillance cameras;illegal human activities;authentic live video streams;video forgery attacks;render surveillance systems;live surveillance videos;high detection accuracy","","5","","30","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an efficient online personal identification system based on Multi-Spectral Palmprint (MSP) images using Contourlet Transform (CT) and Gabor Filter (GF) response. In this study, the spectrum image is characterized by the contourlet coefficients sub-bands. Then, we use the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for modeling the observation vector. In addition, the same spectrum is filtered by the Gabor filter. The real and imaginary responses of the filtering image are used to create another observation vector. Subsequently, the two sub-systems are integrated in order to construct an efficient multi-modal identification system based on matching score level fusion.

Next, we show how to construct a model for vulnerability evaluations, which can represent the behavior of a cloud system in the occurrence of faults or during the execution of operations. The cloud system model consists of state transition models for components of a system with interdependency relationships. In this model, state transitions in a component invoked by the executions of configuration change operations or the occurrences of component faults can trigger state transitions in other components due to the dependency between these components. Using this model, we analyze the propagation of the fault's effect between components having interdependencies.

As a step towards the more practical application scenarios, we introduce a novel task that aims to describe a video using the natural language dialog between two agents as a supplementary information source given incomplete visual data. Different from most existing vision-language tasks where AI systems have full access to images or video clips, which may reveal sensitive information such as recognizable human faces or voices, we intentionally limit the visual input for AI systems and seek a more secure and transparent information medium, i.e., the natural language dialog, to supplement the missing visual information. Specifically, one of the intelligent agents - Q-BOT - is given two semantic segmented frames from the beginning and the end of the video, as well as a finite number of opportunities to ask relevant natural language questions before describing the unseen video. A-BOT, the other agent who has access to the entire video, assists Q-BOT to accomplish the goal by answering the asked questions. We introduce two different experimental settings with either a generative (i.e., agents generate questions and answers freely) or a discriminative (i.e., agents select the questions and answers from candidates) internal dialog generation process. With the proposed unified QA-Cooperative networks, we experimentally demonstrate the knowledge transfer process between the two dialog agents and the effectiveness of using the natural language dialog as a supplement for incomplete implicit visions.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3093360","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NeTS-2109982); Cisco; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9468337","Video description;dialog agents;multi-modal learning","Task analysis;Visualization;Artificial intelligence;Natural languages;Knowledge transfer;Semantics;Video description","computer vision;image segmentation;interactive systems;Internet;natural language interfaces;natural language processing;natural languages;robot vision;video signal processing","video descriptions;dialog agents;complete visual data;intentional vision block;practical application scenarios;natural language dialog;supplementary information source;incomplete visual data;existing vision-language tasks;AI systems;video clips;sensitive information;recognizable human faces;voices;visual input;secure information medium;transparent information medium;missing visual information;intelligent agents;relevant natural language questions;unseen video;internal dialog generation process;incomplete implicit visions","Algorithms;Humans;Semantics","1","","82","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It thus promises broad application prospects in power generation. The whole generation system should operate in both stand-alone mode and grid-connected mode to provide uninterrupted and continuous power to critical loads. The two operating modes have different control structures due to separate control targets, increasing the control complexity of the power generator system. This paper proposes the control winding (CW) current-oriented vector control method for BDFIG in grid-connected mode, which has unique advantages in stand-alone mode. First, the modified variables are obtained under the CW-current rotating frame; Second, the power expression of the system is deduced according to the modified variables; Third, the angle of CW was chosen as a new control degree of freedom based on phase-angle control to realize power control. The proposed control strategy analyzed the control principle of CW-current amplitude and angle control in detail. This method adopts the same orientation strategy with stand-alone mode, which avoids the switching of orientation strategy in different operation modes, thus simplifying the system design a lot. Moreover, considering the same criteria GSC control, reactive power compensation, the control during grid voltage recovery and so on, the large CW-current can be limited at a safety level once the overload or grid faults happened, which can easily achieve Low-Voltage-Ride-Through (LVRT) and significantly increased security and stability of the system. Finally, the proposed control strategy is verified by the experimental results.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2023.3277820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10129920","Brushless doubly fed induction generator;CW-current-oriented;grid-connected operation;phase-angle control;power control","Power control;Windings;Rotors;Control systems;Reactive power;Doubly fed induction generators;Complexity theory","","","","","","","IEEE","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper revisits the notion of power system adequacy and highlights the need for consideration of some factors that have hitherto tended not to be part of a transmission expansion planning process, in particular in respect of the credible range of possible values of system operating conditions and transitions between successive operating states. Firstly, we present some definitions of power system operational regions. Secondly, we present a stochastic optimisation model that measures the adequacy of a transmission network for given future operating conditions. Uncertainties in demand and generation are modelled using a large number of scenarios. The optimisation model identifies the critical future operating conditions needing the special attention of a power system planner. The proposed model is simulated on a 39-bus network, whereby it is shown that this model can identify critical operating conditions that need the attention of a system planner.","","978-88-941051-2-4","10.1109/PSCC.2016.7540959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7540959","adequacy assessment;transmission planning;renewable energy sources;stochastic optimisation","Power systems;Uncertainty;Investment;Planning;Security;Optimization;Stochastic processes","optimisation;power transmission planning;stochastic processes","adequacy assessment;future electricity networks;transmission expansion planning process;stochastic optimisation model;39-bus network","","2","","19","","11 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the issue of attack strength did not get enough attention so that most existing resilient WADCs may fail to defend strong attacks. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multiple-controller switching approach based resilient wide-area damping controller (MCS-RWADC) to suppress inter-area oscillations and mitigate strong attacks. It is inclusive of multiple secure networked prediction control based modules (SNPMs) and a switch-monitor module (MSM). The SNPM can detect attacks, differentiate attack strength and compensate for weak attacks. In terms of strong attacks, multiple SNPMs are implemented to work as backup and three operating states as well as the corresponding switching rules are designed to realize automatic switching among them. MSM is responsible for monitoring the states and directing the switching. Case studies are conducted on a 4-area 5-terminal voltage source converter-based multi-terminal high voltage direct current based offshore wind farm integration system. Simulation results verify MCS-RWADC cannot only suppress the inter-area oscillation but also handle the strong attacks under a wide range of operating conditions with various wind power output.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2022.3215785","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52022035); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9925069","Wide-area damping control;inter-area oscillation;strong attacks;multiple-controller switching;offshore wind","Switches;Damping;Control systems;Phasor measurement units;Oscillators;Cyberattack;Wind power generation","HVDC power transmission;offshore installations;power engineering computing;power generation control;predictive control;security of data;voltage-source convertors;wind power plants","4-area 5-terminal voltage source converter-based multiterminal high voltage direct current based offshore wind farm integration system;attack-resilient controllers;automatic switching;inter-area oscillation;MCS-RWADC;mitigate strong cyber attack;multiple secure networked prediction control;multiple-controller switching approach;operating conditions;resilient WADC;resilient wide-area damping control based modules;SNPM;switch-monitor module;switching rules;wind power output","","","","44","IEEE","19 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

MCS core characteristic is user involvement in data collection, processing, analysis and sharing. Due to the opt-in nature of MCS systems, a number of critical concerns is raised that should be efficiently addressed so as to enable MCS unimpeded advancement. Data reported by users could be unintentionally inaccurate and/or deliberately falsified. Thus, ensuring data quality and integrity in MCS constitutes one of its key challenges. This paper firstly discusses on the data quality challenge and identifying its interdependencies with different underlying key issues. Subsequently, we comprehensively survey representative reputation-based trust establishment mechanisms proposed in related research literature in the context of MCS, as a potential solution to the data quality problem.

A biometric system that uses a single biometric trait to identify persons must deal with issues such as spoof attacks, trait non-universality, substantial intra-class variability, limited degrees of freedom, and noisy data.

We defined the three-factor decision paradigm in the model. On the basis of the reference model, we analyze the feature requirement in the data intelligent process and summarize it as three key aspects: semantic, interactive and iterative. Further, we analyze several major challenges facing IoT data and decision intelligence from the perspective of data characteristics.

In satellite MEC, the raw data of edge users vested in different owners cannot be allowed to be shared, considering data privacy requirements. To address this, federated learning (FL) architecture can be applied to satellite MEC where only parameters and model updates can be transmitted, which avoids the interaction of raw data from diverse sources. In this article, we construct a FL-based satellite MEC architecture, followed by introducing its key techniques in the aspects of resource management and multi-modal data fusion.

The prototype was used to perform collection, selection, and reporting functions on common symmetric block ciphers, where the collection function included running benchmark tests and storing the data in DBMS located on DSOCARE server. The runtime optimal cryptographic algorithm selector (ROCAS), based on a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) method, was used to find Pareto-optimal solutions for a diverse array of client security requests with high and low security, speed, and priority quality of service (QoS) parameters. Finally, the reporting function was used to create the data and figures presented in this paper.

To address this issue, we propose a new method for images-to-video face recognition that pairs face images with multiple attributes (soft labels) and face image quality (FIQ). This is followed by the application of three calibration methods to estimate the likelihood ratio, which is a statistical measure commonly used in forensic investigations. To validate the results, we test our method on the ENFSI proficiency test 2015 dataset, using SCFace and ForenFace as calibration datasets and three embedding models: ArcFace, FaceNet, and QMagFace. Our results indicate that using only high quality frames can improve face recognition performance for forensic purposes compared to using all frames.

The features generated by iris and fingerprint images are fused at the feature level. The generated fused feature vector template cannot be stored directly on the server, if stored directly can lead to various privacy and security concerns. So, these templates are encrypted in such a way that even when applying any operations on the templates, the templates should be in encrypted form. So, the operations need to be performed in the encrypted domain without decrypting it, and the final result, when decrypted should again give back the correct result as if the operations are performed on the original data. Fully Homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme is designed to satisfy the above conditions. FHE is used to compute the hamming distance between the reference and probe template in an encrypted domain. To improve accuracy rotational invariant technique is used, which solves rotational inconsistency problems. The computational speed is increased by using a batching scheme to reduce the number of operations during homomorphic multiplication. We have conducted our experiment on the IITD and CASIA dataset.

A distributed networked system (DIS) that collects raw data from sensors deployed in the field and delivers a composite data to an end-user is faced with two types of uncertainties: at 'information level' due to the multi-modal nature of raw data collected from the environment, and at 'control level' due to the incompleteness in knowledge about the application model. These have a compounded effect on the quality of fault-tolerance exhibited by a DIS. Based on service-layer abstractions, the paper identifies application-oriented metrics to quantify the quality of information flowing through a DIS. Even with imperfect information, the paper demonstrates how the high-level quality metrics and control algorithms enable achieving a reasonable degree of fault-tolerance in a probabilistic manner.

This also partially realizes the growing trend towards the use of TCP/IP technology for smart grid applications.","2326-5949","978-1-4799-5893-1","10.1109/ASMS-SPSC.2014.6934575","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6934575","satellite systems;secure group communications;policy;key management;smart grid;GDOI","Satellites;Smart grids;Satellite broadcasting;Protocols;Cryptography;IP networks","computer network security;cryptography;direct broadcasting by satellite;Internet;smart power grids;transport protocols","cryptographically heterogeneous networks;Internet services;multicasting capability;satellite services;smart grid group applications;logical-geographical-cryptographic domains;group domain of interpretation;GDOI;smart grid centralized key-policy management architecture;DOI;protocol signaling overhead;TCP-IP technology","","1","","21","IEEE","23 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we explore various multi-modal biometrics employing feature level and score level fusion to improve the biometric performance of the system. An extensive number of experiments are conducted using two different devices - Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. The database consisting of 46 subjects has provided a performance with best Genuine Match Rate (GMR) of 95.52% for smartphone and 96.65% GMR for tablet.

The special feature of these is the designing for operation in two modes: normal and emergency. Digital components can accumulate hidden failures over a long-term normal mode. This reduces their fault tolerance and functional safety of the system in the most responsible emergency mode. Two conditions for occurrence of the hidden fault problem as a growth one are considered in view of a resource approach, which in the development of models, methods and means highlights levels of replication and diversification. Safety-related systems are analyzed as computer systems that have increased to the level of diversification to address the security challenge. Their components are still stamped at a level of resource replication using matrix structures to process data in parallel codes. Fault-tolerant solutions become fault-safe with a sufficient level of circuit checkability, which is commonly known as testability, i.e. structural checkability, depending only on the structure of the circuit. In the operating mode, the checkability becomes structurally-functional, and in critical applications it is converted into a dual-mode, the shortage of which causes the hidden fault problem. A method of analyzing circuits for the possibility of hidden faults is suggested. The method is illustrated on example of an iterative array multiplier implemented in an FPGA project with a LUT-oriented architecture. A program model for the resulting scheme has been developed and potentially dangerous points have been found in it in which the hidden fault problem of may manifest itself.","","978-1-7281-5566-1","10.1109/TCSET49122.2020.235591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9088661","hidden fault;FPGA;LUT-oriented architecture;safety-related system;digital component;growth problem;resource approach;replication;diversification;matrix structure;checkability;iterative array multiplier;potentially dangerous points","","fault diagnosis;fault tolerance;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit reliability;logic design;multiplying circuits;safety;table lookup","hidden fault analysis;FPGA project;safety-related systems;long-term normal mode;fault tolerance;functional safety;responsible emergency mode;hidden fault problem;computer systems;LUT-oriented architecture;iterative array multiplier;matrix structures;circuit checkability","","16","","41","IEEE","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the lack of scientific understanding of the basic laws of safety risks, personal accidents are repeatedly happened, leading to vicious electric shock accidents. In addition, if faults cannot be handled quickly and in a timely manner, ground faults can easily cause device overvoltage, causing equipment burnout and even causing fire accidents. Single phase grounding fault and power failure will reduce the reliability of power supply and directly affect industrial production and people's living standards. This article is mainly based on the international advanced safety management concept. By identifying the influencing factors of single-phase grounding in distribution networks and closely integrated with power grid enterprises actual field operations, using the “5M safety risk factor” theory to analyze the personal safety and equipment safety influencing factors in power supply operations, extract six major influence factors that have a greater impact on the distribution network operation and personal safety. Based on the above points, a quantitative assessment model, index, and method system for single-phase fault processing based on security protection are proposed to effectively improve the person and device safety in power grid companies. Pre-control ability has very important practical value and promotion significance.

Owing to the availability of multiple factors of evidence biometric systems that are multi-modal are considered to be more reliable. In visual interactions among humans, facial recognition is one of the most commonly acceptable biometrics. Selection of features is a challenging task as the interaction among the facial features can be complex.

Unlike cookies, fingerprinting is a stateless technique that does not store any information on devices, but instead exploits unique combinations of attributes handed over freely by browsers. The uniqueness of fingerprints allows them to be used for identification. However, browser fingerprints change over time and the effectiveness of tracking users over longer durations has not been properly addressed. In this paper, we show that browser fingerprints tend to change frequently-from every few hours to days-due to, for example, software updates or configuration changes. Yet, despite these frequent changes, we show that browser fingerprints can still be linked, thus enabling long-term tracking. FP-STALKER is an approach to link browser fingerprint evolutions. It compares fingerprints to determine if they originate from the same browser. We created two variants of FP-STALKER, a rule-based variant that is faster, and a hybrid variant that exploits machine learning to boost accuracy. To evaluate FP-STALKER, we conduct an empirical study using 98,598 fingerprints we collected from 1, 905 distinct browser instances. We compare our algorithm with the state of the art and show that, on average, we can track browsers for 54.48 days, and 26 % of browsers can be tracked for more than 100 days.","2375-1207","978-1-5386-4353-2","10.1109/SP.2018.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8418634","Privacy;browser fingerprinting;browsers","Browsers;Microsoft Windows;Portable document format;Security;Privacy;Fingerprint recognition;Target tracking","data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);online front-ends","browser fingerprinting;FP-STALKER approach;browser instances","","28","","26","IEEE","26 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, many of these methods do not consider that social security asks for real-time solutions: active cameras require flexible distributed systems in sensible areas as airports, hospitals, stations, squares and roads.

This paper proposes a framework for integrating biometric key based authentication into an IMS. The generated keys need to be consistent. Consistency of keys is attained if the same key is generated for every instance of biometric input. Generation of long and consistent keys directly from feature sets poses a challenge due to intra and inter user variations inherent to biometric data. A novel methodology for generating consistent keys using principles of vector quantization and cluster based learning is introduced. 15-bit keys have been extracted from handwritten signature datasets.

The condensation algorithm is a kind of ""factored sampling"" and it can easily cope with multi-modal probability density of objects' positions. We track objects not in images but in 3D space. We use a condensation particle-set as a tracker and represent a position of a moving object by a center of tracker.

A 16 Hz standard deviation is demonstrated at 125 MHz, with a working frequency band in the 60 to 133 MHz range, answering the requirements for using Rayleigh- and Love-wave-based delay lines operating with 40-μm acoustic wavelength transducers. Moreover, this electronic setup was used to interrogate a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR) microbalance, a new sensor class allowing for multi-mode interrogation for gravimetric measurement improvement. The noise source still limiting the system performance is due to the analog-to-digital converter of the microcontroller, thus leaving open degrees-of-freedom for improving the obtained results by optimizing the voltage reference and board layout. The operation of the system is illustrated using a calibrated galvanic deposition at the surface of Love-wave delay lines to assess theoretical predictions of their gravimetric sensitivity and to compare them with HBAR-based sensor sensitivity.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2013.2685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6521071","","","acoustic transducers;analogue-digital conversion;bulk acoustic wave devices;gravimeters;Love waves;microbalances;Rayleigh waves","high-sensitivity open-loop electronics;gravimetric acoustic-wave-based sensor;chemical species detection;gas phase;security control;open-loop interrogation strategy;radio-frequency acoustic transducer;chemical compound monitoring;gaseous phase state;liquid-phase state;standard deviation;Rayleigh-wave-based delay lines;Love-wave-based delay lines;acoustic wavelength transducer;high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator microbalance;HBAR microbalance;sensor class;multimode interrogation;gravimetric measurement improvement;noise source;system performance;analog-to-digital converter;microcontroller;voltage reference;board layout;calibrated galvanic deposition;gravimetric sensitivity;HBAR-based sensor sensitivity;frequency 16 Hz;frequency 60 MHz to 133 MHz","","10","9","22","IEEE","31 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address the challenges, we first investigate privacy concerns in B5G edge intelligence networks and design privacy-driven application clarification strategies.

While single-trait bio-metric user identification is widely utilised at the moment, it does not offer sufficient authentication for highly secure applications. To solve these issues, researchers have developed multi-modal bio-metric systems.

This paper aims to develop an efficient system for driving stress detection under real driving circumstances. Multiple physiological signals, i.e., electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and respiration (RESP) were collected and multi-modal features were extracted from time, spectral, and wavelet domains. The proposed approaches are motivated by three points: 1) Obvious individual difference affects the transferability of trained models to a new drive. Then, through dissimilarity evaluation and hierarchical clustering, we searched for subgroups of drives that presented relatively consistent feature distributions. Performing cross-drive modeling within each subgroup enables us to identify driver statuses more precisely with less computation cost; 2) fusing the high-dimensional physiological data from multiple views is beneficial to achieve a reliable assessment but brings new challenges for existing techniques. We adopted Multi-view Intact Space Learning (MISL) to integrate rich information from multiple perspectives by constructing a latent intact representation of the data; 3) most of the existing systems are offline. The current study made both offline and online analysis to validate the effectiveness of this research.

The model has been evaluated over various huge publicly available biometric databases. To the best of our knowledge this is the first unified architecture proposed, segmenting multiple biometric traits.

For interpreting the multimodal interactions under attacks, we learn a weakly-supervised sound source visual localization model to localize sounding regions in videos. To mitigate multimodal attacks, we propose an audio-visual defense approach based on an audio-visual dissimilarity constraint and external feature memory banks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that audio-visual models are susceptible to multimodal adversarial attacks; audio-visual integration could decrease the model robustness rather than strengthen under multimodal attacks; even a weakly-supervised sound source visual localization model can be successfully fooled; our defense method can improve the invulnerability of audio-visual networks without significantly sacrificing clean model performance.

To reconfigure between selective and simultaneous activation in a multielement array, each WAND has a dipole resonance mode for MR signal acquisition and two butterfly modes that support counter-rotating current circulation. Because detectors in the same row share the same lower butterfly frequency but different higher butterfly frequency, a pumping signal at the sum frequency of the dipole mode and the higher butterfly mode can selectively activate individual resonators, leading to 4-fold sensitivity gain over passive coupling. Meanwhile, a pumping signal at the sum frequency of the dipole mode and the lower butterfly mode can simultaneously activate multiple resonators in the same row, leading to 3-fold sensitivity gain over passive coupling. When multiple rows of detectors are parallelly aligned, each row has a unique lower butterfly frequency for consecutive activation during the acquisition interval of the others.

IoT devices collect or produce huge multi-modal data that is either processed on the edge or sent to a central cloud for processing. The collected data sets are pre-processed by methods known as “feature selection”, to remove redundant, irrelevant, or noisy features. Feature selection will help with improving the results achieved by the learning method as well as reducing the computational complexity of the model. The goal is to select the most informative features of data and only transmit the selected features to the edge/cloud servers for further processing. This leads to smaller costs for data transmission to the servers. In this paper, a novel wrapper-based federated feature selection (FFS) algorithm is proposed, where IoT devices collaborate to select the most informative features without sharing their local data sets. The proposed FFS algorithm uses binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA) in a federated and collaborative manner to select a small enough subset of informative attributes and provide an improved trade-off between communication cost and learning accuracy. Our experimental results on three data sets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and MAV demonstrate that the proposed BGSAFFS method can in average remove more than 50% of features without losing information. The obtained results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving a good trade-off between accuracy and communication cost in comparison to other state-of-the-art feature selection methods as well as a no-feature selection baseline.","","978-1-6654-5719-4","10.1109/ICNC57223.2023.10074296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074296","Feature selection;Federated Learning;Internet-of-Things;Machine Learning","Learning systems;Costs;Smart cities;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Internet of Things;Servers","cloud computing;computational complexity;computer network security;feature extraction;feature selection;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems;smart cities","binary gravitational search algorithm;central cloud;collaborative manner;collected data sets;data transmission;feature selection algorithm;federated manner;FFS algorithm;huge multimodal data;improved trade-off between communication cost;informative features;IoT devices;IoT environments;learning accuracy;learning method;local data sets;no-feature selection baseline;noisy features;novel wrapper-based;smart city initiative;state-of-the-art feature selection methods;Things applications;wrapper-based federated feature selection","","","","12","IEEE","23 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is based on edge orientation matching (EOM) and subsequent candidate verification using a SNoW (Sparse Network of Winnows) classifier in the final stage. We have developed a simple and efficient EOM method for object modeling and matching using edge orientation information only. To make the system more robust, we verify face candidates obtained by the EOM with a view-based SNoW classifier which operates directly on the grey values. For further speedup, the pipelined matcher is combined with a coarse-to-fine grid scan of the image. On average, it thus requires less than 10% of all possible image locations to be processed by the detection pipeline. With this method, it takes 50 ms on an Athlon 1000-MHz PC to analyze an image of spatial size 384/spl times/288 pixels. Experimental results on a large database of 18,704 grey still images with 19,030 detectable frontal faces, including the M2VTS (Multi-Modal Verification for Teleservices and Security applications) frontal face database, the CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) test set of H.A.

In this work, a method framework of fault diagnosis system based on the Vibration Observation Window (VOW) for air compressors is proposed. The VOW constructs a dynamic vibration tensor which presents the operating state of air compressors according to the real time vibration data, strengthens the association among the monitoring data in spatial domain and time domain. Thus, dynamic characteristic, which reflects the fault information, can be contained in the dynamic vibration tensor explicitly. For proving the advantage of VOW method, we compare the performance between the fault diagnosis system with VOW and the fault diagnosis system without VOW based on different hardware environments: embedded computer, and high speed Industrial PC.

In view to increase security, an attempt of deploying multiple machine learning techniques on fused pattern have been explored and developed. Two enhanced algorithms of Chaotic Neural Network and NeuroEvolution of the augmenting topology have been devised and applied on the fused features. To verify the trustworthiness of the proposed system, several experiments have been deployed on both unimodal and multimodal systems. After several experiments performed, the algorithms reveal that multi biometric system exhibit higher recognition rates and lower false rejection rates compared to unimodal systems. In this research, we have also shown that algorithms have the possibility to countermeasure the loopholes that may occur at the matching module. We have achieved a good recognition rate of 99.1% by adopting score level fusion by using the proposed NeuroEvolution of the augmenting topology algorithm compared to previous research work conducted.

Due to the lack of infrastructure to measure all points of interest, the high measurement cost, and the unavoidable transmission loss, network monitoring systems suffer from the problem that the network traffic data are incomplete with only a subset of paths or time slots measured. Recent studies show that tensor completion can be applied to infer the missing traffic data from partial measurements. Although promising, the interaction model adopted in current tensor completion algorithms can only capture linear and simple correlations in the traffic data, which compromises the recovery performance. To solve the problem, we propose a new tensor completion scheme based on Lightweight Trilinear Pooling, which designs (1) a Trilinear Pooling, a new multi-modal fusion method to model the interaction function to capture the complex correlations, (2) a low-rank decomposition based neural network compression method to reduce the storage and computation complexity, (3) an attention enhanced LSTM to encode and incorporate the temporal patterns in the tensor completion scheme.

The problem of high dimensionality of the combined features is overcome by the used of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in the feature extraction phase. One challenge in multi modal feature level fusion is to maintain the balance of the features selected between the two modalities, otherwise one modality may outweigh another. In order to address this issue, we propose to perform feature fusion in the feature selection phase. Feature selection using GA with modified fitness function is applied to the concatenated features in order to ensure that only significant and most balanced features are used for classification.

In a lockable obfuscation scheme there exists an obfuscation algorithm Obf that takes as input a security parameter, a program P, a message msg and lock value lck and outputs an obfuscated program oP. One can evaluate the obfuscated program oP on any input x where the output of evaluation is the message msg if P(x) = lck and otherwise receives a rejecting symbol. We proceed to provide a construction of lockable obfuscation and prove it secure under the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption. Notably, our proof only requires LWE with polynomial hardness and does not require complexity leveraging. We follow this by describing multiple applications of lockable obfuscation. First, we show how to transform any attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme into one in which the attributes used to encrypt the message are hidden from any user that is not authorized to decrypt the message. (Such a system is also know as predicate encryption with one-sided security.) The only previous construction due to Gorbunov, Vaikuntanathan and Wee is based off of a specific ABE scheme of Boneh. By enabling the transformation of any ABE scheme we can inherent different forms and features of the underlying scheme such as: multi-authority, adaptive security from polynomial hardness, regular language policies, etc. We also show applications of lockable obfuscation to separation and uninstantiability results. We first show how to create new separation results in circular encryption that were previously based on indistinguishability obfuscation. This results in new separation results from learning with error including a public key bit encryption scheme that it IND-CPA secure and not circular secure. The tool of lockable obfuscation allows these constructions to be almost immediately realized by translation from previous indistinguishability obfuscation based constructions. In a similar vein we provide random oracle uninstantiability results of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation (and related transformations) from the lockable obfuscation combined with fully homomorphic encryption. Again, we take advantage that previous work used indistinguishability obfuscation that obfuscated programs in a form that could easily be translated to lockable obfuscation.","0272-5428","978-1-5386-3464-6","10.1109/FOCS.2017.62","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8104094","","Encryption;Standards;Electronic mail;Computer science;Complexity theory","computational complexity;public key cryptography","lockable obfuscation scheme;obfuscated programs;indistinguishability obfuscation based constructions;security parameter;lockable obfuscation;learning with errors;polynomial hardness;attribute-based encryption;IND-CPA secure;fully homomorphic encryption","","64","","81","IEEE","13 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If the representation space is well chosen, each operating mode can be represented as a class. A hidden Markov model is then designed for each class and used as classifier for the detection and diagnosis of faults.

Inside AIRBUS Defence & Space, the focus on X-band antennas today is on airborne and fighter nose radars, in satellite based SAR antennas (synthetic aperture radar) for earth observation, and ground surveillance and security radars. Active airborne antennas are assembled with hundreds or even thousands of transmit/receive modules. This paper will describe the evolution of the so-called standardized module solution based on LTCC package technology with special regard to airborne applications and the correlated needs. This evolution especially contains significant optimization steps concerning area, weight and cost. By realization of an SMTR® Module suitable to a folded plank concept a significant reduction of installation depth could be achieved. As the module weight is dominated by its package, technology evaluation and implementation of advantageous concepts and materials was performed, here. Cost reduction is always a key focus of T/R module evolution as the modules still allocate a big part of antenna's production cost. Some steps have been realised here both on technology and component level. The next generation of AESA antennas will result in a combination of different operating modes within the same antenna front end, including radar, communication (data links), and jamming (electronic warfare, EW). This leads to enhanced demands especially towards the MMICs. The RF section of today's T/R modules for AESA applications is typically based on GaAs technology. During the last 10 years there was much progress in the development of disruptive semiconductor materials, especially GaN and SiGe BiCMOS, which have the potential to challenge or even replace the GaAs technology, here. This paper will describe and show this evolution through the last years and shall give an outlook towards future developments with regard to airborne applications.","1097-5764","978-1-4799-4195-7","10.1109/RADAR.2014.7060400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060400","T/R Module;AESA;X-Band;Airborne","Substrates;Radio frequency;Gallium nitride;Arrays;Radar antennas;Spaceborne radar","airborne radar;beam steering;ceramic packaging;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;integrated circuit packaging;jamming;MMIC;radar antennas;remote sensing by radar","airborne applications;active electronically steered antenna;X-band antenna;airborne radar;fighter nose radar;satellite based SAR antenna;earth observation;ground surveillance;security radar;active airborne antenna;transmit-receive module;standardized module;LTCC package technology;SMTR module;folded plank concept;cost reduction;T/R module;antenna production cost;MMIC;AESA applications;disruptive semiconductor materials;jamming;antenna front end;GaAs","","10","","11","IEEE","16 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Counting clicks and beeps: Exploring numerosity based haptic and audio PIN entry","A. Bianchi; I. Oakley; D. S. Kwon",NA; NA; NA,"Interacting with Computers","18 Jan 2018","2012","24","5","409","422","Haptic and audio cues now appear commonly in computer interfaces, partially due to inherent advantages such as their support for eyes-free interaction. Their invisible, unobservable nature also makes them ideal candidates for security interfaces in which users have to enter secret information such as passwords. In particular, researchers have explored this idea through the design of PIN entry authentication systems based on multi-modal combinations of visual and non-visual content or on the recognition of small sets of unimodal haptic or audio stimuli. This paper highlights the benefits and performance limitations of these approaches and introduces an alternative based on unimodal audio or haptic temporal numerosity – the ability to accurately and rapidly determine the number of cues presented in rapid temporal succession. In essence, in a numerosity interface, rather than recognizing distinct cues, users must count the number of times that a single cue occurs. In an iterative process of design and evaluation, three prototypes implementing this concept are presented and studies of their use reported. The results show the fastest PIN entry times and lowest error rates to be 8 s and 2%, figures that improve substantially on previous research. These results are attained while maintaining low levels of workload and substantial resistance to observation attack (as determined via camera attack security studies). In sum, this paper argues that unimodal audio and haptic numerosity is a valuable and relatively unexplored metaphor for non-visual input and demonstrates the validity of this claim in the demanding task of unobservable authentication systems.","1873-7951","","10.1016/j.intcom.2012.06.005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8147050","Human factors;Haptics and audio;Authentication;Mobile","","","","","13","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Motivated by the ubiquity of commercial cloud platforms, data owners are willing to store their graph databases remotely. However, data privacy has emerged as a widespread concern since the cloud platforms are not fully trusted. One viable solution is to encrypt sensitive data before outsourcing, which inevitably hinders data retrieval. To enable queries over encrypted data, searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) has been introduced. Yet, the most well-studied class of SSE schemes focuses on retrieving textual files given keywords, which cannot be applied to graph databases directly. This paper extends our preliminary work (FC’17) and proposes GraphShield, a structured encryption scheme for graphs. Beyond shortest distance queries, GraphShield can support other classic graph-based queries (e.g., maximum flow) and more complicated analytics (e.g., PageRank). Technically, we incorporate a suite of (efficient) cryptographic primitives and tailor some extra secure protocols for facilitating graph analytics. Our scheme also allows updates on the encrypted graph with forward privacy guaranteed. We formalize the security model and prove the adaptive security with reasonable leakage. Finally, we implement our scheme on various real-world datasets, and the experiment results demonstrate its practicality and scalability.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.3024883","NSFC(grant numbers:61822207,U1636219); Outstanding Youth Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2017CFA047); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2042019kf0210); NRF(grant numbers:2016K1A1A2912757); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200757","Searchable encryption;graph encryption;shortest distance query;graph analytics","Encryption;Data privacy;Protocols;Electronic mail;Databases","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;database management systems;graph theory;outsourcing;query processing","GraphShield;secure queries;forward privacy;graph-structured data catalyzes analytics;graph databases;semantic queries;commercial cloud platforms;data owners;data privacy;sensitive data;data retrieval;encrypted data;searchable symmetric encryption;SSE schemes;structured encryption scheme;shortest distance queries;classic graph-based queries;cryptographic primitives;tailor some extra secure protocols;graph analytics;encrypted graph","","11","","53","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Applications such as personal identification, access control, forensics appli-cations, e-banking, e-government, e-health and recently person-alized human-smart-home and human-robot interaction present some examples. In order to offer person-specific services for/of specific person a pre-identifying step should be done in the run-up. Using biometric in such application is encountered by diverse challenges. First, using one trait and excluding the others depends on the application aimed to. Some applications demand directly touch to biometric sensors, while others don't. Second challenge is the reliability of used biometric arrangement. Civilized application demands lower reliability comparing to the forensics ones. And third, for biometric system could only one trait be used (uni-modal systems) or multiple traits (Bi- or Multi-modal systems). The latter is applied, when systems with a relative high reliability are expected. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive view about biometric and its application. The above mentioned challenges will be analyzed deeply. The suitability of each biometric sensor according to the aimed application will be deeply discussed. Detailed com-parison between uni-modal and Multi-modal biometric system will present which system where to be utilized. Privacy and security issues of biometric systems will be discussed too.

Dynamic texture and shape clues are respectively encoded by a two-branch deep CNN model at different rates so that discriminative details are sufficiently captured, and they are combined at intervals for more comprehensive description. Moreover, a 3D model guided data augmentation method is applied to generate a diversity of samples with various poses, which further enhances the anti-spoofing model. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on three public benchmarks, i.e. 3DMAD, HKBU-MARs V1 and SMAD, and the results achieved are state-of-the-art, demonstrating its effectiveness for this issue.","","978-1-7281-3079-8","10.1109/FG47880.2020.00019","Research and Development; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320244","3D face mask anti spoofing;dynamic texture and shape;deep fusion","Three-dimensional displays;Faces;Videos;Feature extraction;Shape;Face recognition;Two dimensional displays","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);face recognition;geometry;image colour analysis;image fusion;image reconstruction;image texture;pose estimation;security of data;shape recognition;stereo image processing;video signal processing","face recognition;shape clues;dynamic texture;multimodal dynamics fusion network;deep fusion;MM-DFN;RGB data;geometry information;depth sensors;RGB image reconstruction;two-branch deep CNN;3DMAD dataset;HKBU-MARs V1 dataset;SMAD dataset;3D face mask antispoofing","","6","","46","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Continuous identification and authentication of users through monitoring social behavior improves detection of identity spoofing. In this paper, we propose a social behaviometric framework to cope with identity spoofing on smartphones. The proposed framework consists of a front-end client module that acquires and provides social networking data to the back-end module which runs online machine learning procedures and provides analytics as a service to the front-end in order to verify user identity through social interactions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework by using real data collected from participants, and inject noisy behavioral patterns to simulate identity spoofing scenarios. Performance results show that under anomalous behavioral patterns, the proposed system can identify genuine users with up to 97% success ratio using an aggregated behavior pattern on five different social network applications.","1938-1883","978-1-4673-8999-0","10.1109/ICC.2017.7997423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997423","","Social network services;Biometrics (access control);Mobile communication;Measurement;Mobile computing;Smart phones;Authentication","behavioural sciences;data acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;security of data;smart phones;social networking (online)","noisy behavioral patterns;online machine learning procedures;back-end module;social networking data;front-end client module;behaviometric information;social networking applications;multimodal data acquisition;smart mobile devices;social behavior;next generation soft biometrics tools;social network information;built-in sensors;sociability metrics;smartphones;spoofed identities","","4","","20","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, trained artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as Support vector machine (SVM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been proposed to recognize distinct and discriminant features of biometric information (intrinsic hand features and demographic cues) with good classification accuracy. Unfortunately, due to nonlinearity in distinct and discriminant features of biometric information, accuracy of SVM and ANFIS is reduced. As a result, optimized AI algorithms ((ANFIS) with subtractive clustering (ANFIS-SC) and SVM with error correction output code (SVM-ECOC)) have shown to be effective for biometric information recognition. In this paper, we compare the performance of the ANFIS-SC and SVM-ECOC algorithms in their effectiveness at learning essential characteristics of intrinsic hand features and demographic cues based on Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) feature selection. Furthermore, the accuracy of these algorithms are presented, and their recognition performances are evaluated by root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), scatter index (SI), mean absolute deviation (MAD), coefficient of determination  $(R^{2})$ , Akaike’s Information Criterion (AICc) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency index (NSE). Evaluation results show that both SVM-ECOC and ANFIS-SC algorithms are suitable for accurately recognizing soft biometric information on basis of intrinsic hand measurements and demographic cues.

Their presence is now wide spread in sensitive areas such as home automation, industrial control systems, medical devices and security systems. As their popularity has increased, so has the urgency to protect and defend these networks. The decentralized nature of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for maintaining network security and intrusion detection. RF-fingerprinting provides a unique physical (PHY) layer defense against node counterfeiting by identifying rogue devices through their RF-emissions. In previous work, feature generation from received RF signals was accomplished with parametric variables such as standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, all based on the assumption of a normal distribution of a particular region of interest. We show in this work that most collected signals are either multi-modal or non-parametric. Use of non-parametric methods for feature generation such as mean, median, mode, and trend represented by linear model coefficient estimates are shown to be much more applicable to the non-parametric distribution of the collected ZigBee preamble, resulting in improved classification performance of devices. Non-parametric classifier Random Forest is used with both parametric and non-parametric features to provide a classification performance comparison. Performance improvements of upto 9% in correct classification rates have been achieved and an effective gain of 4 dB SNR was realized.1","2329-6275","978-1-4673-7557-3","10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7208645","","Zigbee;Signal to noise ratio;Authentication;Performance evaluation;Linear regression;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;Internet of Things;Zigbee","nonparametric feature generation;RF-fingerprinting;ZigBee devices;Internet of Things;ZigBee ad-hoc networks;nonparametric classifier random forest","","14","","22","IEEE","20 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the demand for automatically constructing large-scale multiple-choice VQA data grows, we introduce a novel task called textual Distractors Generation for VQA (DG-VQA) focusing on generating challenging yet meaningful distractors given the context image, question, and correct answer. The DG-VQA task aims at generating distractors without ground-truth training samples since such resources are rarely available. To tackle the DG-VQA unsupervisedly, we propose GOBBET, a reinforcement learning(RL) based framework that utilizes pre-trained VQA models as an alternative knowledge base to guide the distractor generation process. In GOBBET, a pre-trained VQA model serves as the environment in RL setting to provide feedback for the input multi-modal query, while a neural distractor generator serves as the agent to take actions accordingly. We propose to use existing VQA models’ performance degradation as indicators of the quality of generated distractors. On the other hand, we show the utility of generated distractors through data augmentation experiments, since robustness is more and more important when AI models apply to unpredictable open-domain scenarios or security-sensitive applications. We further conduct a manual case study on the factors why distractors generated by GOBBET can fool existing models.","2160-7516","978-1-6654-8739-9","10.1109/CVPRW56347.2022.00539","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9856989","","Training;Visualization;Computational modeling;Knowledge based systems;Training data;Reinforcement learning;Data models","learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis;video signal processing","pre-trained VQA model;distractor generation process;GOBBET;neural distractor generator;existing VQA models;generated distractors;textual Distractors Generation;multiple-choice visual question answering;multiple-choice VQA data;challenging yet meaningful distractors;DG-VQA task;ground-truth training samples","","","","50","IEEE","23 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applications of UAVs in urban environments include photography and film-making, security monitoring, real estate, construction, property and infrastructure inspections, leisure, public safety (fires, natural disasters, investigations), traffic, and much more. Emerging UAV applications include last-mile drone delivery services. This paper discusses urban scenarios where drones are more ubiquitous. Monitoring and related safety of these UAVs will be increasingly important. Though multi-modal purpose-built drone tracking and monitoring systems will be the most effective solution for detection and tracking of these RPAS, during the transition to more regular drone use in urban areas and in everyday urban applications, a more rapid-deployment and agile detection system is needed that does not require installation of hardware. In this paper, sensory substitution is presented as an approach to use ambient and pre-existing microphones and AI techniques to detect the presence of RPAS.

The universal Internet connectivity of such smart objects has brought about a new era of ubiquitous application development for the Internet of Things. Meanwhile, security has become critically important. In the past decade, academia and industry have dedicated great efforts to the design of continuous authentication for multi-modal networks. Multiform authentication bio-tokens have been introduced for continuous entity identification and verification. With the rapid growth and universality of wearable devices, in this article we target continuous authentication for the IoT-based environment with users possessing wearable healthcare (and wellness) related smart objects. To present the state of the art, we provide a comprehensive review of continuous authentication in recent years. Critical characteristics of new biometrics are then introduced. Second, we present a wearable plantar bio-feature extractor constructed via commercial pressure sensors and the Raspberry PI platform. The prototype is adopted to retrieve user plantar bio-data as the raw (and training) data in the proposed authentication system. Third, we apply machinelearning- based techniques to derive a user's plantar bio-features as authentication tokens in the system to support continual (and real-time) entity verification in the background without the user's notice.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8291131","","Authentication;Biometrics (access control);Electrocardiography;Support vector machines;Password;Biomedical monitoring","biometrics (access control);health care;Internet;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);microcomputers;pressure sensors;ubiquitous computing","continuous user authentication;plantar biometrics;comprehensive evolution;information communication technologies;mobile sensing objects;versatile ubiquitous network services;intelligent wearable devices;universal Internet connectivity;smart objects;ubiquitous application development;Internet of Things;multimodal networks;multiform authentication bio-tokens;continuous entity identification;wearable healthcare;wearable plantar bio-feature extractor;user plantar bio-data;authentication system;authentication tokens;machine learning-based techniques;Raspberry PI platform;continuous entity verification;specific-purpose modern sensors","","27","","15","IEEE","13 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Gender information can act as a vital preprocessing ingredient for enhancing speech analysis applications like adaptive human-machine interfaces, multi-modal security applications, and sophisticated intent and context analysis based forensic systems. In uncontrolled environments like telephone speech applications, the gender recognition system should be adaptive, accurate, and robust to noisy environments. This paper presents a reasoning method governed by Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence for automatic gender recognition from telephone speech. The proposed method uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients with a support vector machine to generate the initial prediction results for individual speech segments. The reasoning scheme collects and validates results from support vector machine and treats convincing predictions as valid evidence. It is argued that the consideration of valid evidence in the reasoning process improves recognition performance by avoiding unconvincing classification results. Experiments conducted on large speech datasets reveal the superiority of the proposed gender recognition scheme for speech analysis applications.","","978-1-4673-8685-2","10.1109/PlatCon.2016.7456788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7456788","","Speech;Support vector machines;Cognition;Feature extraction;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Speech analysis","cepstral analysis;inference mechanisms;speech recognition;support vector machines","Dempster-Shafer fusion;speech analysis applications;evidence theory;automatic gender recognition;telephone speech;Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;support vector machine","","9","","15","IEEE","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm starts analysis from HV/MV substations with all loads (MV/LV substations) being disconnected and picks up loads that result in minimal incremental losses. Optimality is always assured by checking on relationships correlating currents and paths, using the concept of dynamic programming and performing configuration changes whenever required. The algorithm relies on the comparison of the incremental losses brought by the addition of each and every load to the network. Quadratic and linear relationships between load currents and paths form the basis of the decisions made for the connections. The algorithm is illustrated with the help of a detailed numerical example.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The development and deployment of a fully connected transportation system that makes the most of multi-modal, transformational applications requires a robust, underlying technological platform. The platform is a combination of well-defined technologies, interfaces, and processes that, combined, ensure safe, stable, interoperable, reliable system operations that minimize risk and maximize opportunities. The primary application area of connected vehicles is the vehicle safety. These applications are designed to increase situational awareness and reduce or eliminate crashes through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) data transmission that supports: driver advisories, driver warnings, and vehicle and/or infrastructure controls. These technologies may potentially address a great majority of crash scenarios with unimpaired drivers, preventing tens of thousands of automobile crashes every year. Since V2V and V2I communications and a significant data processing are involved, the connected vehicles concept also requires resiliency and immunity for cyber security issues. This panel session will discuss technology, applications, dedicated short range communications (DSRC) technology and capabilities, policy and institutional issues, and international research on the subject matter.","","978-1-4673-6741-7","10.1109/ITEC.2015.7165725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165725","","Accidents;Connected vehicles;Reliability;Systems operation;Vehicle safety","","","","","","","IEEE","27 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
