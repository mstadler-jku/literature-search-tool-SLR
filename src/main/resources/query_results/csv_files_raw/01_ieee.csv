It also goes without saying that this approach to computing shares its own challenges the most echoed being security. Security concerns herein, birthed by the exposure of the cloud to different threats, continue to cast doubts on potential users and it's only befitting that such concerns are addressed. Users who entrust their data to the cloud want their data to be secured in the strongest terms possible. Once data leaves the user, the onus is on the cloud provider to provide the required security since data now lies within their perimeter of jurisdiction. But security requirements do change with time and this therefore calls for a continuous process of evaluating the security status of the cloud system. This paper proposes a model of analyzing the security status of the cloud system with regards confidentiality, integrity and availability. We employ state transitions of a conceptual finite state machine, Boolean algebra and logic to evaluate the various states of the system when a specified breach occurs. The scope of this paper is limited to user data on the cloud and not as it traverses the network between the user and the provider.","","978-1-4673-8515-2","10.1109/CCI.2016.7778962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778962","cloud computing;threats;state transitions;Boolean logic","Cloud computing;Security;Computational modeling;Analytical models;NIST;Software as a service","Boolean algebra;cloud computing;finite state machines;security of data","integrated state transition-Boolean logic model;security analysis;cloud computing;security requirements;security status evaluation;cloud system;confidentiality;integrity;availability;conceptual finite state machine;Boolean algebra","","","","20","IEEE","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The recent articles indicate that Ormon PLCs used Fins Ethernet protocol were exposed to mode-switching malicious network attack. However, the traditional detection methods based on function codes and Snort detection rules could not get an ideal result. In this paper, we propose a method that can overcome these problems in dealing with mode-switching attack by an external hash authentication device embedding asymmetric encryption.

The first objective is to minimize the real power loss and the Total Voltage Deviations (TVDs), and the second objective is to minimize incremental system loss. Then a Filter Collaborative State Transition Algorithm (FCSTA) is presented for solving DRPO problems. Two populations corresponding to two different objectives are employed. Moreover, the filter technique is utilized to deal with constraints.

State transition diagrams, the graphical representation of penetrations, identify precisely the requirements for and the compromise of a penetration and present only the critical events that must occur for the successful completion of the penetration. State transition diagrams are written to correspond to the states of an actual computer system, and these diagrams form the basis of a rule based expert system for detecting penetrations, called the state transition analysis tool (STAT). The design and implementation of a Unix specific prototype of this expert system, called USTAT, is also presented. This prototype provides a further illustration of the overall design and functionality of this intrusion detection approach.

To handle more complex state transformations, the framework includes a number of extension mechanisms designed to minimize the overall programming effort. Our experience with real-world programs suggests that our framework can handle all the standard C idioms and support safe and automated state transfer for complex state changes.

For each Unix process, the user credentials, which are user identifiers, determine the process privilege, including whether a process has gained a high privilege, such as that of the superuser. The state transition technique is applied to a suitably defined process state, identified by certain classes of user credential values. A transition takes place when these values change from one class to another. These states are clearly defined, and prohibited state transitions as well as some supporting rules are identified. When many break-ins succeed, either the rules are violated or these prohibited transitions occur, and this implies a violation of system security policy. A specially modified system call, ktrace0, is used by the superuser to monitor the process-state and state transition analysis is applied to the traced information, by the Intrusion Detection System. Tests show that most known security violations belonging to the targeted classes (such as buffer overflow exploits) can be detected (and possibly pre-empted) while the constituent activities are still being processed in the kernel.","1063-9527","0-7695-0346-2","10.1109/CSAC.1999.816050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=816050","","Intrusion detection","security of data;Unix","process state transition analysis;security breach detection;computer system;Unix process;user credential;user identifiers;process privilege;superuser;prohibited state transitions;break-ins;system call;ktrace;process state monitoring;traced information;Intrusion Detection System","","3","","21","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fins protocol as one of the most popular protocols is built into a larger number of Ormon devices that are used in different kinds of measurement, and control systems and has been targeted as the desirable candidate for cyber-attack. However, the traditional detection method based on traffic analysis and function code compliance detection is unable to detect mode-switching attack that is consistent with the protocol syntax, and it is a very harmful network attack against industrial devices. In this paper, we analyze the defects of measurement and control system using Fins protocol, launch mode-switching attack against Ormon PLC devices and display how to defend against this attack by designing a detection rules insert into Snort.

This paper proposes a semantic based intrusion detection scheme where state transition analysis, pattern matching and data mining techniques are integrated to maximize the detection accuracy. Patterns and rules are formulated based on the events detected by WSN. The sink receives information about the several events happening in the coverage area and correlates the streaming data (events) in spatial domain (several sensors) and time domain. The semantic rules are developed using ANTLR tool. The proposed scheme has been validated using a surveillance system for detecting an intruder. Implementations prove that the proposed hybrid intrusion detection scheme can accurately detect an intruder with the help of a wired network and an appropriate database.","","978-1-4577-0590-8","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972244","Wireless Sensor Network (WSN);Intrusion Detection System (IDS);ANTLR","Radiofrequency identification;Pattern matching;Intrusion detection;Image sensors;Grammar;Semantics","computer network security;data mining;pattern matching;wireless sensor networks","state transition analysis;pattern matching;metamorphosed;semantic based intrusion detection scheme;data mining technique;WSN;data streaming;spatial domain;time domain;semantic rules;ANTLR tool;surveillance system;hybrid intrusion detection scheme","","6","","19","IEEE","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional RA model ignores the non-dispatchable start-up and shut-down processes of combustion turbines and steam turbines (i.e. transition trajectories) in CCGTs and is less considered about the effect from natural gas system.

Specifically, basic information is obtained from network traffic. In our framework, the first-level detection uses convolutional neural network (CNN) to feature extraction and anomaly identification. In the second-level detection, we propose a process state transfer algorithm. The feature extracted by the CNN model is invoked as the input of the algorithm to construct the normal state process transfer model of ICS. The model detects whether the current data meets the normal state transition process of the system, and may find unknown attacks or 0-day attacks. Finally, through laboratory gas pipeline network system verification, we found that the anomaly detection framework combined with the two methods has more outstanding performance than several current latest technologies.","2374-9628","978-1-5386-6808-5","10.1109/PCCC.2018.8710993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8710993","Industrial Control System;anomaly detection;convolutional neural network;process state transfer algorithm","Integrated circuits;Feature extraction;Anomaly detection;Intrusion detection;Convolution","control engineering computing;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;industrial control;pipelines;production engineering computing;security of data;telecommunication traffic","convolutional neural network;feature extraction;anomaly identification;process state transfer algorithm;CNN model;normal state process transfer model;normal state transition process;laboratory gas pipeline network system verification;ICS data;industrial control equipment;ICS business logic stability;network traffic;industrial control systems;intrusion detection;two-level anomaly detection","","11","","28","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, a bit based pattern matching algorithm with FSM state transition controller for both parallel processing and assertion based input payload validity check is proposed. Here during the matching process, the Finite State Machine (FSM) state controller will be used in case of early misdetection to optimize overall matching time in case of a longer pattern where the rule is being divided into sub patterns and the successive matches are halted which is done parallel with sub patterns. To avoid synchronization problem over parallel matching process unique controllers are used which is driven with fully integrated page enabled sub groups. The efficiency of FSM state controlled pattern matching process is proved over speed and power metrics.

In this paper, we classify common consensus algorithms based on how they decide the order of system state changes. We then determine the extent to which each category prioritizes scalability, decentralization, and security. As with other engineering design scenarios, this is a choose-two tradeoff. Our key contribution is that, based on this taxonomy of tradeoffs, we are able to discern the types of consensus algorithms that work well within the application area(s) for a given distributed system. We find that a dichotomy of algorithms between leader-based and voting-based consensus algorithms emerges from this taxonomy.

This paper presents a state transition model to describe the dynamic behavior of intrusion-tolerant systems. This model provides a framework from which we can define the vulnerability and the threat set to be addressed. We also show how this model helps us to describe both known and unknown security exploits by focusing on impacts rather than specific attack procedures.

To fully utilize the spatial degrees-of-freedom of multiple antennas, the function of antennas at the destination is not predefined, i.e., each antenna can operate in a transmit or receive mode. We propose a low-complexity near-optimal joint optimization scheme by jointly applying the dynamic antenna mode switching (AMS) and optimal power allocation (OPA) techniques, to maximize the secrecy rate of the FD destination-based jamming (DBJ) system. The proposed joint optimization scheme is valid for two different eavesdropping channel state information (ECSI) availability cases, i.e., instantaneous ECSIs and statistical ECSIs. Specifically, closed-form expressions of OPA factors are first derived, and then the optimal transmit and receive antennas sets at the destination are determined by combining the OPA factor and applying a greedy-search-based AMS approach for both ECSIs availabilities, respectively. Moreover, through complexity analysis, the search complexity of the proposed scheme is proven to be significantly reduced compared with the exhaustive searching method.

Embedded NVM provides better security, SOC specific customization, and better integration to other SOC components. It also interacts with many critical modules, like Power Management Controller (PMC), Reset-sequencing State control machine, etc.; while also playing a very important role in power-up sequencing and mode transitions of the chip, since it contains the analog trimming, firmware and final customer application code. The NVM is a big complex component containing Digital and Analog sections, along with Bitcell Arrays and multiplexers. Once integrated in a SOC, it is quite important to check proper functioning of SOC and NVM across power-up and low-power-mode transitions. At present, NVM verification at IP level is done in parts, with individual sub-modules tested separately and limited verification of complete NVM IP after its sub-modules modules are stitched together. At SOC level, verification is done using behavioral model of NVM, which again loses electrical aspect of the signals. Thus mixed-mode simulations at SOC-level are needed for NVM. But, taking the entire NVM-Array in SPICE is an un-necessary load of millions of MOSFETs on the simulator, and beyond the capacity of many tools. The repeated memory-bank-structures do contain a lot of analog circuitry, and optimized techniques can allow for a simulation friendly design-size. We have developed method to model the NVM which allow us to run Chip-level simulations with a SPICE & Verilog-A/AMS views of the NVM.

However, in the LR framework, constructing feasible solutions and updating Lagrangian multipliers are two major challenges, and the efficiency of MILP methods is restricted by the scale of UC problems. To this end, this paper proposes a new fast solution method for large-scale UC based on virtual power boundary. Specifically, first, an initial trial solution is obtained based on the established state transition diagram. Second, a feasibility test model based on virtual power boundary is established to check the feasibility of trial UC solutions effectively. Third, the updating strategies for UC solutions are proposed based on the feasible gap solved by the feasibility test model. The procedure is implemented until a good feasible UC solution is obtained.

During the tip selection process in the unsteady regime, the state transition probability refers to the probability of a transaction changing from the initial state to an arbitrary state. The state transition probability plays an indispensable role in the performance and security analysis of the IoT relying on DAG-based ledgers. In this paper, we derive the exact expression and an approximate expression of the state transition probability, which both are in closed form. In addition, we propose and analyze three performance metrics, i.e., the expected cumulative weight, the expected number of steps, and the confirmation failure probability, which are derived from the state transition probability and greatly enrich the performance analysis and evaluation of the IoT.

Despite of the convenience in collecting information to provide the decision basis for the users, the vulnerability of embedded sensor nodes in multimedia devices makes the malware propagation a growing serious problem, which would harm the security of devices and their users financially and physically in wireless multimedia system (WMS). Therefore, many researches related to the malware propagation and suppression have been proposed to protect the topology and system security of wireless multimedia network. In these studies, the epidemic model is of great significance to the analysis of malware propagation. Considering the cloud and state transition of sensor nodes, a cloud-assisted model for malware detection and the dynamic differential game against malware propagation are proposed in this paper. Firstly, a SVM based malware detection model is constructed with the data sharing at the security platform in the cloud. Then the number of malware-infected nodes with physical infectivity to susceptible nodes is calculated precisely based on the attributes of WMS transmission. Then the state transition among WMS devices is defined by the modified epidemic model. Furthermore, a dynamic differential game and target cost function are successively derived for the Nash equilibrium between malware and WMS system. On this basis, a saddle-point malware detection and suppression algorithm is presented depending on the modified epidemic model and the computation of optimal strategies. Numerical results and comparisons show that the proposed algorithm can increase the utility of WMS efficiently and effectively.","1673-5447","","10.1109/CC.2018.8300282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8300282","Internet of Things;wireless multimedia system;state transition;malware propagation;differential game","Malware;Cloud computing;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Communication system security;Multimedia communication","cloud computing;computer network security;game theory;Internet of Things;invasive software;multimedia communication;radiocommunication;topology","Internet of Things;malware suppression framework;cloud-assisted malware detection;saddle-point malware detection;modified epidemic model;WMS devices;malware-infected nodes;SVM based malware detection;state transition;wireless multimedia network;system security;topology;malware propagation;multimedia devices;embedded sensor nodes;dynamic network service infrastructure;dynamic differential game;IoT;wireless multimedia system","","19","","","","21 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The salient features of VANET, such as highly dynamic connections, sensitive information sharing, and unreliable fading channels, make the security quantification challenging. Accurate measurement for VANET security depends on the sufficient understanding of “context”, or making sense of the states, environment, or situation. This article proposes a context-aware security quantification scheme for VANET based on the Markov chain. Firstly, a Homogeneous Continuous-Time Markov Chain (HCTMC)-based security state model is designed for VANET. The value of each state of the HCTMC is determined with a value function that incorporates the security strength of transmitted data, dynamic and randomness of the vehicular channel, and transmission delay of the current situated environment of VANETs. Finally, the state transition matrix is derived based on the Homogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain (HDTMC) and Homogeneous Poisson Process (HPP). Simulation results show that the security quantification method enables the VANET's system to adopt context-aware defense strategies according to the situated environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3017557","National Nature Science Foundation(grant numbers:61572229,6171101066,61872158,61806083); Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Development Foundation(grant numbers:20170204074GX,20180201068GX,20190103051JH); Jilin Provincial International Cooperation Foundation(grant numbers:20180414015GH); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9170576","Security quantification;VANET;Markov chain;state transition","Security;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Markov processes;Delays;Adaptation models;Vehicle dynamics","Markov processes;probability;stochastic processes;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","context-aware defense strategies;context-aware quantification;VANET security;Markov Chain-based scheme;context-aware security quantification scheme;homogeneous continuous-time Markov chain;security strength;Homogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain;security quantification method;VANET system;security state model;fading channels;sensitive information sharing;HCTMC;HDTMC;state transition matrix;vehicular channel;transmission delay;homogeneous Poisson process;HPP","","11","","27","CCBY","18 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this regard, a converter-based battery dynamic model is presented which includes current- bidirectional DC-DC converter, thereby being able to observe its fast mode change as a response to severe frequency excursions. Also, an active power-frequency characteristic is proposed which considers the impact of battery pre-contingency operating point on its available headroom for primary frequency response provision.

In this work, we propose a novel application of a key-based obfuscation technique to achieve security against hardware Trojans. The obfuscation scheme is based on modifying the state transition function of a given circuit by expanding its reachable state space and enabling it to operate in two distinct modes - the normal mode and the obfuscated mode. Such a modification obfuscates the rareness of the internal circuit nodes, thus making it difficult for an adversary to insert hard-to-detect Trojans. It also makes some inserted Trojans benign by making them activate only in the obfuscated mode. The combined effect leads to higher Trojan detectability and higher level of protection against such attack. Simulation results for a set of benchmark circuits show that the scheme is capable of achieving high levels of security at modest design overhead.","1558-2434","978-1-60558-800-1","10.1145/1687399.1687424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361306","Design obfuscation;hardware security;hardware Trojan","Hardware;Information security;Protection;National security;State-space methods;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Permission;Computational modeling;Logic design","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;invasive software;monolithic integrated circuits;national security;safety-critical software","security;malicious hardware Trojan;design obfuscation;safety-critical applications;state transition function;reachable state space;internal circuit nodes","","68","2","9","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most often the reengineering process ignores to take into account specific non-functional requirements, such as maintainability, for the target system. In this paper, we propose a quality driven software migration framework that aims to identify and extract an object model from a procedural system and to generate quality migrant object oriented code which satisfies non-functional requirements. Such a reengineering framework is composed of quality models to denote desired quality characteristics for the target migrant systems, transformation rules and, an incremental and iterative quality-driven transformation process that is based on a state transition system. The process aims to identify a sequence of software transformations that generate a target system with desired quality characteristics. Moreover, an evaluation technique is presented to verify and validate the achievement of quality requirements in the obtained migrated system.

A dynamic HMM model and a set of expected risk scenarios of CPPS are established based on the observable results of physical system faults by the information system. Furthermore, the corresponding multi-index risk assessment model of CPPS is established to describe the risk propagation ability of the system in its operation state, followed by the migration of the operation mode according to the adjustment of the high-risk event-driven control strategy.

Software that heavily interacts with the underlying OS (e.g., I/O intensive and event-driven applications) suffers from system call overhead. To deteriorate this situation, security vulnerabilities in modern processors have prompted kernel mitigations that further increase the transition overhead. Particularly system-call-heavy applications have been reported to be slowed down by up to 30% with kernel page-table isolation (KPTI), the widely deployed mitigation for the Meltdown vulnerability. To decouple system calls from mode transitions, we revisit an old idea known as system-call batching or multi-calls: the bundling of system calls into a combined call, which only incurs the mode-transition costs of a single one. And then, we have implemented ESCA scheme to adapt system-call batching to Linux-based servers in the light of Meltdown and Spectre, effectively eliminating the slowdown of KPTI-affected applications. Our evaluation shows that the throughputs of real-world applications, benefiting from ESCA, can be improved with only 2 lines of code changed respectively: Nginx by up to 12%, lighttpd by up to 23%, and Redis by 4%.

The focus of this paper is the design of a DOK security service that provides for enforcing both local security policies, related to the security of local autonomous databases, and federated security policies, governing access to data aggregates composed of data from multiple distributed databases. We propose Global Access Control, an extended access control mechanism enabling a uniform expression of heterogeneous security information. Mappings from existing Mandatory and Discretionary Access Controls are described. To permit the control of data aggregation, the derivation of unauthorized information from authorized data, our security framework provides a logic-based language, the Federated Logic Language (FELL), which can describe constraints on both single and multiple states of the federation. To enforce constraints, FELL statements are mapped to state transition graphs which model the different subcomputations required to check the aggregation constraints. Graph aggregation operations are proposed for building compound state transition graphs for complex constraints. To monitor aggregation constraints, two marking techniques, called Linear Marking Technique and Zigzag Marking Technique, are proposed.

The quickest detection algorithm aims at minimizing the worst case detection delays (WDDs) of cyberattacks, subject to an upper bound of the false alarm rate. Since power-grid state transitions could be caused by either cyberattacks or sudden change in loads or grid configurations, we propose to distinguish between an FDIA and a sudden system change by using a time-varying dynamic model, which can accurately capture the dynamic state transitions due to changes in system configurations. A dynamic state estimation algorithm is developed to estimate and track the time-varying and nonstationary power-grid states. The quickest detection algorithm is developed by analyzing the statistical properties of dynamic state estimations, such that the algorithm minimizes the WDD while accurately distinguishing FDIA from sudden system changes. A Markov-chain-based analytical model is used to identify the detector’s parameter and quantify its performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can accurately detect and remove false data injections or system faults with minimum delays. The proposed algorithm can be implemented to harden intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) or supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to improve their resilience to cyberattacks or system faults, thus improving the cybersecurity of smart grids.","2168-6785","","10.1109/JESTPE.2019.2936587","U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-OE0000779); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1711087); U.S. Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative AFOSR(grant numbers:MURI 18RT0073); NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1717454,CNS-1731424,CNS-1702850,CNS-1646607); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8808884","Cyberattack;dynamic load change;dynamic state estimation;false data injection;power system","Power system dynamics;Heuristic algorithms;Delays;State estimation;Smart grids;Detection algorithms","delays;distributed sensors;Markov processes;open loop systems;power system security;power system state estimation;SCADA systems;security of data;smart power grids","false data injection attacks;smart grid;quickest intrusion detection algorithm;FDIA;time-varying dynamic model;worst case detection delays;cyberattacks;false alarm rate;power-grid state transitions;grid configurations;dynamic state transitions;system configurations;dynamic state estimation algorithm;nonstationary power-grid states;dynamic state estimations;Markov-chain-based analytical model;false data injections;system faults;supervisory control","","9","","38","IEEE","21 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Stateful network protocols have complex communication interactions and state transitions. However, the existing network protocol fuzzing does not support state transitions very well. This paper focuses on this issue and proposes the Semi-valid Fuzzing for the Stateful Network Protocol (SFSNP). The SFSNP analyzes protocol interactions and builds an extended finite state machine with a path marker for the network protocol; then it obtains test sequences of the extended finite state machine, and further performs the mutation operation using the semi-valid algorithm for each state transition in the test sequences; finally, it obtains fuzzing sequences. Moreover, because different test sequences may have the same state transitions, the SFSNP uses the state transition marking algorithm to reduce redundant test cases. By using the stateful rule tree of the protocol, the SFSNP extracts the constraints in the protocol specifications to construct semi-valid fuzz testing cases within the sub-protocol domain, and finally forms fuzzing sequences. Experimental results indicate that the SFSNP is reasonably effective at reducing the quantity of generated test cases and improving the quality of fuzz testing cases. The SFSNP can reduce redundancy and shorten testing time.","1007-0214","","10.23919/TST.2017.8030535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8030535","network protocol fuzzing; extended finite state machine; test sequence; state transition markingalgorithm; semi-valid algorithm","Testing;Security;Software;Trajectory;Transport protocols;Redundancy","computer network security;finite state machines;fuzzy set theory;program testing;transport protocols","SFSNP analyzes protocol interactions;extended finite state machine;test sequences;semivalid algorithm;state transition;stateful rule tree;protocol specifications;semivalid fuzz testing cases;Stateful Network Protocol;Semivalid Fuzzing;subprotocol domain;network protocol fuzzing","","2","","","","11 Sep 2017","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

An anti-attack switched event-triggered mechanism (ATASETM) is designed by considering the impact of ADoS attacks on the systems. Based on the mechanism, the entire time interval is split into rest intervals, continuous detection intervals, residual intervals, and ADoS active-attack intervals. The closed-loop system (CLS) is represented as a three-mode switched system by merging these intervals. Subsequently, a three-piecewise Lyapunov function is constructed for fewer conservative criteria to ensure that the CLS is $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ exponentially stable. An exact expression of the relationship between the decay rate and length of the dormant- and active-attack intervals is obtained. On the basis of the proposed criteria, a joint-design strategy is developed in terms of linear matrix inequalities for the desired trigger matrix and feedback gain. Lastly, a satellite control system and an inverted pendulum model are used to validate the ATASETM-based stability analysis and $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ security control approaches. Numerical results demonstrate that the maximum allowable exponential decay rate decreases with increasing attack time (and vice versa), and the optimal $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ performance level becomes worse as the attack time or the difficulty of the event triggering increases.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2023.3243095","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61503002); Anhui Provincial Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:202004a07020028); National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2020R1A2C1005449); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10039713","Denial-of-service attacks;event-triggered control;  $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$   control;networked control systems;piecewise Lyapunov function","Control systems;Security;Switches;Denial-of-service attack;Lyapunov methods;Control theory;Symmetric matrices","asymptotic stability;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;feedback;H∞ control;linear matrix inequalities;Lyapunov methods;networked control systems;pendulums;switching systems (control)","ADoS active-attack intervals;anti-attack switched event-triggered mechanism;aperiodic DoS attacks;ATASETM-based stability analysis;closed-loop system;CLS;continuous detection intervals;denial-of-service attacks;dormant- attack intervals;feedback gain;H∞exponential stability;joint-design strategy;linear matrix inequalities;maximum allowable exponential decay rate;residual intervals;satellite control system;switched event-triggered H∞ security control approaches;three-mode switched system;three-piecewise Lyapunov function","","7","","59","IEEE","7 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

State transition analysis is a new approach to representing computer penetrations. In STAT, a penetration is identified as a sequence of state changes that take the computer system from some initial state to a target compromised state. The development of the first USTAT prototype, which is for SunOS 4.1.1, is discussed. USTAT makes use of the audit trails that are collected by the C2 basic security module of SunOS, and it keeps track of only those critical actions that must occur for the successful completion of the penetration.

Therefore, the use of reasonable spare inventory strategy, as well as maintenance and support decisions to systems is essential to improve system availability, security and system cost reducing. Maintenance strategy can be formulated based on the situation in which the products are monitored. For a single-component system, current research around its multi-state transferring have been quite mature, in which the conversion rate defined in a different state in Markov process can be clearly showed by conversion relationship between different state. However, the state transition process involved mostly considers the processes of repairing only, and rarely considers the impact to system availability by the transition of failure rate caused by changes in components, spare replacement strategies and spare supply. To solve this problem, this paper considered a single-component system with two derating states, and discussed its steady-state availability through variable spare replacement probability and different spare fill rate levels. With model of the system with two derating states established, generalized Markov method was used to solve the relationships between replacement timing and system availability with the level of spare fill rate considered. Finally, through the analysis of results, the preliminary conclusions were obtained. The results could clearly reveal the impacts of spare replacement strategy and spare fill rate in single-component system.","2166-5656","978-1-4799-7958-5","10.1109/PHM.2014.6988248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6988248","single-component;multi-states;replacment stategy;degradation system;system availability","Availability;Maintenance engineering;Steady-state;Markov processes;Equations;Mathematical model;Reliability engineering","cost reduction;inventory management;maintenance engineering;Markov processes","optimal replacement strategy;degradation system component;system availability;support process;equipment system;spare inventory strategy;turnaround time;product maintenance strategy;system support time;support decision;security;system cost reduction;single-component system;multistate transferring;Markov process;conversion relationship;state transition process;failure rate;spare replacement strategy;spare supply;steady-state availability;spare replacement probability;spare fill rate level;derating states;generalized Markov method;replacement timing","","","","8","IEEE","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies have revealed that control programs running on CPS devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g., code-injection or code-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks). Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime data-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics checking. In this work, we propose Orpheus, a new security methodology for defending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution semantics. We first present a general method for reasoning cyber-physical execution semantics of a control program (i.e., causal dependencies between the physical context/event and program control flows), including the event identification and dependence analysis. As an instantiation of Orpheus, we then present a new program behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton (eFSA). eFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of CPS control programs and incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented exploits if a specific physical event is missing along with the corresponding event dependent state transition. We evaluate our prototype's performance by conducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that eFSA can successfully detect different runtime attacks. Our prototype on Raspberry Pi incurs a low overhead, taking 0.0001s for each state transition integrity checking, and 0.063s~0.211s for the cyber-physical contextual consistency checking.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2019.2906161","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:ONR-N00014-17-1-2498); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:OAC-1541105); Security and Software Engineering Research Center; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8669815","Cyber-physical systems;data-oriented attacks;program anomaly detection;cyber-physical execution semantics","Runtime;Semantics;Anomaly detection;Sensors;Hidden Markov models;Security;Process control","cyber-physical systems;data integrity;finite state machines;program control structures;reasoning about programs;security of data","cyber-physical system security;malicious attacks;control-oriented attacks;code-reuse attacks;data-oriented attacks;noncontrol data attacks;runtime execution semantics checking;program control;event identification;dependence analysis;program behavior model;event-aware finite-state automaton;CPS control programs;event checking;physical event;runtime attacks;cyber-physical contextual consistency checking;event dependent state transition;cyber-physical execution semantics reasoning;runtime data-oriented exploit detection;event-aware program anomaly detection;code-injection attacks;Orpheus;causal dependencies;Raspberry Pi;state transition integrity checking","","17","","79","IEEE","19 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Accurate TTC values are acquired by identifying the transfer margin of these lines from their voltage stability limit, transient stability limit, as well as thermal limit with the outage schedules and load resource balance considered.","1944-9933","978-1-5090-4168-8","10.1109/PESGM.2016.7741831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7741831","Energy management;multi-time analysis;thermal limit constraint;total transfer capacity;transient/voltage stability constraint","Servers;Production;Energy management;Real-time systems;Manuals;Stability analysis;Thermal stability","energy management systems;load (electric);power engineering computing;power generation planning;power generation scheduling;power system security;power system transient stability;power transmission planning;power transmission reliability;voltage control","power transfer capacity calculator;energy management system;power system planning;power system operation;power system security;system reserves;limiting constraints;software solution;total transfer capacity calculator;EMS;TTC solutions;real-time mode;transfer margin identification;voltage stability limit;outage schedules;transient stability limit;load resource balance;thermal limit","","1","","9","IEEE","14 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of the Web architecture to guide our redesign and definition of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles.

The numerical comparisons show that the differences between the results calculated using the generalized n+2 state system model and three state component model are significant in some cases, particularly for high level outages, The generalized n+2 state system model is a more accurate model compared to the conventional three state model.

The importance of semantics is widely recognized, as well. Indeed, there exists several solutions to the problem of providing semantics to web services, most of them relies on some form of Description Logic. This paper presents an integration of model checking and semantic reasoning technologies in an efficient way. This can be considered the first step towards the usage of semantic model checking in problems of security verification. The approach relies on a representation of services at the process level that is based on semantically annotated state transition systems (ASTS) and a representation of specifications that is based on a semantically annotated version of the computation tree logic (AnCTL). The proposed approach permit to perform an efficient and yet useful, semantic reasoning at process-level about web services. Indeed, this paper proves that model checking for ASTS and AnCTL is sound and complete and it can be accomplished in polynomial time.","","978-1-4244-6830-0","10.1109/HPCS.2010.5547125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5547125","Semantic Web Service;State Transition System;Temporal Description Logic;Model Checking","Web services;Semantics;Authentication;Ontologies;Companies;Semantic Web","formal specification;formal verification;security of data;temporal logic;Web services","semantic model checking;security requirements;Web services;formal verification method;description logic;semantic annotated state transition systems;specification representation;computation tree logic","","2","","27","IEEE","12 Aug 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In simple terms, DT is described as a virtual replica of a given physical product, system, or process. It consists of three major segments: the physical entity, its virtual counterpart, and the connections between them. While the data is collected from a physical entity, processed at the virtual layer, and accessed in the form of a DT at the application layer, it is exposed to several security risks. To ensure the applicability of a DT system, it is imperative to understand these security risks and their implications. However, there is a lack of a framework that can be used to assess the security of a DT. This paper presents a framework in which the security of a DT can be analyzed with the help of a formal verification technique. The framework captures the defense of the system at different layers and considers various attacks at each layer. The security of the DT system is represented as a state-transition system and the security properties are captured in temporal logic. Probabilistic model checking (PMC) is used to verify the systems against these properties. In particular, the framework is used to analyze the probability of success and the cost of various potential attacks that can occur at each layer in a DT system.

Multipath execution is designed and implemented to achieve not only randomness of memory layout and diversity of binary files, but also randomness of program code paths executed, which is unique in our work.

The security of ICS has drawn the attention of many researchers since successful cyber-attacks against ICS can cause extensive damage in the physical world. Most of the existing literature describes solutions to protect an ICS against attacks directly targeting its underlying IT infrastructure. However, there are comparatively less works that focus on detecting cyber attacks against the physical process itself. Detection mechanisms that do so are said to be process aware. In this paper, we propose a time-based process aware intrusion detection system (IDS) that detects attacks against a physical process by leveraging its regular nature and temporal properties. The IDS learns the temporal behavior of the process variables and uses it to detect attacks. We evaluate the performance of our IDS on a public SCADA dataset and on a simulated SCADA system developed as part of this study, and we compare it with two other process-aware IDS proposed in the literature. The results show that our solution is able to detect attacks that are not detected by IDS that ignore temporal properties.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3213080","SPW Recherche Program of Wallonia, Belgium, through Win2Wal Project PrEDICT(grant numbers:211012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9913986","Anomaly detection;ICS;IDS;intrusion detection;process awareness;SCADA;temporal modeling","Integrated circuits;Process control;Anomaly detection;Monitoring;Behavioral sciences;Actuators;Intrusion detection","computer crime;control engineering computing;process control;production engineering computing;SCADA systems","temporal properties;temporal behavior;state transitions;control physical processes;cyberattack detection;time-based process aware intrusion detection system;SCADA dataset;industrial control system monitor;IT infrastructure;time-based process aware IDS","","","","34","CCBY","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the growing interaction between the modern ICS and the Internet has made ICS more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In order to protect ICS from malicious attacks, intrusion detection technology emerges. By analyzing the network meta data or the industrial process data, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can identify attacks that violate communication protocols or system specifications. However, the existing intrusion detection technology is not omnipotent, which opens up a back door for some more advanced attacks. In this work, we design an enhanced multi-stage semantic attack against ICS, which is undetectable by existing IDS. By hijacking the communication channels between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the remote Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), the attacker can manipulate the measurement data and control instructions simultaneously. The fake measurement data deceives the human operator into making wrong decisions. Furthermore, the attacker can strategically manipulate the semantic meaning of control instructions according to system state transition rules. In the meanwhile, a fake view of measurement data is presented to the HMI to conceal the on-going malicious attack. This attack is totally stealthy since the message sizes and timing, the command sequences, and the system state values are all legitimate. Consequently, this attack can secretly bring the system into critical states. Experimental results have verified the strong attack ability of the proposed attack.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949645","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802016,61702506); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0802805); National Social Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:17ZDA331); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018M641198); Northwestern Polytechnical University(grant numbers:FRF-BD-18-016A); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8883158","Industrial control systems;multi-stage semantic attacks;state transition;stealthy attacks","Integrated circuits;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Semantics;Industrial control","computer network security;control engineering computing;critical infrastructures;industrial control;Internet;production engineering computing;programmable controllers","enhanced multistage semantic attack;industrial control systems;modern ICS;malicious attack;network meta data;industrial process data;Intrusion Detection Systems;advanced attacks;control instructions;fake measurement data;system state transition rules;system state values;strong attack ability;remote programmable logic controllers","","7","","43","CCBY","25 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These devices are utilized to maintain system security in normal and contingency states, where corrective and preventive controls are implemented for the contingency cases. Load shedding and fast VAR devices are used in the corrective state in order to quickly restore system stability even though they are expensive, while cheap slow VAR devices can be used in the preventive state to obtain the desired security level. The main objective of this paper is to make a trade-off between economy and security by determining the optimal combination of fast and slow controls (load shedding, new slow and fast VAR devices). To meet the desired security limits, a variety of constraints have to be considered during the investigated transitions states. The proposed RPP problem is a combinatorial optimization problem, which cannot be solved easily by conventional optimization methods. Swarm optimization methods are reported to be efficient to solve combinatorial optimization problems. This paper discovers the efficiency of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Evolutionary PSO (EPSO) in solving the proposed RPP problem.

Likewise, many security solutions now exist within SDN environments for detecting and blocking clients who violate network policies. However, many of these solutions stop at triggering the security measure and give little thought to amending it. As a consequence, once the violation is addressed, no clear path exists for reinstating the flagged client beyond having the network operator reset the controller or manually implement a state change via an external command. This presents a burden for the network and its clients and administrators. Hence, we present a security policy transition framework for revoking security measures in an SDN environment once said measures are activated.","","978-1-5090-0933-6","10.1109/NFV-SDN.2016.7919476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7919476","Security Policy Transitions;Software Defined Networks;SDN;Network Operating System;NOS;Network Security Policies;Network Access Control;NAC;RYU;Ryuretic","Software;Access control;Ports (Computers);Kinetic theory;Monitoring","computer network security;software defined networking","security policy transition framework;software defined networks;programming frameworks;network application development;SDN environments;external command","","5","","17","IEEE","8 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach is based on a probabilistic extension of the value-passing Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS), which is a common formal language for modeling concurrent systems. Our approach gives a uniform security model for different security scenarios. We present then a uniform algorithm for computing the Nash equilibria strategies on this security model. In a nutshell, the algorithm first generates a network state transition graph for our security model, then simplifies this transition graph through graph-theoretic abstraction and bisimulation minimization. Then, a backward induction method, which is only applicable to finite tree models, can be used to compute all the Nash equilibria strategies of the (possibly infinite) security models. This algorithm is implemented and can be tuned smoothly for computing its social optimal strategies, and its termination and correctness are proved. The effectiveness and efficiency of this approach are demonstrated with two detailed examples from the field of network security.","2324-9013","978-1-5090-3205-1","10.1109/TrustCom.2016.0078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7846961","Network security;Nash equilibria strategies;Formal method;Probabilistic value-passing CCS","Security;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic;Communication networks;Reactive power;Games;Analytical models","calculus of communicating systems;computer network security;formal languages;game theory","modelling;network security scenarios;game theory;network security games;probabilistic extension;value-passing calculus of communicating systems;CCS;formal language;concurrent systems;uniform security models;Nash equilibria strategies;network state transition graph;graph-theoretic abstraction;bisimulation minimization;backward induction method;finite tree models","","1","","23","IEEE","9 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As one successful method, state transition (ST) analysis models penetrations as a series of state changes that lead from initial state to a target compromised state. Using this model of recomposing the ST method to solve the low recognizing ratio problem is presented in this paper. In this model, ST method can be expressed in a double DNA chains pattern. One chain is the system state chain; the other is an action chain. The double twisting chains form a state-action sequence to represent the system state transitions.

Furthermore, the unique software architecture of a bare PC enables the TLS, TCP, and application protocols to be intertwined, thereby reducing the communication overhead compared to that of a conventional system. As an example, we give details of the internal architecture of a bare PC TLS Web server. We then illustrate intertwining of the TLS, TCP, and HTTP protocols.

Recent trends of IP piracy and reverse-engineering are causing major revenue loss to the IP vendors. A large majority of hardware IPs comes in register transfer level (RTL) description due to their portability and flexibility to map to any technology platform. In this paper, we propose a key-based security through obscurity approach for protecting RTL hardware IPs. The RTL design is first transformed into a technology-independent gate-level description and the functionality of the resulting gate-level netlist is then changed through modification of its state transition function. This process allows normal operation only on the successful application of a correct initialization sequence. The modified gate-level design is then decompiled to generate an obfuscated version of the RTL. Major RTL constructs and macros are optionally preserved through the transformation process using a forward annotation file. The proposed methodology differs from existing hardware obfuscation as well as watermarking techniques in its ability to achieve simultaneous functional and semantic obfuscation for RTL description of IP at low design overhead. Simulation results for a set of open-source IP cores show that we can achieve high levels of security through a well-formulated obfuscation scheme incurring nominal area, delay and power overhead.","","978-1-4244-4805-0","10.1109/HST.2009.5224963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5224963","Hardware IP Protection;IP piracy;RTL obfuscation","Protection;Watermarking;Cryptography;Open source software;Reverse engineering;Hardware design languages;Design methodology;Computer security;Registers;System-on-a-chip","industrial property;integrated circuit design;reverse engineering;security of data;system-on-chip;watermarking","system-on-chip designs;register transfer level hardware IP;bug-free hardware intellectual property cores;IP piracy;reverse engineering;register transfer level description;key-based security;technology-independent gate-level description;watermarking techniques;correct initialization sequence","","23","4","13","IEEE","28 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As technology and grid infrastructure evolve to develop more advanced WAPAC applications, however, so do the attack surfaces in the grid infrastructure. This paper presents an attack-resilient system (ARS) for the WAPAC cybersecurity by seamlessly integrating the network intrusion detection system (NIDS) with intrusion mitigation and prevention system (IMPS). In particular, the proposed NIDS utilizes signature and behavior-based rules to detect attack reconnaissance, communication failure, and data integrity attacks. Further, the proposed IMPS applies state transition-based mitigation and prevention strategies to quickly restore the normal grid operation after cyberattacks. As a proof of concept, we validate the proposed generic architecture of ARS by performing experimental case study for wide-area protection scheme (WAPS), one of the critical WAPAC applications, and evaluate the proposed NIDS and IMPS components of ARS in a cyber-physical testbed environment. Our experimental results reveal a promising performance in detecting and mitigating different classes of cyberattacks while supporting an alert visualization dashboard to provide an accurate situational awareness in real-time.","","978-1-7281-8693-1","10.1109/RWS50334.2020.9241291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9241291","","Power system stability;Tools;Control systems;Real-time systems;Smart grids;Computer crime;Resilience","data integrity;energy management systems;power system control;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","intrusion mitigation;network intrusion detection system;WAPAC cybersecurity;attack-resilient system;attack surfaces;advanced WAPAC applications;grid infrastructure;system stability;wide-area communication network;energy management system;smart grid;control system;attack-resilient wide-area protection;critical WAPAC applications;wide-area protection scheme;normal grid operation;prevention strategies;state transition-based mitigation;data integrity attacks;attack reconnaissance;behavior-based rules;NIDS;prevention system","","3","","18","IEEE","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the adoption of wireless communication and network techniques, train control systems are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Notably, the jamming attacks, aiming at the handoff process that is the weakest part of train ground communication systems, will cause long disruption of communication. It will have a severe impact on train control operation efficiency. Current research regarding industry control system security is hard to model the impact of the jamming attacks on the train control system quantitatively, and current countermeasure schemes against jamming attacks are not designed for the operating mechanism of train control systems. This paper first builds the train control security state transition probability model under jamming attacks. A cross-layer defense scheme is then proposed from the aspect of the physical layer, the cyber layer and the management layer. In the physical layer, this paper designs a model prediction control algorithm to track dynamic target signals, in the hopes of eventually tracking the dynamic target quickly and smoothly. In the cyber layer, a multi-stage and zero-sum stochastic game model is built for the channel selection for the attack and the defense, whereby the channel selection randomized policy will be obtained. In the management layer, a dynamic train travel speed profile generation algorithm is proposed to mitigate the jamming attacks’ impact on train control systems. Extensive simulation results are shown that jamming attack impact on CBTC can be mitigated effectively with our proposed cross-layer defense scheme.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3005931","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2018JBM076); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973026); Beijing Municipal Education Commission Funding(grant numbers:I20H100010,I19H100010); Beijing Science and Technology Commission Funding(grant numbers:Z191100010818001); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L181004); Project(grant numbers:RCS2019ZT010,RCS2018K008,2018JBZ002); Beijing Traffic Control Technology (BJTCT) Innovation Funding(grant numbers:9907006509); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142439","Communication-based train control (CBTC);security;cross-layer defense;stochastic game","Jamming;Games;Security;Control systems;Physical layer;Stochastic processes;Communication systems","jamming;mobility management (mobile radio);predictive control;railway communication;railway engineering;stochastic games;target tracking;telecommunication security;wireless channels","cross-layer defense methods;jamming-resistant CBTC systems;communication-based train control systems;jamming attacks;train ground communication systems;train control operation efficiency;train control security state transition probability model;cross-layer defense scheme;physical layer;cyber layer;management layer;model prediction control algorithm;dynamic train travel speed profile generation algorithm;industry control system security;handoff process;zero-sum stochastic game model","","37","","42","IEEE","16 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The authors analyze the TCP code via a ""reverse engineering"" technique called ""program slicing"" to identify several of these vulnerabilities, especially those that are related to the TCP state-transition diagram. They discuss many of the flaws present in the TCP implementation of many widely used operating systems, such as SUNOS 4.1.3, SVR4, and ULTRIX 4.3. The corresponding TCP attack ""signatures"" (including the well-known 1994 Christmas Day Mitnick Attack) are described, and recommendations are provided to improve the security state of a TCP-based system (e.g., incorporation of a ""timer escape route"" from every TCP state).

Various security mechanisms employed in the network does not give the complete picture of security of complete network. In this paper we have proposed taxonomy and ontology which may be used to infer impact of various events happening in the network on security status of the network. Vulnerability, Network and Attack are the main taxonomy classes in the ontology. Vulnerability class describes various types of vulnerabilities in the network which may in hardware components like storage devices, computing devices or networks devices. Attack class has many subclasses like Actor class which is entity executing the attack, Goal class describes goal of the attack, Attack mechanism class defines attack methodology, Scope class describes size and utility of the target, Automation level describes the automation level of the attack Evaluation of security status of the network is required for network security situational awareness. Network class has network operating system, users, roles, hardware components and services as its subclasses. Based on this taxonomy ontology has been developed to perceive network security status.

SIP being a text-based protocol is vulnerable to a range of denial of service (DoS) attacks. These DoS attacks can render the SIP servers/SIP proxy servers unusable by depleting memory and CPU time. In this paper, we consider two types of DoS attacks, namely, flooding attacks and coordinated attacks for detection. Flooding attacks affect both stateless and stateful SIP servers while coordinated attacks affect stateful SIP servers. We model the SIP operation as discrete event system (DES) and design a new state transition machine, which we name as probabilistic counting deterministic timed automata (PCDTA) to describe the behavior of SIP operations. We also identify different types of anomalies that can occur in a DES model, which appear in the form of illegal transitions, violating timing constraints, and appear in number which is otherwise not seen. Subsequently, we map various DoS attacks in SIP to a type of anomaly in DES. PCDTA can learn probabilities of various transitions and timings delay from a set of nonmalicious training sequences. A trained PCDTA can detect anomalies, and hence various DoS attacks in SIP. We perform a thorough experiment with computer simulated SIP traffic and report the detection performance of PCDTA on various attacks generated through custom scripts.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2016.2632071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755836","Communication system security;Computer security;Network security","Servers;Computer crime;Discrete-event systems;Registers;Protocols;Authentication;Floods","computer network security;discrete event systems;Internet telephony;probabilistic automata;signalling protocols","anomalous behavior detection;VoIP systems;discrete event system modeling;session initiation protocol;application layer protocol;voice over IP connections;DoS attacks;flooding attacks;coordinated attacks;stateless SIP servers;stateful SIP servers;DES;state transition machine;probabilistic counting deterministic timed automata;PCDTA","","21","","41","IEEE","23 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Various security solutions have been proposed and implemented to protect users' data from unknown threats. Majority of these solutions are realized employing traditional networking techniques that are complex and extremely difficult to manage. These techniques rely on manual configuration of devices resulting in policy conflicts, which may compromise the network security. This issue can be addressed by adopting Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm which provides a network-wide visibility, centralized control, flexible network architecture and ease of management, by separating control plane (network controller) and the data plane (forwarding devices). The controller monitors, manages and controls the behaviour of the forwarding devices using OpenFlow protocol.

In particular, the adopted security protection mechanisms often depend on the node state, location, and/or surrounding risk, which need the capability of context-aware security quantification. This paper views the security level as a user's inherent property that is only correlated with the user's behaviours and the situated context and independent of the suffered attack ways. We propose a formalized methodology to especially quantify the security level in real time from the perspective of state transition probability through estimating the stable probability of staying in the security state in inhomogeneous continuous time Markov chain.

FSMs should be accurately extracted for watermark insertion, fault injection assessment of control paths in a system-on-chip (SoC), information leakage assessment, control-flow reverse engineering in RTL abstraction, logic obfuscation, etc. However, it is quite unfortunate that, as of today, existing state-of-the-art synthesis tools cannot provide accurate and reliable extraction of all FSMs from the provided high-level RTL code. Precise identification of all FSM state registers and the pure combinational state transition logic described in the RTL code with numerous registers and other combinational logic makes it quite challenging to develop such a solution. In this paper, we propose a framework named RTL-FSMx to extract FSMs from high-level RTL codes written in Verilog HDL. RTL-FSMx utilizes node-based analysis on the abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the RTL code to isolate FSM state registers from other registers. RTL-FSMx automatically extracts state transition graphs (STGs) for each of the detected FSM state registers and additional information of the extracted FSMs. Experimental results on a large number of benchmark circuits demonstrate that RTL-FSMx accurately recovers all control FSMs from RTL codes with various complexity and size within just a few seconds.","2378-2250","978-1-6654-6270-9","10.1109/ITC50671.2022.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9983935","Register Transfer Level;FSM Extraction;HDL Code Analysis;Security Assessment;FSM Automata Theory","Codes;Automata;Watermarking;Benchmark testing;Very large scale integration;Registers;Complexity theory","finite state machines;graph theory;hardware description languages;logic design;reverse engineering;system-on-chip","accurate extraction;accurate finite state machine extraction;control FSMs;control-flow reverse engineering;detected FSM state registers;extracted FSMs;fault injection assessment;finite state machines;high-level RTL code;information leakage assessment;precise extraction;pure combinational state transition logic;register-transfer level description;reliable extraction;RTL abstraction;RTL-FSMx utilizes;security vulnerability assessment solutions;state transition graphs;state-of-the-art synthesis tools","","","","68","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A resilient hybrid control scheme is proposed to mitigate the impact of these cyber-attacks. It is shown that the proposed resilient hybrid control scheme is able to estimate the switching attack signal and guarantee the attack mitigation under the assumptions that the discrete states of the hybrid system are distinguishable and the switching attack signal satisfies the average dwell-time condition.","2576-2370","978-1-7281-1398-2","10.1109/CDC40024.2019.9028878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028878","","Switches;Barium;Trajectory;Generators;Security;Mathematical model","continuous systems;control engineering computing;control system synthesis;cyber-physical systems;discrete systems;linear systems;security of data","CPS security related problems;cyber-attacks;hidden mode switched linear systems;discrete state dynamics;continuous state dynamics;resilient hybrid control scheme;switching attack signal;attack mitigation;resilient control design;bounded data injection attacks;cyber-physical systems;switching injection attacks;hybrid system approach","","2","","15","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Now electric supply industries are undergoing restructuring and deregulation, and the operation modes are getting more complicated, electric components are operating near to their security limits along with the probability of fault increasing largely, and operation modes changing more frequently. Automatic fault section identification and expert-system-based switch operation instructing system are much helpful to improve the intelligent level of dispatching operation. At present automatic fault section identification system (AFSIS) as aided decision-making for the operators is put into the field, switch operation instructing system (SOIS) also does. But these systems almost belong to a single agent, with power systems rapidly expanding, they have exposed to some limits. On the basis of research on AFSIS and SOIS for many years, a multi-agent system (MAS) based dispatching operation instructing scheme is proposed in this paper. The cooperation between AFSIS and SOIS is the key problem to study. A task decomposing method based on structural property, and a hybrid coordination control strategy is presented. More researches are focused on MAS task decomposition, coordinated control, data share, communication implementation and MAS learning. A MAS-based dispatching operation instructing system (MASDOIS) is implemented and put into the field.

Our objective is to analyze the FCSNS security via the combination of model and state. This method represents the network structure and state transferring by way of Petri net. In addition, it introduces the security analysis method of STRIDE to build up the Attack tree model.

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach for event-sourcing in such systems, which allows for the reliable and transparent recording of events and state changes.

The performance of this model is favorable when the system operates in normal conditions but tends to suffer while the system state dramatically changes. Moreover, its accuracy and convergence is sensitive to the value of the process noise covariance matrix. The other subsystem, with some opposite characteristics, utilizes a pseudo-dynamic model derived from the linearization of the power flow equation. A switching rule based on the innovations is established to make a tradeoff between the two subsystems with regard to estimation accuracy, converge speed, and computing time. Apart from the difference in the reporting rate of various measurements, cyber attacks, such as DoS attacks may result in the absence of measurements in the snapshot of SE at the finest time scale. To deal with this problem, the linear extrapolation and multistep prediction techniques are involved.

Some previous studies have adopted formal methods, but their models cannot express parallel communication completely. This limitation gives rise to problems where web functions, such as a cache that stores contents, cannot be defined and attacks that forge contents cannot be analyzed. These problems are present in the Alloy-based implementations of current models that do not have the ability to express temporal logic. Therefore, we design implementation and evaluation of temporal logic in Alloy to express time series and parallel computation for web security analysis. In doing so, state transitions in the web can be expressed by fitting them in our proposed syntax. As concrete applications, we describe a web security model that includes caches and show that our proposed syntax can analyze state-of-the-art attacks, such as unauthorized access to users' account pages via caches.

In the proposed game model, the virus is supposed to propagate itself in a cyber network connecting cyber nodes belonging to power substations. Each cyber node may play as an attacker or a defender according to its state. A death-birth rule is adopted to model probabilistic strategies and state transfers, which reflects the bounded rationality of the viruses. Then, an evolution dynamic equation is derived to obtain the portion of the infected substations when the equilibrium is reached, and simulation algorithm is also given to estimate the infection probability of each substation under the persistent virus-based intrusion. Assuming a virus may trip all breakers in the infected substation, the cyber-security risk is evaluated to identify system-level vulnerabilities.

Recent studies have proven that delays in providing healthcare are directly linked to patient confidence and chances of recovery. An unreliable storage of health records has only aggravated the problem. Our paper aims to provide a solution for these issues by proposing a Blockchain-Internet of things model where a bio-sensor measures and collects real time data with respect to a patient's medical status and stores it in the blockchain. In this way quick reporting and tamper proof storage of data occurs. By deploying a smart contract the final hospital bill can be calculated along with insurance coverage. This would negate the need of third party providers and create a transparent system. Our paper also proposes the use of Inter planetary file system to store discharged patients records thus reducing the load on the actual blockchain.

By using HTTP, the development is simplified because it is not necessary to build an interface, API, or others for each system a developer need to build. The implemented system can issue a time-stamp about 1,140ms under the experimental environment.","","978-1-4673-3143-2","10.1109/ICCSCE.2012.6487179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487179","Time-Stamping;RFC3161;Trusted Platform Module;Offline-Type;Representational State Transfer","","document handling;Internet;security of data","offline time stamping system;time stamping services;document protection;Internet access;security chip;time stamping system;HTTP style","","","","16","IEEE","28 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a synergistic combination of Surrogate Augmented Lagrangian Relaxation and branch-and-cut is presented. With system coupling constraints relaxed and quadratic penalties on constraint violations added, the augmented Lagrangian is innovatively linearized and decomposed into subproblems to be solved by branch-and-cut. Subproblem solutions are then effectively coordinated based on Surrogate subgradients with much reduced computation requirements and multiplier zigzagging, and accelerated reduction of constraint violations.

Unfortunately, existing software and even hardware approaches for finding and identifying memory bugs have considerable performance overheads, target only a narrow class of bugs, are costly to implement, or use computational resources inefficiently. This paper describes MemTracker, a new hardware support mechanism that can be configured to perform different kinds of memory access monitoring tasks. MemTracker associates each word of data in memory with a few bits of state, and uses a programmable state transition table to react to different events that can affect this state. The number of state bits per word, the events to which MemTracker reacts, and the transition table are all fully programmable. MemTracker's rich set of states, events, and transitions can be used to implement different monitoring and debugging checkers with minimal performance overheads, even when frequent state updates are needed. To evaluate MemTracker, we map three different checkers onto it, as well as a checker that combines all three. For the most demanding (combined) checker, we observe performance overheads of only 2.7% on average and 4.8% worst-case on SPEC 2000 applications. Such low overheads allow continuous (always-on) use of MemTracker-enabled checkers even in production runs","2378-203X","1-4244-0804-0","10.1109/HPCA.2007.346205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147668","","Monitoring;Computer bugs;Hardware;Software debugging;Security;Software tools;Buffer overflow;Memory management;Software performance;Application software","checkpointing;program debugging;software metrics;storage management;system monitoring","MemTracker;memory access monitoring;memory access debugging;software complexity;programmable state transition table;monitoring checker;debugging checker","","81","2","24","IEEE","10 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

VFS policies aim at reducing the CPU energy, while DPM-based solutions involve putting the system components (e.g., memory or I/O devices) to low-power/sleep states at runtime, when sufficiently long idle intervals can be predicted. Despite numerous research papers that tackled the energy minimization problem using VFS or DPM separately, the interactions of these two popular techniques are not yet well understood. In this paper, we undertake an exact analysis of the problem for a real-time embedded application running on a VFS-enabled CPU and using multiple devices. Specifically, by adopting a generalized system-level energy model, we characterize the variations in different components of the system energy as a function of the CPU processing frequency. Then, we propose a provably optimal and efficient algorithm to determine the optimal CPU frequency as well as device state transition decisions to minimize the system-level energy. We also extend our solution to deal with workload variability. The experimental evaluations confirm that substantial energy savings can be obtained through our solution that combines VFS and DPM optimally under the given task and energy models.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2010.248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5669265","Real-time systems;energy management;voltage/frequency scaling;device power management.","Algorithm design and analysis;Throughput;Performance evaluation;Benchmark testing;Power demand;Quality of service;Security","embedded systems;power aware computing","voltage-frequency scaling;device power management;frame based real time embedded applications;CPU energy;power-sleep states;energy minimization problem;CPU processing frequency;device state transition decisions;system level energy","","74","","37","IEEE","17 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it will give attackers the possibility of discovering vulnerabilities in the system, and the control systems lack the ability of dynamic perception of security state and risk, causing the systems to be exposed to risks. In this article, a dynamic Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model is proposed. The conditional random field (CRF) is introduced into the BLP model to optimize the rules. First, the model formalizes the security attributes, states of system, transition rules, and constraint models on the basis of the state transition of CRFs. After the historical system access logs are processed as the original dataset, a feature selection method is proposed to extract the requests and current states as feature vectors. Second, this article presents a rules training algorithm based on L-BFGS to implement the study and training of datasets, and then marks the logs in the test set through Viterbi algorithm automatically. On the base of these, a rule generation algorithm is proposed to dynamically adjust the access control rules based on the current security status and events of the system. Third, the security of CRFs-BLP is proved by theoretical analysis. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the model are verified by estimating the value of the precision, recall, and F1-score.

Main application areas include vehicles or robots that need to collaborate to achieve a common task, e.g., minimize fuel consumption, moving objects at a construction site, or performing a set of operations in a factory. Moreover, these vehicles or robots need to interact and possibly collaborate with humans in a safe way, e.g., avoiding accidents or collisions, and prevent hazardous situations that may harm humans and/or machines. % This paper proposes a framework for developing safe and secure adaptive collaborative systems, with run-time guarantees.

Stimulation results on two test cases show that the dynamic profile of the cascading failures in the coupled system displays a “staircase-like” pattern, which can be interpreted as a combined feature of the typical step propagation profile triggered repeatedly by cyber attacks due to network coupling.

Existing studies about the security of SDN-enabled smart grid (SDSG) mainly focused on static methods such as access control and identity authentication, which is vulnerable to attackers that carefully probe the system. As the attacks become more variable and complex, there is an urgent need for dynamic defense methods. In this paper, we propose a security function virtualization (SFV) based moving target defense of SDSG which makes the attack surface constantly changing. First, we design a dynamic defense mechanism by migrating virtual security function (VSF) instances as the traffic state changes. The centralized SDN controller is re-designed for global status monitoring and migration management. Moreover, we formalize the VSF instances migration problem as an integer nonlinear programming problem with multiple constraints and design a pre-migration algorithm to prevent VSF instances' resources from being exhausted. Simulation results indicate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761217","","Security;Smart grids;Servers;Virtualization;Communication networks;Monitoring;Bandwidth","computer network security;integer programming;nonlinear programming;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids;software defined networking;virtualisation","security function virtualization;SDN-enabled smart grid;software-defined networking;dynamic defense methods;centralized SDN controller;moving target defense;virtual security function;integer nonlinear programming problem","","1","","27","IEEE","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is less efficient to fuzz the stateful protocols due to the difficulties like maintaining states and dependencies of messages. To address these challenges, we present SPFuzz, a framework for building flexible, coverage-guided stateful protocol fuzzing. We define a language in SPFuzz to describe the protocol specifications, protocol states transitions and dependencies for generating valuable test cases, maintaining correct messages in session states and handling protocol dependencies by updating message data in time. The SPFuzz adopts a three-level mutation strategy, namely head, content, and sequence mutation strategy to drive the fuzzing process to cover more paths, in conjunction with the method to randomly assign weights to messages and strategies. We use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of SPFuzz and other frameworks upon three protocol implementations, i.e., Proftpd, Oftpd, and OpenSSL, which are three-granularity coverages specifically function, basic block, and edge. In experiments, the SPFuzz framework outperforms the existing stateful protocol fuzzing tool Boofuzz by an average of 69.12% in three granularities coverage tests. This demonstrates that the SPFuzz has the ability to explore more and deeper paths of the target program. We further triggered CVE-2015-0291 in OpenSSL 1.0.2 with the SPFuzz, which proves the validity and utility of our framework.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2895025","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0200401); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; National High-level Personnel for Defense Technology Program(grant numbers:2017-JCJQ-ZQ-013); HUNAN Province Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017RS3045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8626141","AFL;coverage;fuzzing;network protocol;software security","Protocols;Fuzzing;Tools;Servers;Security;Schedules;Engines","program testing;protocols;telecommunication scheduling","hierarchical scheduling framework;stateful network protocol fuzzing;fuzzing technology;coverage improvement;target program;coverage-guided stateful protocol fuzzing;protocol specifications;protocol states transitions;correct messages;session states;handling protocol dependencies;message data;three-level mutation strategy;sequence mutation strategy;fuzzing process;protocol implementations;SPFuzz framework;granularities coverage tests;stateful protocol fuzzing tool Boofuzz","","14","","37","OAPA","25 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The CSCs possess several good properties such as simplicity, scalability, and efficiency in hardware. In the initial version of the CSC, the output of the last cell was directly used as the keystream. In this paper, we propose a backward state transition (BST) attack that exploits this structure and is able to break the cipher. To defeat the BST attack, two modifications of the CSC structure are proposed. In the modified CSC, outputs from two cells are combined, and the output of the last cell is used in a feedback loop.

Then, strategies of cyber attacker and defender can be studied, which help to identify substations vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In this paper, a successful intrusion is regarded as a probabilistic event related to reconnaissance activities. Its probability can be approximated by the Poisson distribution of the number of vulnerabilities discovered by the attacker. Furthermore, models of intrusion and defense in competition for control of the substations are proposed using Markov decision process (MDP). Key characteristics of target substation, attacker and defender are considered for determining probabilistic state transitions related to intrusion and defense actions. Thus, by solving the MDP models, the optimal strategies (action policies) of both the attacker and defender can be obtained. With these optimal strategies, the cyber security status of a substation can be evaluated within varied time frames.

In that case, we can move from trying to build the perfectly secure system to continue asking questions like “how much vulnerability do I have and what control do I need to be effective?” This paper proposes Security Chaos Engineering as a method to expose API vulnerabilities and enhance API security. RESTful API has gained popularity in recent years due to its reusability, flexibility and natural adaptation to modern web application, mobile application, and cloud computing. However, ensuring secure API/data access and hence mitigating reputational and/or financial damage to the organization is still in its early stage. Foundational security protection mechanisms include transport layer security, authentication / authorization of the consumer (either individual or application). To complete the spectrum of secure API access and provide advanced protection, there is much more to consider: mitigation of API specific vulnerabilities at design and implementation time. API Security using Chaos Engineering is an approach for learning about system security behavers when using APIs by applying empirical exploration. Security Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting to build confidence in the system’s security and see how a system can withstand threats in production. Security Chaos Engineering isn’t about creating chaos.

Unfortunately, as of today, there are no good solutions available that can provide very fast and accurate extraction of FSMs from the flattened netlist to perform effective security assessment. The difficulty of developing such a solution lies in precisely identifying FSM state flip-flops present in a netlist that contains numerous circuit flip-flops. In this paper, we propose to develop a framework called FSMx to extract FSMs from highly unstructured synthesized designs. FSMx utilizes graph theory to identify FSM state registers from other registers. FSMx automatically extracts gate-level state transition graphs (STGs) for each of the detected FSM state registers. Experimental results demonstrate that FSMx efficiently recovers FSMs from synthesized netlists with various complexity and size in less than 7 minutes in the worst case of NIST AES 128-bit design with 12,976 gates on a personal desktop.","2375-1053","978-1-6654-1060-1","10.1109/VTS52500.2021.9794151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9794151","FSM Extraction;Flattened Gate-Level Netlist Analysis;Security Validation;FSM Automata Theory","Reverse engineering;Automata;Watermarking;Logic gates;Very large scale integration;NIST;Graph theory","cryptography;finite state machines;flip-flops;graph theory;logic design;reverse engineering;security of data;system-on-chip","gate-level state transition graphs;detected FSM state registers;FSMx;synthesized netlists;finite state machine extraction;flattened netlist;security vulnerability assessments;fast extraction;finite state machines;watermark insertion;FSM-based logic locking;fault injection assessment;control paths;information leakage assessment;effective security assessment;numerous circuit;highly unstructured synthesized designs;time 7.0 min","","","","41","IEEE","15 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, the 5G system, state transition properties and security properties were abstracted from 3GPP specifications. To mimic an attacker’s behavior, a Dolev-Yao adversary model was constructed in the 5G model by empowering it with NAS signalling security testing knowledge and reasonable security capabilities in the wireless channel. Then we used the TAMARIN prover to verify all the abstracted properties one by one and discovered some protocol vulnerabilities based on the counterexamples found. We further verified these vulnerabilities on the testbed and identified 10 new 5G protocol vulnerabilities. Moreover, we analyzed the root cause of these vulnerabilities and concluded that all of them were caused by the unconditional trust between UE and gNodeB. Therefore, we propose an improved PKI mechanism based on the existing asymmetric encryption of 5G.

The traditional security mechanisms such as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is no longer as feasible in protecting WSN as in wired networks. The new concept of trust has emerged in recent studies as an alternative mechanism to address the security concerns in WSNs. Most recent studies on trust are mainly focused on how to model and evaluate trust so as to effectively detect, isolate, and avoid any malicious activity in the network. In this paper, we have introduced the new angle of adaptive network approach to study 'dynamics on networks' i.e., trust state transition on a network with a fixed topology or 'dynamics of networks' i.e., topological transformation of a network with no dynamic trust state changes separately so as to discover the interplay between network overlay entities' trust evaluation and its underlie topological connectivity. Inspired from the trust studies in sociology, we propose that the Simmelian tie structured networks enable more positive impact on fostering trustworthiness among sensor nodes, while structural hole characterized networks provide more opportunity for misbehaviors and have negative impact to secure WSNs. These hypothesis have been confirmed by the extensive simulation studies.","","978-1-4673-7952-6","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345270","Security;Wireless sensor networks;Trust and reputation management;Adaptive networks;Topological metrics;Simmelian tie and structural hole","Wireless sensor networks;Network topology;Measurement;Security;Adaptive systems;Topology;Sociology","public key cryptography;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Simmelian tie structured networks;structural holes;topological roles;trust formation;wireless sensor network security;WSN;open-access;error-prone wireless environments;public key infrastructure;PKI;wired networks;adaptive network approach;trust state transition;fixed topology;network dynamics;topological transformation;underlie topological connectivity;sociology","","1","","27","IEEE","3 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The amount of stored information is so huge that it is highly difficult to manage the content especially in a distributed cloud environment. There are many open source software solutions available in cloud to handle huge amount of digital data. However none of these solutions addresses all the requirements needed to manage the content spread out in multiple systems effectively. The user has to relay on multiple content management systems to do the work. This turns into ever more unwieldy, time consuming and leads to loss of data. Using robust and integrated content management systems, these issues could be solved effectively. In this paper we have identified various challenges of using the content management system in the cloud after surveying many Content Management System related article and proposed an integrated solution named Cloud based Architecture integrating Content Management System which is capable of interfacing with various unique features available at different content management system installations in the cloud. This maximizes the functionality and performance of any Content management systems. The Representational State Transfer (REST) protocol is used to integrate the best features of various open source content management systems. REST provides higher level of security compared to existing systems as it does not store the user sessions. The users can interact with the system with the help of an interface which abstracts the complexities of multiple content management systems running in the cloud.","","978-1-5090-5960-7","10.1109/ICIMIA.2017.7975631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975631","CMS;Open Source;Cloud;REST;PhP;MYSQL;Web Services","Content management;Cloud computing;Security;Organizations;Tools;Computer architecture","cloud computing;content management;data handling;public domain software;security of data","cloud based architecture;digital content;distributed cloud environment;open source software;digital data handling;Representational State Transfer protocol;REST protocol;open source content management systems;security","","","","15","IEEE","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Security is important for communication over the network and to provide security one can use encryption methods which are implemented in Representational State Transfer (REST) API authentication. Message Digest 5 (MD5) and Secure Hashing Algorithm 1 (SHA1) encryption are algorithms that are often used in this case. This study aims to examine the performance of the two algorithms. The Wireshark application is used to retrieve authentication data. Authentication data is still encrypted, then tested by Brute Force Attack using Hashcat tools. In addition, each algorithm is measured in terms of the time needed for the REST API Authentication process, which uses the Postman application. Based on Brute Force Attack testing the SHA1 encryption algorithm has the advantage of being stronger, but the time needed for encryption is slower when compared to the MD5 algorithm. Even though it's more tethered, the difference in encryption time needed is only 37.1 ms, so that SHA1 is still considered relevant for implementing security systems and REST API authentication on a mobile application.","","978-1-7281-1655-6","10.1109/ICOIACT46704.2019.8938570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8938570","Authentication;MD5;Mobile Data Security;Rest API;SHA1","Authentication;Encryption;Servers;Force;Testing","application program interfaces;client-server systems;cryptography;message authentication","authentication data;Brute Force Attack;REST API Authentication process;Postman application;SHA1 encryption algorithm;MD5 algorithm;encryption time;security systems;mobile application;SHA1 algorithms;mobile-based Application;mobile-based applications;client-server system;encryption methods;wireshark application;representational state transfer API authentication;Client-Server system;encrypt REST API authentication;time 37.1 ms","","1","","17","IEEE","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This type of storage has several issues, such as privacy and data integrity, because several parties will fully regulate privacy and data integrity. Therefore, a data storage system is needed that can provide privacy, security, and data integrity to maintain the authenticity of sensitive data. This study wants to develop to implement blockchain technology to store employee attendance data from the HR department in a company. Employee attendance data is taken from the Angular web application integrated with a permissioned blockchain framework called Hyperledger Composer. This study chose Hyperledger Composer because this type of blockchain has a fast validation time. Hyperledger Composer has a Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API) named composer-rest-server, which allows Hyperledger blockchain to interact with other components. The implementation results show that Hyperledger Composer can be functionally used as data storage for the attendance management and Payroll system. In addition, Hyperledger Composer performance is measured by evaluating block transaction times. The evaluation of the Hyperledger Composer is done in three ways: directly within the Hyperledger Composer, using the Angular web application through the REST API, and using JMeter through the REST API. As a result, testing for making transaction blocks varies from 1 - 17ms on an experiment directly in Hyperledger Composer, 5 - 296ms through the REST API using JMeter tools, and 1 - 4270ms through the Angular Web Application. The result shows that the performance of the REST API produced by the composer-rest-server is recorded faster than Ethereum. With these results, composer-rest-server can handle systems that require fast transaction times, such as voting systems, health monitoring, and the Internet of Things (IoT) application, because the average time to conduct transactions is still under one second. Thus, Hyperledger as attendance data storage can provide privacy and data integrity.","2642-6102","978-1-6654-6658-5","10.1109/TENSYMP54529.2022.9864383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9864383","blockchain;Hyperledger;composer-rest-server;attendance;REST API","Data privacy;Distributed ledger;Data integrity;Memory;Companies;Blockchains;Representational state transfer","application program interfaces;data integrity;data privacy;human resource management;Internet;payroll data processing;transaction processing;Web services","blockchain-based attendance management;payroll system;data integrity;data storage system;employee attendance data;Angular web application;representational state transfer application programming interface;REST API;hyperledger blockchain;hyperledger composer;attendance data storage;block transaction times;JMeter;data privacy;time 1.0 ms to 17.0 ms;time 5.0 ms to 296.0 ms;time 1.0 ms to 4270.0 ms","","","","13","IEEE","29 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two new technologies make this scaling possible without any virtualization software: 1) self-transition management and 2) unified virtual address mapping. Evaluations show that this domain control provides highly scalable performance and incurs almost no performance overhead in security domains. The increase in binary code size is less than 40KB, and the time required for individual state transitions is of a single-millisecond order.

The emergence of high-speed networks in electric power systems creates a tight interaction of cyberinfrastructure with the physical infrastructure and makes the power system susceptible to cyber penetration and attacks. To address this problem, this paper proposes an innovative approach to develop a specification-based intrusion detection framework that leverages available information provided by components in a contemporary power system. An autoencoder is used to encode the causal relations among the available information to create patterns with temporal state transitions, which are used as features in the proposed intrusion detection.

Different from previous approaches where DSU is described from the viewpoint of program's internal state transitions, our framework focuses on program's external behavior and its effect on its environment. This more abstract view avoids over specification of DSU and allows for better DSU flexibility.

In this paper, we establish a zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model, that can be used for designing defense policies for cyber-physical systems against attackers of different types. The hybrid game model contains physical states described by the system dynamics, and a cyber state that represents the detection mode of the system. A system selects a subsystem by combining one controller, one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at each state. In order to provide scalable and real-time computation of the switching strategies, we propose a moving-horizon approach to solve the zero-sum hybrid stochastic game, and obtain a saddle-point equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control cost. This approach leads to a real-time algorithm that yields a sequence of Nash equilibrium strategies which can be shown to converge.

The communication in the e-governance platform and many data exchange systems alike, such as health information exchange systems, usually depends on the interoperability of the platforms achieved with platform-independent architectures and protocol such as Representational State Transfer (REST), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) or Application Programming Interface (APIs), which is an important building block for developing distributed applications, published as web services over an Intranet or the Internet. However, in most interoperability or integrations of systems, the interfacing component of the integration has been regarded as the most likely to be the weak link in terms of vulnerabilities [4].

The concept of resilience is introducing to measure the ability of the system to maintain its function under attack. It matters in evaluating the security of modern industrial systems. This paper presents a 3D Resilience State Space method to assess Communication-based train control (CBTC) system resilience under malware attack. We model the spread of malware as two functions: the communicability function $f$(x) and the susceptibility function 9 (x). We describe the characteristics of these two function in the CBTC complex network by using the percolation theory. Then we use a perturbation formalism to analyze the impact of malware attack on information flow and use it as an indicator of the cyber layer state. The CBTC cyber-physical system resilience metric formalizes as the system state transitions in three-dimensional state space. The three dimensions respectively represent the cyber layer state, the physical layer state, and the transmission layer state. The simulation results reveal that the proposed framework can effectively assess the resilience of the CBTC system. And the anti-malware programs can prevent the spread of malware and improve CBTC system resilience.","","978-1-7281-9142-3","10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564448","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9564448","","Fault tolerance;Three-dimensional displays;Simulation;Resists;Control systems;Malware;State-space methods","complex networks;computer network security;invasive software;railway communication;state-space methods","three-dimension resilience state space-based approach;passive defense methods;communication-based train control system resilience;cyber-physical system resilience metric formalizes;CBTC system resilience;anti-malware programs;transmission layer state;physical layer state;system state transitions;cyber layer state;CBTC complex network;susceptibility function;communicability function;malware attack;industrial systems;cyber attacks","","","","18","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a novel methodology based on transfer learning is proposed for real-time post-contingency transient stability prediction to overcome the difficulties about the long training times of these classifiers. In the proposed method, first, a small dataset which contains only the three-phase fault contingencies for various operating points is selected to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, and then, an additional dataset which involves two-phase-to-ground fault scenarios is used to update the trained CNN using the transfer learning approach instead of retraining the model from ground up.

To bypass the network security devices such as firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) and web application firewall, attackers use evasive techniques to circumvent them, of which protocol mimicry is a very useful approach. The technique camouflages malicious communications as common protocols or generally innocent applications to avoid network security audit, which has been widely used in advanced Trojans, botnets, as well as anonymous communication systems, bringing a great challenge to current network management and security. To this end, we propose a general network protocol mimicry behavior discovery framework named MimicHunter to detect such evasive masquerade behaviors, which exploits protocol structure and state transition verifications, as well as primary protocol behavior elements. Experiment results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in practice. Besides, MimicHunter is flexible in deployment and can be easily implemented in passive detection systems with only a little cost compared with the active methods.","","978-1-4673-7952-6","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345292","protocol mimicry;intrusion detection;evasive attack;protocol structure;state transition","Protocols;MIMICs;Payloads;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Malware","security of data","MimicHunter framework;passive network protocol mimicry detection framework;network based intrusion;information theft events;network security devices;firewall;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;IDS-IPS;Web application firewall;evasive techniques;network security audit","","1","","31","IEEE","3 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the associated goals of an ultimate quality-of-service (QoS) that support real-time and mission-critical applications, along with utmost security and reliability, remain elusive. This paper describes a fundamental technological advance that not only attains ideal QoS with unique security and reliability capabilities but also supports full interworking with traditional IP networks, inasmuch as it does not require modification (e.g., labeling) or higher-layer/proprietary interpretation of IP packets. We describe an advanced wide-area network composed of traditional end-points, dual-mode switch/routers, and sequencing agents that provide per-flow admission and scheduling of packets on a link-by-link basis from source to destination. The network is fully scalable and can readily provide reachability across multiple domains that span the globe. Sequencing agents assure an individual, time-deterministic path for every critical application-i.e., those that require minimal transport delay (i.e., no packet queueing), no jitter and no packet loss. Moreover, since sequencing is accomplished on a per-flow basis and invokes a temporal paradigm for packet switching, we show that applications are completely immune to extraneous network influences, notably network congestion or Denial-of-Service attacks. As discussed in this paper, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment realization has demonstrated these attributes for both customary realtime flows (examples of which include voice- and video-over-IP) and sequenced TCP flows. The latter is especially significant, in that it makes possible for the first time a system for fully managed and guaranteed throughput of TCP data while maximizing goodput, a significant advance for reliable, deterministic, secure data transmission and networked storage. This paper further makes clear that traditional end-points (e.g., videoconferencing units and IP phones) can readily operate in packet-sequenced networks. Moreover, we note that the sequencing protocol permits per-flow reuse of preallocated-but unused-throughput. Consequently, nonsequenced packets (e.g., best-effort, asynchronous data) are ""backfilled"" and amenable to conventional routing in either sequenced networks or interconnected, conventional IP networks, thereby providing facile interworking with the large embedded base of legacy IP equipment.","","0-7803-8140-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290287","","Wide area networks;Packet switching;IP networks;Switches;Web and internet services;Quality of service;Mission critical systems;Data security;Labeling;Delay","IP networks;packet switching;transport protocols;computer network management;computer network reliability;Internet;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic;quality of service","Internet;converged IP infrastructure;quality-of-service;QoS;reliability;wide-area network;WAN;dual-mode switch;routers;packet switching;network congestion;denial-of-service;commercial-off-the-shelf;COTS equipment;TCP flows;secure data transmission;packet-sequenced networks;sequencing protocol","","1","","7","IEEE","4 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DPI aims to identify various malware (including spam and viruses) by inspecting both the header and the payload of each packet and comparing it to a known set of patterns. DPI is often performed on the critical path of the packet processing, thus the overall performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of DPI. The seminal algorithm of Aho-Corasick (AC) is the de facto standard for pattern matching in network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Basically, the AC algorithm constructs a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) for detecting all occurrences of a given set of patterns by processing the input in a single pass. The input is inspected symbol by symbol (usually each symbol is a byte), such that each symbol results in a state transition. Thus, in principle, the AC algorithm has deterministic performance, which does not depend on specific input and therefore is not vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks, making it very attractive to NIDS systems. In this paper we show that, when implementing the AC algorithm in software, this property does not hold, due to the fact that contemporary pattern sets induce very large DFAs that cannot be stored entirely in cache. We then propose a novel technique to compress the representation of the Aho-Corasick automaton, so it can fit in modern cache. We compare both the performance and the memory footprint of our technique to previously-proposed implementation, under various settings and pattern sets. Our results reveal the space-time tradeoffs of DPI. Specifically, we show that our compression technique reduces the memory footprint of the best prior-art algorithm by approximately 60%, while achieving comparable throughput.","2325-5560","978-1-4244-8456-0","10.1109/HPSR.2011.5985996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5985996","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Software algorithms;Encoding;Pattern matching;Software;Throughput","authorisation;computer networks;Internet","software-based deep;space-time tradeoffs;packet inspection;network intrusion detection;prevention systems;Web application firewalls;DPI;packet processing;deterministic finite automaton;state transition;algorithmic complexity attacks;NIDS systems;AC algorithm;Aho-Corasick automaton;compression technique","","14","2","25","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike a traditional point sensor, this type of sensor has a rectangular sensing region with a processor installed on it to do processing and communication. Like wireless sensor networks with point sensors, energy-efficient communication is still an important issue in wireless sensor networks with cable sensors because of the need to efficiently use limited resources. To address the issue, we propose a Cable Mode Transition (CMT) algorithm, which determines the minimal number of active sensors to maintain K-coverage of a terrain as well as K-connectivity of the network. Specifically, it allocates periods of inactivity for cable sensors without affecting the coverage and connectivity requirements of the network based only on local information. Before presenting CMT, we first show the relationship between coverage and connectivity, then the eligibility algorithm permitting a cable sensor to decide whether to stay active. CMT calls the eligibility algorithm to schedule cables. Simulation results show that our scheme is efficient in saving energy and thus can prolong the lifetime of wireless cable sensor networks.","1938-1883","978-1-61284-233-2","10.1109/icc.2011.5963077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963077","","Communication cables;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;IEEE Communications Society;Communication system security;Optical sensors","optical cables;wireless sensor networks","energy-efficient communication scheme;wireless cable sensor network;WSN;fiber optic cable sensor;rectangular sensing region;cable mode transition;CMT algorithm;k-coverage;k-connectivity;eligibility algorithm","","3","","6","IEEE","28 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent research has demonstrated the vulnerability of some feedback-control based applications to low-rate denial-of-service (LRDoS) attacks, which send high-intensity requests in an ON/OFF pattern to degrade the victim's performance and evade the detection designed for traditional DoS attacks. However, the intricate interaction between LRDoS attacks and the feedback control mechanism remains largely unknown. In this paper, we address two fundamental questions: 1) what is the impact of an LRDoS attack on a general feedback-control based system and 2) how to conduct a systematic evaluation of the impact of an LRDoS attack on specific feedback-control based systems. To tackle these problems, we model the system under attack as a switched system and then examine its properties. We conduct the first theoretical investigation on the impact of the LRDoS attack on a general feedback control system. We formally show that the attack can make the system's steady-state error oscillate along with the attack period, and prove the existence of LRDoS attacks that can force the system to be far off the desired state. In addition, we propose a novel methodology to systematically characterize the impact of an LRDoS attack on specific systems, and apply it to a web server and an IBM Notes server. This investigation obtains many new insights, such as new attack scenarios, the bound of the system's states, the relationship between the bound and the LRDoS attacks, the close-formed equations for quantifying the impact, and so on.

Most previous operational-based resilience enhancement methods have focused on corrective or restorative strategies during and after extreme events without proactively preparing the system for forecasted potential failures. Also, the propagation behavior of wildfires among system components induces further complexities resulting in a mathematically involved problem accompanied with many modeling challenges. During sequential failures, operators need to make decisions in a fast-paced manner to maintain reliable operation and avoid cascading failures and blackouts. Thereby, the complexity of decision processes increases dramatically during extreme weather events. This article proposes a probabilistic proactive generation redispatch strategy to enhance the operational resilience of power grids during wildfires. A Markov decision process is used to model system state transitions and to provide generation redispatch strategies for each possible system state given component failure probabilities, wildfire spatiotemporal properties, and load variation. For a realistic system representation, dynamic system constraints are considered including ramping rates and minimum up/down times of generating units, load demand profile, and transmission constraints. The IBM ILOG CPLEX optimization studio is utilized to solve the optimization problem. The IEEE 30-bus system is used to validate the proposed strategy under various impact scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing the resilience level of power grids during wildfires.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2022.3145765","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NSF1847578); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9693217","Extreme weather events;generation redispatch;Markov decision process (MDP);resilience;wildfires","Resilience;Costs;Generators;Markov processes;Power systems;Probabilistic logic;Meteorology","failure analysis;integer programming;linear programming;Markov processes;power generation dispatch;power generation reliability;power grids;power system security;probability","enhancing power system operational resilience;wildfires;power grids;power grid resilience;severe weather events;resilience enhancement methods;corrective strategies;restorative strategies;forecasted potential failures;system components;sequential failures;cascading failures;blackouts;extreme weather events;probabilistic proactive generation;Markov decision process;system state transitions;possible system state given component failure probabilities;wildfire spatiotemporal properties;realistic system representation;dynamic system constraints;IEEE 30-bus system;resilience level","","4","","45","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The consensus mechanism is required in almost every blockchain application. Most contemporary blockchain consensus systems need massive processing capabilities, signif-icant energy consumption, and reliance on monetary stake. Because of these limitations, mainstream consensus approaches are unsuitable for low-resource applications such as IoT. As a result, this paper introduces a new consensus protocol known as “Delegated Proof of Accessibility” (DPoAC). The DPoAC protocol minimized the computational resource needs and energy usage demands of the existing proof-based consensus mechanisms, making it appropriate to use in applications with limited resources, such the Internet of Things. In addition, the lack of a financial stake in DPoAC makes it ideal for blockchain-IoT convergence.","","978-1-6654-7524-2","10.1109/ESCI56872.2023.10100031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10100031","Consensus Protocols;DPoAC;IoT;Blockchain;IPFS;Shamir secret sharing","Energy consumption;Data privacy;Distributed ledger;Multi-party computation;Consensus protocol;Reliability;Internet of Things","blockchains;computer network security;cryptocurrencies;distributed processing;energy consumption;Internet of Things;protocols;smart cities","blockchain application;blockchain-IoT convergence;consensus mechanism;consensus protocol;contemporary blockchain consensus systems;distributed ledger technology;DPoAC protocol;energy usage demands;existing proof-based consensus mechanisms;low-resource applications;mainstream consensus approaches;massive processing capabilities;network participants;partici-pants;signif-icant energy consumption;state change","","","","14","IEEE","19 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The limited power point tracking refers to controlling the power output of a photovoltaic array at a level below the maximum power point. The limited power point tracking exhibits advantages over maximum power point tracking (MPPT) both in terms of economy and system security. The previously reported LPPT methods, however, exhibit more oscillations at low power levels or require additional mode changing action under power scarcity and may malfunction under the rapidly varying environmental conditions. To avoid those difficulties, two novel LPPT control schemes are proposed. Both the schemes are carefully designed with minimum deviation from the traditional MPPT control so as to ensure easy implementation. Each of the controllers proposed has its own merit. The LPPT control under the proposed schemes can be implemented without the support of any local energy storage. Detailed case studies are performed to verify the effectiveness of proposed LPPT controllers.","","978-1-5090-3892-3","10.1109/CICPS.2015.7974075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7974075","Incremental conductance method;limited power point tracking;maximum power point tracking;perturb and observe method;photovoltaic system","Photovoltaic systems;Voltage control;Maximum power point trackers;Generators;Convergence;Oscillators","maximum power point trackers;photovoltaic power systems;power system economics;power system security;voltage control","photovoltaic plant;voltage-controlled DC bus;limited power point tracking;LPPT methods;photovoltaic array;maximum power point tracking;MPPT;power system economy;power system security","","5","","14","IEEE","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A distinction between left pectoral unipolar and bipolar pacemaker electrodes has been made here. Furthermore the different positions of a bipolar electrode were taken into consideration. It was found that depending on the position of the bipolar electrodes in a homogeneous magnetic field, major differences of induced voltage occur. The main task of this project is to ascertain the influence of electric conductivity on interference voltage in bipolar electrodes. The measurement circuit has been placed into an original pacemaker case and therefore allowed the comparison between bipolar and unipolar electrodes by only mode switching. The magnetic field has been generated by a Helmholtz coil. Part of the Helmholtz coil system was a model of a human torso filled with saline solution to simulate human tissue. The result of the measurements showed a dependency between electric conductivity and induced voltage. The extensively discussed security factor of bipolar electrodes could be calculated from the above-mentioned measurements.

By collecting the status of each switch through the Southbound, SDN provides a global view for the controller to attain flexible packet forwarding by a proactive mode or a reactive mode. However, a proactive mode is not suitable for highly dynamic networks and reactive mode needs to take a while termed as control delay from the collection state to the start of schedule. In large-scale and dynamic networks, control delay can cause network congestion when the network state changes more severely with high loads. In this paper, an M/D/1 queuing model is proposed to analyze the influence of this control delay, and then deep learning methods combining the advantages of proactive mode and reactive mode are adopted to predict the traffic to manage the traffic routing in advance. To reduce the prediction inaccuracy caused by the randomness and suddenness of traffic, we modify the loss function in deep learning models considering the time correlation and spatial correlation of traffic sequences and this proposed method has the potential to effectively reduce the predicted root mean square error (RMSE) by over 30%. Next, according to the predicted results, we propose a method of adjusting routing paths in advance in SDN to balance the load of overlapping links. Finally, simulation results show that using a deep learning method with a modified loss function can effectively reduce the average end-to-end delay by over 10% under a high load.","2769-3899","979-8-3503-1125-9","10.1109/ICPS58381.2023.10128099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128099","Software-Defined Networking (SDN);deep learning;traffic prediction","Deep learning;Analytical models;Correlation;Switches;Predictive models;Control systems;Routing","computer network security;deep learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;queueing theory;software defined networking;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","average end-to-end delay;collection state;control delay;data planes;deep learning method;deep learning models;flexible packet forwarding;highly dynamic networks;modified loss function;network congestion;network control;network state changes;optimize routing paths;predicted root mean square error;prediction inaccuracy;proactive mode;reactive mode;SDN;Software-Defined Networking;traffic prediction;traffic routing;traffic sequences","","","","22","IEEE","24 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To maintain the availability of the control system, the availability of anomaly detection itself is important. This paper considers a third-party monitoring system with multiple anomaly detection functions. The third monitoring system devotes control systems to control operations instated of security operations. Also, when a control system is subjected to a high-level cyberattack which loses control and security functions, it is expected that the multiple detection functions allow the operator to detect the abnormality earlier. Our proposed system uses two redundant PLCs for sequence control, and one of them is for normal operation, and the other one is for anomaly detection. They operate in conjunction, and when the cyberattacked PLC deviates from the normal operation, the anomaly detection PLC turns on the LED to make it easier to recognize visually, and determines that it is an anomaly. The cyberattack detection method is that the anomaly detection PLC always holds the normal state transition information of the control PLC, and the former PLC always monitors that of the latter PLC. Only when an abnormality occurs, the former PLC detects it as an abnormality. The display method of the detection way is shown by using three types of LEDs. By LEDs turning on or off, the operator can recognize which status is abnormal. The LED lighting state is shown in the state transition diagram, and we explain the superiority of the third-party monitoring system incorporating multiple detection methods.","2474-2325","978-1-7281-6667-4","10.1109/SII46433.2020.9026265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9026265","","Anomaly detection;Control systems;Clocks;Monitoring;Manipulators;Light emitting diodes","control engineering computing;industrial control;Internet;programmable controllers;security of data","security functions;multiple detection functions;sequence control;normal operation;anomaly detection PLC;cyberattack detection method;secured control;industrial control systems;industrial controllers;programmable logic controllers;control system;multiple anomaly detection functions;security operations;third-party monitoring system","","3","","10","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Users can employ the same interface to invoke various applications from the Internet. For security purposes, service providers would control the access to the provided interface through policy enforcement. Yet the access control of REST interfaces lacks a uniform standard regarding the policy language and corresponding enforcement implementation, which brings two limitations: i) Users have to deal with totally different types of policies to accommodate certain systems. ii) Service providers have to design their own platform-specific authorization policy language and the related enforcement mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a REST Policy Language (RestPL) to express the authorization policies especially for REST APIs. RestPL is ensured to be request-oriented, based on our definition of the standard request form. This indicates that a RestPL policy can be automatically generated from an actual request, which helps mitigate a user's pressure during policy designing. Furthermore, we also provide a reference implementation for the enforcement code of RestPL based on regular expressions and deploy it on OpenStack Liberty to demonstrate its feasibility. The experimental results indicate the enforcement overhead of RestPL can be reduced to 80.6% compared with the original policy. In addition, we show that an end-user can also benefit from RestPL for reducing the learning effort by at least 41.6%.","","978-1-5090-2675-3","10.1109/ICWS.2016.92","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7558065","representational state transfer;access control;security policy;request-oriented","Cloud computing;Standards;Authorization;Grammar","application program interfaces;authorisation;formal languages;Web services","RestPL;request-oriented policy language;RESTful API;Web applications;cloud computing systems;representational state transfer;Internet;security purposes;service providers;access control;policy enforcement;REST interfaces;authorization policy language;REST policy language;regular expressions;OpenStack Liberty","","5","","18","IEEE","1 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These protocols are expected to guarantee security, speed, low latency, less power consumption, reliability and efficient transfer of information between the devices. There are several application layer protocols available like Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket, Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Representational State Transfer (RESTFUL Services) and Data Distribution Services (DDS) that are employed in practice. The suitable protocol is selected based on the nature and requirements of the IoT system. However there are no standard guidelines in deciding a particular protocol for the IoT application. There is always uncertainty in deciding the application protocol suitable for the IoT requirements. Thereby, it is inevitable to know the strengths and weakness of the widely accepted protocols to determine the best-fit scenarios. Amongst these CoAP and MQTT are the most diffused protocols in the IoT landscape. This paper surveys five established protocols – CoAP, MQTT, Websocket, XMPP and AMQP. It discusses the origin of these protocols, the general characteristics, advantages and limitations. Furthermore, the paper does an in-depth comparative analysis of the protocols against the suitability of application areas. Additionally, the paper also explains the standard implementation architecture of the protocols.

The design leads to not necessarily $T$-functions as state transition functions of the automata involved in the ciphering and deciphering sides.

Hardware design obfuscation is a promising countermeasure to resist reverse engineering attacks and IP piracy. The majority of existing hardware obfuscation methods modify the original finite state machine (FSM) by adding additional state transitions and utilizing a key sequence to lock the transition from the nonfunctional states to the functional reset state. Those methods are effective to prevent attackers from entering the normal functional mode but they lack resilience if the FSM is already in the normal mode. This paper proposes to protect all the states with a low-cost state-deflection-based obfuscation method, which dynamically deflects state transitions from the original transition path to a black hole cluster if a wrong key is applied. Unlike other works that use static transitions between legal states to black hole states at the design time, this method utilizes a state rotation function (Rotatefunc) and selective register flipping function (Mapfunc) to dynamically control the state deflection paths. Hence, the difficulty of reverse engineering and thwarting register overwrite attacks is increased. Simulations performed on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits show that the proposed method significantly reduces the difference of the net toggle activities between the correct and wrong key scenarios, and achieves up to 56% higher code coverage than the most efficient obfuscation method. Thanks to the dynamic deflection feature, on average, this method generates about 100 more unique state register patterns than other methods with moderate power increase. Moreover, the proposed method achieves the Hamming distance of primary outputs and state registers close to 50%.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2017.2697960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7911190","Design obfuscation;gate-level netlist;hardware security;intellectual property (IP) piracy;reverse engineering;state deflection","Registers;Hardware;IP networks;Security;Hamming distance;Logic gates;Reverse engineering","finite state machines;flip-flops;integrated circuit design;invasive software","novel dynamic state-deflection method;gate-level design;emerging security threats;integrated circuit supply chain;chip integrity;hardware intellectual property piracy;hardware design obfuscation;reverse engineering attacks;hardware obfuscation methods;original finite state machine;FSM;key sequence;nonfunctional states;functional reset state;normal functional mode;low-cost state-deflection;original transition path;black hole cluster;static transitions;legal states;black hole states;design time;state deflection paths;dynamic deflection feature;primary outputs;state transitions;benchmark circuits;selective register flipping function;unique state register patterns;register overwrite attacks;state rotation function","","45","","29","IEEE","25 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, in the normal state of the system, it is important to study the state transition and its harm to the system through security analysis. Besides, adopting certain control measures to reduce the risk of the system, such as the coordination of prevention and emergency control, is of great significance to both the safety and the economy of the system. In this premise, this paper proposes a risk-based two-layer optimization model for coordination on prevention control and emergency control of quasi-steady state AC-DC system. By introducing a continuous derivable function, the non-derivable constraints in the traditional model are replaced by continuous derivable constraints. The method can greatly improve the computational efficiency of the model. According to the characteristic of the two-layer optimization model, the first layer optimization problem is solved by the golden section method, and the second layer optimization problem is solved by the active and reactive power alternating approach method.

These systems are commonly used for the security purposes but are increasingly being used in a variety of other applications such as residential security, voter verification, banking using ATM. Changes in facial expression become a difficult task in recognizing faces. In this paper continuous naturalistic affective expressions will be recognized using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework. Active Appearance Model (AAM) landmarks are considered for each frame of the videos. The AAMs were used to track the face and extract its visual features. There are six different facial expressions considered over here: Happy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Fear and Sad. Different Expression recognition problem is solved through a multistage automatic pattern recognition system where the temporal relationships are modeled through the HMM framework. Dimension levels (i.e., labels) can be defined as the hidden states sequences in the HMM framework. Then the probabilities of these hidden states and their state transitions can be accurately computed from the labels of the training set. Through a three stage classification approach, the output of a first-stage classification is used as observation sequences for a second stage classification, modeled as a HMM-based framework. The k-NN will be used for the first stage classification. A third classification stage, a decision fusion tool, is then used to boost overall performance.","","978-1-4799-2320-5","10.1109/ECS.2014.6892800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892800","Hidden Markov model (HMM);K Nearest Neighbor (k-NN);Active Appearance Model (AAM);Dimension levels","Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling;Face recognition;Speech recognition;Active appearance model;Support vector machine classification;Speech","biometrics (access control);face recognition;hidden Markov models","hidden states;state transitions;AAM landmarks;active appearance model;HMM framework;ATM;banking;voter verification;residential security;digital image;biometric software application;Hidden Markov Model;automatic human facial expression recognition","","5","","23","IEEE","8 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By introducing the maximum entropy (MaxENT) models into the rule optimization for the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model, this paper proposes an improved BLP model with the self-learning function: MaxENT-BLP. This model first formalizes the security properties, system states, transformational rules, and a constraint model based on the states transition of the MaxENT. After handling the historical system access logs as the original data sets, this model extracts the user requests, current states, and decisions to act as the feature vectors. Second, we use k -fold cross validation to divide all vectors into a training set and a testing set. In this paper, the model training process is based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. And this model contains a strategy update algorithm to adjust the access control rules dynamically according to the access and decision records in a system. Third, we prove that MaxENT-BLP is secure through theoretical analysis. By estimating the precision, recall, and F1-score, the experiments show the availability and accuracy of this model. Finally, this paper provides the process of model training based on deep learning and discussions regarding adversarial samples from the malware classifiers. We demonstrate that MaxENT-BLP is an appropriate choice and has the ability to help running information systems to avoid more risks and losses.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2018.2807793","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572176,L1624040); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0202201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8295130","Adversarial sample;BLP;machine learning;mandatory access control;maximum entropy model;rule optimization","Hidden Markov models;Training;Access control;Data models;Feature extraction;Machine learning","authorisation;entropy;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation","historical access;security policies;regulations;running system process;system security status;maximum entropy models;rule optimization;improved BLP model;MaxENT-BLP;security properties;system states;transformational rules;constraint model;states transition;historical system access;training set;Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm;access control rules;decision records;running information systems;training process;self-adaptive Bell-LaPadula model;access control models;precision;recall;F1-score","","16","","37","IEEE","19 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, Ajax techniques that enable better web experiences also make it fairly challenging to model Ajax application behaviors in the complex browser environment. In Ajax applications, server-side states are no longer synchronous with the views to end users at the client side. Therefore, to model the behaviors of Ajax applications, it is indispensable to incorporate client-side application states into the behavior models, as being explored by prior work. Unfortunately, how to leverage behavior models to perform security diagnosis in Ajax applications has yet been thoroughly examined. Existing models extracted from Ajax application behaviors are insufficient in a security context. In this paper, we propose a new behavior model for diagnosing attacks in Ajax applications, which abstracts both client-side state transitions as well as their communications to external servers. Our model articulates different states with the browser events or user actions that trigger state transitions. With a prototype implementation, we demonstrate that the proposed model is effective in attack diagnosis for real-world Ajax applications.","","978-0-7695-5007-7","10.1109/ICECCS.2013.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6601822","","Electronic mail;Browsers;Security;Context;Web servers;Load modeling","Internet;online front-ends;security of data","comprehensive client-side behavior model;real-world Ajax applications;complex Web-based systems;complex browser environment;security incident diagnosis;external servers;browser events;user actions;state transitions;prototype implementation;attack diagnosis","","9","","41","IEEE","19 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electric power dispatch systems, management information systems, customer relation systems and so on, are all built on this infrastructure. It is an important task for network administrators of electric power industry to monitor, control and manage electric power information networks. Through installing safeguards, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems and anti-virus systems, the reliability of Electric Power Information Networks has been improved to a certain extent. However, threats also exist due to the loss of comprehensive understanding about network vulnerability. System methods should be employed to the vulnerability research of electric power information networks. Modeling Electric Power Information Network vulnerability and finding network flaws become more and more critical. A network intruder will take a series of actions to achieve a certain goal, and each action will change the state of a network. Thereby attack trees can be used to model the vulnerability of a network. An attack tree can be viewed as a directed tree where vertices represent network states and edges represent actions that lead state transitions. Root vertex is a certain goal. Any path from a leaf vertex to the root vertex is a whole attack pattern violating the security property of a network. A node of an attack tree can be decomposed as a set of attack sub-goals, either all of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed, or any one of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed. So there are two decomposition operations in an attack tree: AND and OR. Formal logic can be applied to attack analysis. Thus we can model attacks for network vulnerability analysis. This modeling method has two major advantages. At first it can be used to analyze the flaws of a network and find unknown flaws. Secondly network administrators use it to handle flaws rationally under the limits of the finite resources. Electric power information networks are generally made up of production control networks, enterprise management networks and external networks. They are connected and form a complex network. It is necessary to comprehend and analyze its vulnerability. An information network of an electric power plant is illustrated, and attack modeling is used to analyze its vulnerability. Industry control computers can manipulate electric devices. It is vital to guarantee industry control computers. Hence the goal is set to obtain the administrator right of an industry control computer. An attack tree is constructed tolocate the flaws of the network. Some advices to network security administrators are given. It is an attempt to formulate the security administration of electric power information networks using attack trees. Faulty Tree Method (FTM) has been used to analysis the reliability of power systems. Attack tree can help integrate the reliability analysis of the hybrid system consisting of an electric power system and an electric power information network system.","","978-1-4244-5940-7","10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5666152","Electric power information network;attack tree;vulnerability;network security","Servers;Computational modeling;Monitoring;Analytical models;Security;Fires","directed graphs;fault trees;formal logic;load dispatching;power system reliability;power system simulation;security of data;trees (mathematics)","electric power information networks;attack modeling;electric power system;electric power dispatch system;management information system;customer relation system;safeguard;directed tree;root vertex;formal logic;network vulnerability analysis;enterprise management networks;production control networks;industry control computer;network security administrators;faulty tree method;FTM;power system reliability;power system analysis","","","","15","IEEE","13 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, decentralized services offer unique challenges for evolution and adaptation that reach well beyond any one single organizational boundary. However, client-driven service customization and tailoring is a powerful tool for meeting conflicting, independent client demands in an environment where disorderly and uneven service evolution predominates. To this end, we contribute an architectural style, COmputAtional State Transfer (COAST), designed to provide extensive, safe, and secure client-directed customization of decentralized services.

Instead of coding the absolute gain level, only the difference between the input gain and the average gain for the quantisation template is transmitted. For the pitch quantizer, the direction of pitch change is coded rather than the actual pitch value. All the quantisation levels are gray coded which improves robustness. The performances in term of objective measures which show the merits of employing Gray-coding into the quantized speech parameters are given.

Petri net as an important formal tool for modeling, analysis and analysis of distributed, parallel and real-time systems provides a solid foundation for CPS modeling. However, Petri nets lack the ability to describe spatial information, so it is impossible to fully model CPS. Incorrect system modeling can directly affect system reliability and even life-threatening and property safety, Therefore, when modeling and analyzing CPS characteristics, a more complete modeling method is needed. This paper extends the Defect extension time Petri net and constructs a spatiotemporal Petri net that can describe the positional changes of CPS physical entities. This paper also analyzes the physical characteristics of CPS in detail, starting from the classification and characteristics of physical entities, and deeply studying the properties of CPS physical entities and their location transition process. Proposing a formal modeling method for CPS physical entities; Introducing spatial factors on the basis of Petri nets by analyzing the characteristics that Petri nets must satisfy, getting the formal definition of Petri net, It can not only describe the physical entity logic and time-level behavior, but also describe the state changes caused by physical entity location changes.Firstly, using petri net to finely model important equipment in information systems, and then based on these models and the attack source delivery path, establishing the fine Bayesian cyber attack model. With the combination of the observed real-time attack events, we dynamically update the probability of attack behavior based on Bayesian reasoning.

Communications via RF signals are generally reliable and well understood but cannot support emerging data rate needs unless they use a large portion of the precious radio spectrum. FSO communications offer enormous data rates but operate much more at the mercy of the environment. The perennial limitations of FSO communications are manifested in the channel attributes of scintillation (optical turbulence) and path obscurations. Both phenomena reduce the availability of the optical channel to support reliable communications. To design transmission techniques that operate optimally in channel obscurants, a good understanding of the channel behavior is necessary. In most prior works, Monte-Carlo ray tracing (MCRT) algorithm has been used to estimate channel parameters. This task is quite numerically intensive. The focus of this paper is on investigating the possibility of simplifying this task by a direct introduction of state transition matrices associated with standard Markov modeling into the MCRT computer simulations programs. We show that by tracing a photonpsilas trajectory in space via a Markov chain model, the angular distribution can be calculated via simple matrix multiplications. We also demonstrate that the new approach produces results that are close to those obtained by MCRT and other known methods. The value of the proposed method lies in its simplicity and numeric efficiency compared to the computationally intensive MCRT.","2155-7586","978-1-4244-2676-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753359","Angular dispersion;channel modeling;Markov chain;Monte-Carlo ray tracing;scattering","Atmospheric modeling;Laser modes;Optical scattering;Communication system security;Ray tracing;Space technology;Bit rate;Radio frequency;Optical sensors;Military computing","broadband networks;laser beam applications;Markov processes;military communication;Monte Carlo methods;optical communication;telecommunication network reliability","Markov chain;atmospheric channel modeling;free space laser communications;free space optical communications;broadband applications;FSO communications;scintillation;optical turbulence;path obscurations;reliable communications;state transition matrices;Monte-Carlo ray tracing algorithm;military operations","","4","","13","IEEE","19 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are certain attacks like ARP spoofing, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) error message based attacks etc. for which passive monitoring schemes have several limitations because in such attacks there is no change in sequence of events.

Its novel callback mechanism and virtual network device connection capability cost-effectively enhance user controlled testing intelligence for verifying protocols with complicated state transitions.

Specifically, false data injection attacks aim at tampering with the sensed data that reflect the normal system operation state. Therefore, a time-efficient and accurate approach to assessing sensor trustworthiness is necessary. To this end, we propose T-LHDM (a trust model based on low and high decision-making processes), a sensor state trust model based on a Markov chain to represent sensor state transitions in normal operating conditions. To demonstrate the model, we first observed sensed data in a hierarchical decision-making process by intentionally exploiting the sensor data’s temporal and spatial correlations. Then, the consistency between the precomputed set of sensor state transitions and the observed ones was used to detect corruptions and assess the sensor trustworthiness. Our experiments using two real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed model accurately assessed the sensor trustworthiness with an average accuracy of 95%. We also stress the significance of considering the sensor’s spatiotemporal correlations to assess the trust of the sensed data, which has been neglected in previous studies. To this end, we conducted a comparative evaluation against a contemporary temporal correlation-based method and three well-known correlation tests. The results showed that T-LHDM outperformed all the competing methods.","2641-810X","978-1-6654-7402-3","10.1109/EDCC57035.2022.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9933141","Sensor correlations;False data attack;IoT","Correlation;Systems operation;Decision making;Markov processes;Data models;Spatial databases;Spatiotemporal phenomena","computer crime;decision making;Internet of Things;Markov processes;security of data;telecommunication security","sensed data;contemporary temporal correlation-based method;trust assessment model;hierarchical decision-making process;IoT sensor networks;IoT devices;false data injection attacks;normal system operation state;low decision-making processes;high decision-making processes;sensor state trust model;sensor state transitions;sensor data;T-LHDM;Markov chain;real-world datasets","","","","27","IEEE","2 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, when the inter-domain routing system faces security incidents such as disasters and attacks, it is easy to cause the continuous propagation of link failures, resulting in a large-scale network disconnection and posing a considerable threat to the security of the Internet. The previous research mainly aims to enhance the protocol's safety, cannot change the original failure propagation mechanism, and cannot fundamentally solve cascading failure propagation. In response to this problem, this paper introduces SDN and proposes RSM-PA. This method perceives the available path topology by sharing the link state information in the region, provides a verification mechanism for the availability of the route in the routing process to avoid the link failure in the region due to overload. The comparison of routing results before and after the link state changes under the same experimental conditions shows that RSM-PA can effectively adjust the routing strategy according to the path availability, and lay a solid foundation for suppressing the propagation of cascading failures.","","978-1-6654-9457-1","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00075","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61502528,61402525); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781081","Inter-domain Routing System;Software-defined Networking;Route Selection","Network topology;Heuristic algorithms;Power system protection;Routing;Real-time systems;Routing protocols;Internet","computer network security;routing protocols;software defined networking;telecommunication network topology","route selection method;inter-domain routing system;path availability;routing selection process;link failure;original failure propagation mechanism;link state information;routing process;link state;routing strategy;RSM-PA","","","","22","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different from previous approaches, the proposed method accurately evaluates the annual cost and benefits obtainable by FACTS devices installation by formulating a large-scale optimization problem that contains power flow analyses for a large number of system states representing annual power system operations. In addition, dynamic state transitions caused by specified contingencies are also simulated in the optimization problem to evaluate the effect of FACTS control actions as well as the other coordinated controls. The expected cost consists of operating cost under normal and contingency states along with their related probabilities to occur. Maximizing social welfare is the objective for normal state while minimizing compensations for generations re-scheduling and load shedding as well as maximizing social welfare are the objectives in case of contingency.

To use SCR effectively for critical applications, automated verification of safety properties is important. The fact that model checking approaches are sometimes problematic motivates us to further examine the alternative approach of theorem proving. Theorem proving, in general, is a difficult task; however the regular structure of the proof obligations generated from SCR specifications suggests that relatively unsophisticated theorem provers can discharge many of these obligations. As a feasibility study, we use the B-Toolkit to detect safety violations in an example SCR specification. The B-Toolkit is a good choice because it is commercially available and Supports verified refinement to executables in a commercial programming language (C). We convert the mode transition table in the example SCR specification to an AMN (Abstract Machine Notation) specification and analyze the result with the B-Toolkit. The B-Toolkit generates 120 proof obligations of which 113 are automatically discharged by the theorem prover. The remaining 7 proof obligations are, in fact, not theorems and correspond to the 3 problems in the SCR specification detected by the model checking approaches. For the corrected SCR specification, the B-Toolkit automatically discharges all proof obligations. The example shows that even simple theorem provers are a viable approach to automated analysis for SCR specifications.","","0-7803-3979-7","10.1109/CMPASS.1997.613186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=613186","","Safety;Thyristors;Application software;Software systems;Costs;Logic;Systems engineering and theory;Computer languages;Software tools;Security","formal specification;software tools;theorem proving","B-toolkit;SCR specifications;event-driven systems;Software Cost Reduction;specifications;theorem proving;safety violations;Abstract Machine Notation","","","","27","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, how to divide the administrative privileges remains a difficulty in practice. In this work, we simplify the privilege partitioning problem into a classification problem of RESTful functions, so the permission to call a category of functions can be granted to a specific administrator. We propose a RESTful API classification approach called RestSep based on genetic algorithm. A classification is represented as a 2-dimensional matrix, which is used as the chromosome. Customized operators of selection, mutation and crossover are designed. The fitness function is designed to balance parameters such as number of categories, test case coverage, function overlapping, etc. Experiments on popular clouds like OpenStack and Kubernetes indicate RestSep can generate a self-explanatory classification result, which can serve as a guideline for privilege partitioning. The overhead of test generation is at most 13.1% and the overhead of genetic algorithm is at most 183.29s, which are acceptable for practical use.","","978-1-5386-0752-7","10.1109/ICWS.2017.64","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029806","representational state transfer;privilege partition;genetic algorithm;integration test","Cloud computing;Genetic algorithms;Sociology;Statistics;Access control","application program interfaces;authorisation;cloud computing;genetic algorithms;matrix algebra;pattern classification","RestSep;test-oriented privilege partitioning approach;web applications;representational state transfer API;security purposes;service providers;administrative privileges;classification problem;RESTful functions;RESTful API classification approach;genetic algorithm;2-dimensional matrix;fitness function;test case coverage;function overlapping;self-explanatory classification result;test generation;cloud computing systems;mutation operator;crossover operator;access control;selection operator","","2","","23","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to low-resource and poor computing capability, these devices have a high number of firmware vulnerabilities. Software verification is a powerful solution to ensure the correctness and security of IoT firmware programs. Unfortunately, due to the complex semantics and syntax of program languages (typically C), applying software verification in IoT firmware faces the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. One of the fundamental reasons is that verification methods cannot support verifying state transitions on the memory space caused by pointer operations well. To this end, by combining sparse value flow (SVF) analysis into model checking and optimizing computational redundancy among them, we design a novel points-to-sensitive model checker, called PCHECKER, which can provide a highly precise and efficient verification for IoT firmware programs. We first design a spatial flow model to effectively describe state behaviors of a C program both on the symbolic and memory space. We then propose a counterexample-guided model checking algorithm that can dynamically refine abstract precisions and update nondeterministic points-to relations. With a set of C benchmarks containing a variety of pointer operations and other complex C features, our experiments have shown that compared with state of the art (SOTA), PCHECKER can achieve outstanding results in the verification tasks of C programs that its verification accuracy is 95.9%, and its average verification time of each line of code is 1.27 ms, which are both better than existing model checkers.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3163383","Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2022JQ-611); Basic Research Programs of Taicang(grant numbers:TC2020JC03); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515110279); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:D5000210588); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745051","Model checking;pointer analysis;spare value flow analysis;software verification","Model checking;Computational modeling;Software;Internet of Things;Analytical models;Semantics;Security","C language;firmware;Internet of Things;program verification;storage management","C program;firmware vulnerabilities;software verification;IoT firmware programs;complex semantics;program languages;pointer operations;sparse value flow analysis;spatial flow model;nondeterministic points-to relations;state transition verification;points-to-sensitive model checker;counterexample-guided model checking;Internet of Things;memory space;SVF;computational redundancy;PCHECKER","","","","45","IEEE","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Delay-on-Miss technique is one such approach, which simply delays loads that miss in the L1 cache until they become non-speculative, resulting in no transient changes in the memory hierarchy. However, this costs performance, prompting the use of value prediction (VP) to regain some of the delay.However, the problem cannot be solved by simply introducing a new kind of speculation (value prediction). Value-predicted loads have to be validated, which cannot be commenced until the load becomes non-speculative. Thus, value-predicted loads occupy the same amount of precious core resources (e.g., reorder buffer entries) as Delay-on-Miss. The end result is that VP only yields marginal benefits over Delay-on-Miss.In this paper, our insight is that we can achieve the same goal as VP (increasing performance by providing the value of loads that miss) without incurring its negative side-effect (delaying the release of precious resources), if we can safely, non-speculatively, recompute a value in isolation (without being seen from the outside), so that we do not expose any information by transferring such a value via the memory hierarchy. Value Recomputation, which trades computation for data transfer was previously proposed in an entirely different context: to reduce energy-expensive data transfers in the memory hierarchy. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of value recomputation in relation to the Delay-on-Miss approach of hiding speculation, discuss the trade-offs, and show that we can achieve the same level of security, reaching 93% of the unsecured baseline performance (5% higher than Delay-on-miss), and exceeding (by 3%) what even an oracular (100% accuracy and coverage) value predictor could do.","","978-1-6654-2025-9","10.1109/SEED51797.2021.00021","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604354","security;microarchitecture;recomputation;speculation","Microarchitecture;Costs;Side-channel attacks;Data transfer;Software;Delays;Security","cache storage;computer architecture;cryptography","value recomputation;speculative side-channel attacks;microarchitectural state changes;Delay-on-Miss technique;memory hierarchy;value prediction;VP;value-predicted loads;invisible speculation performance;L1 cache","","","","51","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in such inherent low-inertia systems, randomness and fluctuation of the output power of RESs and uncertain load consumption can easily incur dynamic stability issues, such as transient power impact, unacceptable frequency deviations, and operation mode transitions for security. To solve the above problems and enhance the dynamic stability of the system, an enhanced dynamic stability control (EDSC) scheme with locally measured signals only is proposed in this paper. In this control scheme, the bi-directional interlinking dc-ac converter uses the ac frequency in ac MG as the reference value of dc voltage and adopts the current feedforward control to control the dc voltage in the dc MG to be consistent with the ac frequency. By electrically coupling dc voltage and ac frequency, power disturbances in ac or dc sides will cause almost identical variation degrees in both ac frequency and dc voltage. Under the proposed EDSC scheme, the distributed ESSs in both ac and dc sides are then automatically coordinated and controlled by the unified droop control to balance transient power disturbances and smooth output of diesel generator under normal condition, which can effectively improve stability and controllability of such low-inertia systems. Furthermore, in an emergency such as failure of diesel generator, the operation mode can be switched seamlessly with the proposed EDSC scheme. The detailed theoretical analysis including control system design, small signal model analysis of key parameter influence on system dynamics, and simulation verifications in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment is presented to verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed EDSC scheme.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926814","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51807135); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8755829","Low-inertia hybrid ac/dc microgrids;distributed energy storage systems;enhanced dynamic stability control;transient power sharing;seamless transition","Generators;Power system stability;Frequency control;Voltage control;Transient analysis;Hybrid power systems;Stability analysis","control system synthesis;controllability;DC-AC power convertors;distributed power generation;electric current control;energy storage;feedforward;hybrid power systems;power generation control;power generation reliability;power system CAD;power system stability;renewable energy sources;voltage control","distributed energy storage systems;isolated remote areas;islands;power supply reliability;enhanced dynamic stability control scheme;bi-directional interlinking dc-ac converter;ac frequency;current feedforward control;EDSC scheme;distributed ESSs;unified droop control;transient power disturbances;controllability;system dynamics;diesel generators;dc voltage control;control system design;low-inertia hybrid ac-dc microgrid;renewable energy sources-based distributed generators;RES;uncertain load consumption;ac-dc MG;small signal model analysis;PSCAD-EMTDC environment","","43","","24","CCBY","5 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since they contain sensitive information, whole collected data should be stored in a platform that guarantee both data confidentiality and integrity. In this sense, permissioned blockchain i.e. Hyperledger can be seen as an auspicious candidate for providing a secure yet scalable storage platform thanks to its data integrity and peers decentralization features. Considering that both IoT and blockchain network have different working mechanism, therefore, a software platform is required to provide an integration layer between the IoT and blockchain network. In this paper, we propose the design of IoT-to-Blockchain platform for integrating internet of things based smart healthcare system and blockchain network. The proposed system consists of five components including blcokchain-to-device interface, chain code execution interface, membership service provider (MSP), peers node and ordering node. The proposed system consists of five components including HTTP-based API gateway as device-to-blockchain interface, membership service provider (MSP), peers node and orderer. At first, the API gateway receives sensing data from IoT gateway device. Upon reception, the API gateway acting as client invokes chain code installed in each blockchain peer by emitting a transaction proposal to peers. Peers then simulate the execution and send back the endorsed data to the client i.e. API gateway. Collected endorsement from various peers are sent to orderer which then build a block containing an ordered transactions received from all clients and then broadcast that block to all peers. Each peer the performs a final verification before committing all ordered transactions on that block into its own local ledger. By using this mechanism, every peer in network can receive similar transaction orders which lead to identical ledger state changes.","","978-1-7281-5163-2","10.1109/NICS48868.2019.9023797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9023797","","Logic gates;Peer-to-peer computing;Sensors;Internet of Things;Medical services;Cloud computing","application program interfaces;body area networks;computer network security;cryptography;data integrity;distributed databases;health care;Internet of Things;internetworking;medical information systems;transaction processing","blockchain peer;endorsed data;API gateway;ordered transactions;smart healthcare system;blockchain network;personal health data;wireless body area network;data confidentiality;permissioned blockchain;storage platform;data integrity;software platform;integration layer;blcokchain-to-device interface;chain code execution interface;membership service provider;peers node;ordering node;device-to-blockchain interface;sensing data;IoT gateway device;IoT-to-blockchain platform;Internet of Things;HTTP-based API gateway","","14","","8","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper is a case study of 3 installed DTT systems that use cellular communication - one system at Central Virginia Electric Cooperative and two at Dominion Energy. In this paper the authors will report on the design, implementation, performance and issues encountered during and post project execution. These intelligent DTT systems have been designed to increase availability of the DG by preventing the indiscriminate disconnection of the sites. Traditionally Direct Transfer Trip Signals (DTT) has been sent between substations and remote Distributed Generation (DG) sites using leased telephone lines. If DTT communication is interrupted, the DTT system will disconnect the DG site. Leased copper lines are becoming less reliable, leading to unwanted disconnection of DG sites. Installation of fiber is not always feasible due to the cost. This paper will discuss an approach to provide DTT signals using wireless communications. The paper will address the security concerns that many Utilities might face. Two new innovations to increase the DG site's availability will be discussed. 1) Automatic Direct Transfer Close If system conditions return to normal after a DTT event, the system will automatically close the DG site back in onto the feeder. 2) Dynamic Feeder State change protection function. Using cellular or wireless communication systems it must be expected that there will be communication interruptions during normal maintenance actions. During these times the DG site device activates a new protection function that will detect any anomalies that could constitute a change in the connected feeder systems (e.g. caused by a fault or the opening of a breaker) and then only disconnect the DG site.","2474-9753","978-1-7281-4019-3","10.1109/CPRE.2019.8765861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765861","","Substations;Reliability;Optical fiber communication;Optical fiber devices;Telephone sets;Wireless communication;Circuit faults","cellular radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","dynamic feeder state change protection function;automatic direct transfer;distributed generation;substations;intelligent direct transfer trip signal;Dominion Energy;intelligent DTT signal system;remote distributed generation sites;copper lines;telephone lines;communication reliability problems;connected feeder systems;DG site device;wireless communication systems;cellular communication systems;DTT communication;Central Virginia Electric Cooperative","","2","","2","IEEE","18 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the fast processing speed of symmetric key encryption methods, due to the problem in key exchange, hybrid encryption solves the security problem of key exchange using asymmetric key method. The asymmetric-key method is difficult to provide smooth services due to the decrease in processing speed caused by computational complexity. The hybrid method is designed to take advantage of the fast processing speed of the symmetric-key, and the secure exchange method of the key used in the symmetric-key operates by using the asymmetric-key. However, with the advent of quantum computer technology, encryption techniques using the asymmetric-key method are changing in the same way as increasing the key size used. Therefore, we will explain the AI application method using the state change of Rubik’s cube to generate keys in the latest state in the symmetric-key encryption system. The application of the Rubik’s cube state change algorithm, which operates on the AI base described in this paper, has the advantage of inducing and using the used key without exchanging the pre-shared key. Because of this key induction method, malicious attackers have little information on the keys used for encryption and decryption, so it is judged that the confidentiality and integrity of key generation and management can be secured more safely. We intend to improve the problem of key exchange and management in existing encryption systems by generating and managing keys through the Rubik’s cube state change algorithm, which operates based on AI.","1976-7684","978-1-6654-6268-6","10.1109/ICOIN56518.2023.10048916","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10048916","Artificial intelligence;key generation;symmetric-key encryption method;cryptography;Information security","Web and internet services;Focusing;Receivers;Companies;Speech recognition;Encryption;Internet","artificial intelligence;computational complexity;cryptography","AI application method;asymmetric key method;hybrid symmetric key encryption methods;key exchange;key generation method;key induction method;key management method;pre-shared key;Rubik's cube state change algorithm;secure exchange method","","","","8","IEEE","22 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a consequence, the system maintains an equivalent degree of system availability without requiring more replicas than a traditional replication system. Furthermore, having the old replica available on the same physical host as the rejuvenated replica helps to optimize state transfer. The problem of remote transfer is reduced to remote validation of the state in the frequent case when the local replica has not been corrupted.","1060-9857","0-7695-2995-X","10.1109/SRDS.2007.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365686","","Virtual machine monitors;Application software;Costs;Operating systems;Distributed computing;Large-scale systems;Computer networks;Communication networks;Communication system security;Computer security","distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;security of data","hypervisor-based efficient proactive recovery;intrusion tolerant systems;fault tolerant systems;virtualization-based replication infrastructure","","25","2","24","IEEE","29 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For each sampled scenario, an iterative dynamic scenario updating approach is introduced to consider interactions among covariate conditions, random component outages, and maintenance outage scheduling. The co-optimization problem is decoupled into three separate optimization subproblems by Lagrangian relaxation (LR), which include generation maintenance scheduling, transmission maintenance scheduling, and short-term SCUC problems. Each scenario is dynamically updated based on the optimal maintenance outage and SCUC solutions, and maintenance and SCUC solutions are re-optimized using the updated scenario. The iterative procedure stops when neither the optimal schedule nor the dynamic scenario changes any further. The overall convergence of the proposed Monte Carlo-based framework is checked by the coefficient of variation (CV) of costs over multiple scenarios. Case studies on the 6-bus system and the IEEE 118-bus system are used to exhibit the effectiveness of proposed framework.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2521720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7414527","Covariates;maintenance outage scheduling;Monte Carlo simulation;proportional hazard model;security-constrained unit commitment;severe weather","Maintenance engineering;Optimal scheduling;Power systems;Monte Carlo methods;Meteorology;Dynamic scheduling","approximation theory;hazards;iterative methods;maintenance engineering;Monte Carlo methods;power generation reliability;power generation scheduling;power system security;power transmission reliability;sampling methods;stochastic programming","stochastic cooptimization;midterm-term maintenance outage scheduling;short-term maintenance outage scheduling;power systems;integrated framework;short-term generation maintenance scheduling;short-term transmission maintenance scheduling;midterm maintenance decisions;short-term security-constrained unit commitment;short-term SCUC problems;recursive sampling method;Monte Carlo-based framework;proportional hazard model;PHM;iterative dynamic scenario updating approach;covariate conditions;random component outages;separate optimization subproblems;Lagrangian relaxation;coefficient-of-variation;6-bus system;IEEE 118-bus system;component aging","","47","","25","IEEE","19 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the inherent mechanical energy consumption and the long-range signal propagation pathloss, the traditional cruising and hovering UAV relay modes are deficient in energy utilization and secrecy rate, respectively. Modeling of the secrecy energy efficiency with respect to UAV mode adaptation is limited in the literature and deserves further investigation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secrecy rate-energy efficient UAV relay mode adaptation scheme for secure wireless communications scenarios where the eavesdropping locations are known, i.e., the eavesdropper is a hijacked internal legitimate node. In this secure system, the UAV cooperatively assists the legitimate transmissions and injects artificial interference to the eavesdropper. We investigate optimum UAV placement and relay period planning for the hovering and the cruising relay modes, respectively. By modeling the UAV modes transfer and maximizing the secrecy energy efficiency, the optimum mode adaptation ratios are obtained under both the secrecy rate-prioritized and the energy-saving criteria. In addition, the proposed UAV relay mode adaptation mechanism is further studied for each UAV task division, to adapt to the dynamic channel variations and enhance the security. Our theoretical analysis shows that the mode adaptation ratio is determined by the secrecy rate-energy gain between the cruising and the hovering modes, and by the energy consumption threshold of the UAV relays. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves higher secrecy energy efficiency than the traditional schemes.","2473-2400","","10.1109/TGCN.2023.3243394","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3904404,2020YFB1807003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071250,62222107,62071223,62031012,62271399); Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by China Association for Science and Technology; Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China(grant numbers:20KJB510033); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2242022R40030); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2022KW-07); Erik Jonsson Distinguished Professorship at UT-Dalla; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040747","UAV;secrecy rate;energy efficiency;mode adaptation;relay","Autonomous aerial vehicles;Relays;Three-dimensional displays;Monitoring;Eavesdropping;Security;Wireless communication","artificial intelligence;autonomous aerial vehicles;energy conservation;energy consumption;mobile radio;optimisation;relay networks (telecommunication);telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless channels","artificial interference;artificial noise;cruising UAV relay modes;dynamic channel variations;eavesdroppers;eavesdropping locations;energy consumption threshold;energy utilization;energy-saving criteria;hijacked internal legitimate node;hovering UAV relay modes;inherent mechanical energy consumption;legitimate transmission;legitimate transmissions;long-range signal propagation pathloss;mode adaptation ratio;mode adaptive secure UAV relay transmissions;optimum mode adaptation ratios;optimum UAV placement;relay period;secrecy energy efficiency;secrecy rate improvement;secrecy rate-energy efficient UAV relay mode adaptation scheme;secrecy rate-energy gain;secrecy rate-prioritized criteria;secure system;secure wireless communications scenarios;security enhancement;UAV modes transfer;UAV relay mode adaptation mechanism;UAV task division;unmanned aerial vehicles;wireless transmission security enhancement","","","","27","IEEE","8 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25  000 (25 k) RegExes. Based on the throughput of our LaFA prototype on FPGA, we estimate that a 34-Gb/s throughput can be achieved.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2181411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134694","Deep packet inspection;DPI;LaFA;Lookahead Finite Automata;network intrusion detection and prevention system;NIDPS;regular expressions","Data structures;Doped fiber amplifiers;Complexity theory;Timing;Correlation;Automata;Memory management","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;inspection","scalable lookahead regular expression detection system;deep packet inspection;RegEx detection systems;state transition detection;per-character-state processing;suboptimal character-based detection method;lookahead finite automata;LaFA;single-commodity field programmable gate array;FPGA chip;network intrusion detection;bit rate 34 Gbit/s","","21","","34","IEEE","18 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, integration of intelligence and cyber systems into a power grid can lead to serious cyber security challenges and makes the overall system more vulnerable to cyber attacks. To address this challenging issue, this article presents defense mechanisms to either protect the system from attackers in advance or detect the existence of data injection attacks to improve the smart grid security. Focusing on signal processing techniques, this article introduces an adaptive scheme on detection of injected bad data at the control center. This scheme takes the power measurements of two sequential data collection slots into account, and detects data injection attacks by monitoring the measurement variations and state changes between the two time slots. The proposed scheme has the capability of adaptively detecting attacks including both non-stealthy attacks and stealthy attacks. Stealthy attacks are proved impossible to detect using conventional residual- based methods, and can cause more dangerous effects on power systems than non-stealthy attacks. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme can also be used for attack classification to help system operators prioritize their actions to better protect their systems, and is therefore very valuable in practical smart grid systems.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067689","","Transmission line measurements;Power measurement;Smart grids;Power transmission lines;Sensors;State estimation;Energy management;Internet of Things;Information exchange","energy conservation;energy consumption;power engineering computing;power measurement;power system measurement;power system security;security of data;signal processing;smart power grids","stealthy attacks;power systems;nonstealthy attacks;attack classification;system operators;defense mechanisms;data injection attacks;smart grid networks;intelligence;cyber systems;power grid;smart grid security;injected bad data;sequential data collection slots;bidirectional information exchange;energy consumption;energy efficiency;cyber security challenges;signal processing;control center;power measurements;measurement variations","","33","","15","IEEE","13 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Proceedings of the","6 Feb 2003","2003","","","10 pp.","","Current techniques towards information security have limited capabilities to detect and counter attacks that involve different kinds of masquerade and spread of misinformation executed over long time periods to achieve malicious goals. Detection of such deceptive information obtained during online interactions (emails, chat room conversations) is the first step before counter strategies can be developed. With the large-scale use of information technologies as a general communication medium, facilitating deception detection is a key enabler to utilizing information systems to their fullest potential. This article presents a framework for computer-aided deception detection building on the interpersonal deception theory (IDT) of human interpersonal communication research and text-processing techniques for facilitating deception analysis of text-oriented communication. A state-transition diagram based framework is proposed to model the dynamic evolution of an interpersonal conversation between a sender and receiver based on the IDT-based process schemata. The framework is then utilized to develop a deception detection agent to process textual information. Deception detection is defined as a process of model verification. Architecture of a prototype under development and open problems for further research in this area are outlined.","","0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1173789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1173789","","Humans;Consumer electronics;Wire;Counting circuits;Decision making;Electronic mail;Web and internet services;Radar detection;Information security;Large-scale systems","text analysis;electronic mail;information use;formal verification;security of data","autonomous deception detection;information security;online interactions;electronic mails;chat room conversations;information technology;computer-aided deception detection;interpersonal deception theory;human interpersonal communication;text processing;deception analysis;text-oriented communication;state-transition diagram;model verification","","8","2","22","IEEE","6 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The approach utilizes coinciding as well as unused transitions in the state transition graph of the design.

State estimation (SE) is one of fundamental components in smart grid that evaluates the operation state of a grid by using a set of sensor measurements and grid topologies. A major issue is the authenticity of the measurements collected by the sensors. Specifically, the false data injection attack (FDIA) aims to temper the information that reflect the grid operation state. In this paper, we propose an efficient prediction-based FDIA detection and location scheme, PDL, in which the state vector of smart grid can be represented as multivariate time series, and can be predicted by vector autoregressive processes (VAR) through intentionally exploiting the temporal and spatial correlations of states. Different from most previous works which assumed the state transfer matrix constant and diagonal, a time-varying and non-diagonal matrix is adopted in this scheme. Then, the consistency between the predicted measurements and the observed measurements is utilized to detect and locate abnormal data. Besides, the detected abnormal data can be replaced with the predicted data, which simplifies the calibration process. Extensive simulation results verify the performance of the proposed scheme.","0730-3157","978-1-5386-2667-2","10.1109/COMPSAC.2018.10317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8377945","False data injection attack, state estimation, prediction, smart grid","Transmission line measurements;Current measurement;Smart grids;State estimation;Power measurement;Mathematical model;Covariance matrices","autoregressive processes;fault diagnosis;Internet of Things;matrix algebra;observers;power engineering computing;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;smart power grids;time series","detected abnormal data;smart grid;complex cyber-physical systems;smart devices;state estimation;grid topologies;grid operation state;state vector;predicted measurements;power systems;prediction-based false data injection attack detection;prediction-based FDIA detection;state transfer matrix constant;time-varying nondiagonal matrix","","11","","17","IEEE","22 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the wireless interface through jamming prevents the secondary control system from performing its main tasks, which might compromise the stability of the MG. In this paper, we propose novel, robust and secure secondary control reconfiguration strategy, tailored to counteract DoS attacks. Specifically, upon detecting the impairment of the wireless interface, the jammed secondary control agent notifies its peers via a secure, low-rate powerline channel based on Power Talk communication. This triggers reconfiguration of the wireless communication graph through primary control mode switching, where the jammed agents leave the secondary control by switching to current source mode, and are replaced by non-jammed current sources that switch to voltage source mode and join the secondary control. The strategy fits within the software-defined networking framework, where the network control is split from the data plane using reliable and secure side power talk communication channel, created via software modification of the MG primary control loops. The simulation results illustrate the feasibility of the solution and prove that the MG resilience and performance can be indeed improved via software-defined networking approaches.","2474-9133","978-1-5090-1525-2","10.1109/ICCW.2017.7962775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7962775","","Voltage control;Jamming;Wireless communication;Computer crime;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Switches","carrier transmission on power lines;distributed control;distributed power generation;jamming;power control;power generation control;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;wireless channels","antijamming strategy;distributed microgrid control;power talk communication channel;distributed secondary control reconfiguration system;DC microgrid;MG;off-the-shelf wireless interface solution;IEEE 802.11 standard;denial of service attack;DoS attack;stability;low-rate powerline channel;wireless communication;primary control mode switching;current source mode;nonjammed current source;voltage source mode;security;software-defined networking approach","","7","","18","IEEE","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to some defects of the existing COE mechanism, the functional integrity and security for communication could not be guaranteed. Thus, Safe-COE architecture is designed in this paper. First, safe communication problems in systems are analyzed. Then, based on the Security and Safety Modeling (SESAMO) method, safe building blocks for communication are designed and combining these building blocks with Safe-COE mechanism, a kind of Safe-COE communication architecture is proposed. Finally, communication performance is tested based on this architecture. The results show that based on the general Ethernet MII bus interface, the minimum communication cycle could reach 125 μs , and the minimum synchronization accuracy of peripherals control could be about 100 ns. Moreover, the formal modeling method is used to verify the safe integrity of this architecture. The results show that the architecture could meet related safe requirements of attack protection, data validation, disconnect monitoring, and state switching. Currently, there is no safe communication architecture for a distributed control system that could fully meet related standards and consider both functional safety and information security. It could provide a theoretical basis and solution for safe communication in the distributed control system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926650","Ministry of Science and Technology of China(grant numbers:2015CB057503); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8754702","COE communication protocol;distributed control system;formalized modeling method;real-time Ethernet bus;SESAMO building blocks","Real-time systems;Ethernet;Safety;Protocols;Security;Decentralized control;Architecture","control engineering computing;controller area networks;distributed control;local area networks;protocols;synchronisation;telecommunication security","safe communication architecture;real-time Ethernet distributed control system;functional integrity;safe communication problems;safe building blocks;Safe-COE mechanism;Safe-COE communication architecture;communication performance;general Ethernet MII bus interface;minimum communication cycle;peripherals control;functional safety;information security;COE mechanism;CAN open protocol;time 100.0 ns","","5","","32","CCBY","3 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The main purpose of this framework is to maintain good speed scalability and power efficiency over the number of processor cores under severe hardware restrictions for embedded use. Key to the speed scalability is reduction of a communication overhead with parallelized tasks. A data-categorization scheme enables small-overhead cache-coherency maintenance by using directives and instructions from the compiler. In this scheme, the number of cache-flushing time is minimized and parallelized tasks are quickly synchronized by using flags in local memory. As regards power efficiency, to reduce power consumption, power supply to processor cores waiting for other cores is timely and frequently cut off, even in the middle of an application, by using a timely-power- gating scheme. In this scheme, to achieve quick mode transition between ""NORMAL"" mode and ""RESUME POWEROFF"" mode, register values of the processor core are stored in core-local memory, which is active even in ""RESUME POWEROFF"" mode and can be accessed in one or two clock cycles. Measured speed and power of an application show good speed scalability in execution time and high power efficiency, simultaneously. In the case of a secure AAC-LC encoding program, execution speed when eight processor cores are used can be increased by 4.85 times compared to that of sequential execution. Moreover, power consumption under the same condition can be reduced by 51.0% by parallelizing and timely-power gating. The time for mode transition is less than 20 micro seconds, which is only 2.5% of the ""RESUME POWER-OFF"" period.","2332-5690","978-1-4244-4961-3","10.1109/ICPP.2009.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362472","power-gating;low-power;parallelization","Multicore processing;Scalability;Resumes;Energy consumption;Hardware;Synchronization;Power supplies;Registers;Clocks;Power measurement","cache storage;multiprocessing programs;program compilers;security of data;software maintenance;system-on-chip","green multicore-SoC software-execution;timely-power-gating scheme;octo-core chip multiprocessor;automatic multigrain-parallelizing compiler;OSCAR;data-categorization scheme;cache-coherency maintenance;secure AAC-LC encoding program","","1","","20","IEEE","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such inefficiencies are undesirable and impractical, and are compounded for RESTful service orchestrations in data-intensive industries such as Big Data analytics, cloud computing and life sciences. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive novel technique, Fast-Optimised-REST (FOREST), which enables RESTful services to overcome the traditional bottlenecks experienced during transfer of large sets of data.

Among all the consequences of this globalization trend, the possible existence of stealthy-inserted hardware Trojans (HTs) has raised a great security concern. Without the awareness of the end users or the original designers of host circuits, HTs are usually inserted stealthily at one of the outsourced design or fabrication stages, remain (almost) harmless to the host on dormant mode, and upon triggered will disturb the functions and/or leak the secrets carried by the host. It could become a serious security leak of the systems built on top of infected chips. Identifying whether a circuit carries an HT is thus of the utmost importance to mission-critical applications. Speaking from the point of HT designers, nets with extreme state probabilities could be used to create rare state combination for the purpose of HT triggering. Besides, HT designers seek nets with low switching probabilities to insert their HTs in order not to increase power leakage. We denote the nets with extreme state probability as extreme nets and the nets with low switching probability as inactive nets. It is commonly believed that in order to minimize the chance of accidental triggering or power analysis, they would be better to choose, among all the nets of the host, the nets that with extreme state probabilities (extreme nets) or the nets that barely switch (inactive nets) to construct the trigger parts of their HTs, respectively. However, a net of a circuit experiences very different state probabilities and switching probabilities on test mode and function mode, and existing works have only considered the former. The nets with low activeness on both test mode and function mode hence will be the “best candidates.” In this paper we will first build the ground on finding the nets with low activeness on function mode, and then propose a fast heuristic method approach. The method runs in minimal complexity, has high accuracy, and is tested on popular benchmarks and large-sized circuits.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2017.2753201","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:106112016CDJZR185512); NSFC(grant numbers:61772092); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8039222","Hardware Trojan (HT);nets activeness;state transition;total state","Switches;Hardware;Fabrication;Registers;Trojan horses;Globalization;Market research","integrated circuit design;invasive software;microprocessor chips","potential trigger detection;stealthy-inserted hardware Trojans;HT designers;extreme state probability;HT triggering;low switching probability;accidental triggering power analysis;function mode;IC industry;serious security leak;mission-critical applications;rare state combination;heuristic method approach;large-sized circuits","","11","","23","IEEE","18 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two information flow properties that have been studied in the context of state transition systems, non-interference and opacity, are reformulated in the current context of policy languages. A comparison between these properties reveals that opacity is the more useful, and more general of the two; indeed, it is shown that non-interference can be stated in terms of opacity. The paper then presents an inference system for non-opacity, or detectability, in Datalog-based policies.

The evolutionary properties of viruses are taken into account in the model by the formal rule that previously immunized or cured nodes, at some interval (the size of which is the model parameter), can be re-infected, and exposure of antivirus protection has a lag time (also is a model parameter). In this model, it was accepted that any network node could be in one of three states: in a protected (immunized) state; in an infected state; in a neutral state. In a neutral state, the node may be infected or immunized. In an immunized state, the node can send out antiviruses, which cures infected and immunizes neutral nodes. In this state, copies of antiviruses (useful viruses) are sent out to the nodes of the network randomly chosen (random choice in the address space indicates of the stochastic behavior). In an infected state, the node can send out copies of viruses to nodes in the network, also by randomly selecting in the address space (this also shows the stochastic behavior). The stochastic dynamics model of the spread of evolving viruses in the computer network was described graphically using a diagram of possible transitions between nodes states which allow one to create a system of kinetic differential equations describing these processes. One of the advantages of the model being developed is the ability to modify and expand it by creating more complex state change graphs and transitions between them. This provides supplementing the system of kinetic equations with a member that considers the overall increasing in the number of users and devices in computer networks over time that can be described by a function of any kind.","","978-1-7281-6700-8","10.1109/CSCMP45713.2019.8976837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8976837","evolving computer viruses;virus outbreaks dynamics;lag times;logistic growth","","computer network security;differential equations;graph theory;invasive software;microorganisms;stochastic processes","neutral nodes;stochastic behavior;infected state;stochastic dynamics model;evolving viruses;computer network;transitions;dynamic model;stochastic spread;immunized cured nodes;antivirus protection;network node;immunized state;computer networks;kinetic differential equations;state change graphs","","","","17","IEEE","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we classify system layers based on their common, coupled, and shared functions. Also, interactions between the classified layers are identified, characterized, and clustered based on their impact on the system. Furthermore, based on the overall function of each layer and types of its components, intra-actions within layers are characterized.

In this paper, a fragile model is developed to evaluate the nodal SCF probability considering the insulation aging of equipment and extreme weather condition. Then, a response framework for extreme weather events is developed for a transmission system to defend the cascading impacts of expected SCFs. Specifically, switches are shifted to restrain the out-of-range short-circuit currents (SCCs) so that to ensure the SCFs can be removed by circuit breakers, generation rescheduling and load shedding are arranged to maintain the post-fault system transient stability. The above measures are optimized simultaneously by an integrated Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP). Considering the error or uncertainty of weather event forecasts, a multi-state model is established to provide the most cost-effective grid resilience enhancement scheme, in which the expected urgent adaptions of the initial scheme subject to weather state transition is included in the overall cost.

However, writing a least privilege policy can be hard and error prone for cloud service providers. In this paper, we propose a framework called Least Privilege for Cloud (LPCloud) to address these concerns. LPCloud automatically produces policies for minimization of administrators' privileges at the granularity of representational state transfer (REST) application program interfaces (API), and enforces the policies without affecting current systems. Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithm to partition privileges based on dependencies between API calls. This paper presents design of LPCloud, including a service called Policy Generator which produces partitioned policies and a component named Policy Enforcer to enforce the policies.

Since data transmissions are susceptible to malicious attacks, jammers of adversaries can successfully block their victim’s communications by transmitting interfering signals to legitimate transmissions. Nowadays, owing to the ability to reconfigure the wireless propagation medium, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is regarded as an effective tool to enhance transmission performance, especially in the jamming context. This paper considers the anti-jamming communication tactical scenario of a solar-powered RIS network, in which the RIS is used to improve the uplink transmission performance between a wireless device (WD) and a base station (BS). We investigate the long-term anti-jamming communications of the WD powered by a solar energy harvester. Our objective is to jointly assign the optimal amount of transmission energy and the RIS phase shifts to maximize the data rate of the system in the long run. To this end, we formulate an anti-jamming communication optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) framework and then design a deep Q network (DQN)-based algorithm to generate an optimal policy. As a result, the optimal resource allocation is achieved through trial-and-error interactions with environment by observing the predefined rewards and the network state transition. The Python simulation results conducted by averaging 104 time slots show that the proposed algorithm is not only able to learn from environment, but also yields better performance than baseline schemes under network changes. Moreover, the performance of RIS communication schemes is verified to be superior to that of without-RIS communication schemes in the jamming context.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3158751","Basic Science Research Program(grant numbers:2020R1I1A3057142); Priority Research Center Program through the National Research Foundation(grant numbers:2019R1A6A1A03032988); Underground City of the Future Program funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732955","Reconfigurable intelligent surface;deep reinforcement learning;Markov decision process;solar-powered network;jamming attack;battlefield surveillance","Jamming;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Communication system security;Sensors;Resource management;Uplink","deep learning (artificial intelligence);electromagnetic wave propagation;energy harvesting;intelligent materials;jamming;Markov processes;military communication;military computing;optimisation;resource allocation;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor networks;battlefield surveillance;target tracking;local sensor nodes;tactical decisions;wireless propagation medium;reconfigurable intelligent surface;jamming context;solar-powered RIS network;wireless device;solar energy harvester;RIS phase shifts;Markov decision process framework;deep Q network-based algorithm;resource allocation;network state transition;RIS communication schemes;DQN-based algorithm;long-term antijamming communications;antijamming communication optimization problem;antijamming communication tactical scenario","","1","","34","CCBY","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Intelligent attackers can carefully design a destructive and stealthy false data injection attack (FDIA) sequence such that commonly used weighted least squares estimator combined with residual-based detection method is vulnerable to the FDIA. To effectively defend against an FDIA, in this paper, we propose a robust deviation-based detection method, in which an additional Kalman filter is introduced while retaining the original weighted least squares estimator, so that there are two state estimators. Moreover, an exponential weighting function is also applied to the introduced Kalman filter in our proposed method. When an FDIA occurs, the estimation results of weighted least squares estimator depend only on meter measurements at each time slot, but there is an adjustment process of estimated states for the Kalman filter based on historical states' transitions. Meanwhile, based on the exponential weighting function, estimated measurements in the Kalman filter can be adaptively suppressed for different attack strengths of FDIAs, and then the difference of the results of these two estimators increases.

In reality IMS based Telecom and Internet based Web 2.0 networks have their own advantages and need to co-exist to create an enriched user experience. The convergence of IP Multimedia subsystem (IMS) based Telecom and Web 2.0 based networks is slowly gaining momentum. IMS primarily provides an access agnostic network to securely access a variety of communication services with guaranteed Quality of Service (Qos). Web 2.0 on the other hand has provided a different dimension by acting as a platform for creation of innovative community services in a networked world. IMS standardization body Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), has envisioned the need of a service broker to leverage the IMS capabilities in the converged world. IMS as an overlay network that bridges across various wire line and wireless networks, IMS uses gateway Application Servers to access services from outside networks. This paper explores the benefits of using a Service Broker as a gateway for enabling Web 2.0 applications to create context aware Mashups in the Converged IMS and Web 2.0 world. The proposed architecture models the Service Broker, i.e. Service Control interaction Manager (SCIM) to securely access and operate on the user's mobile context in a simple way using Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern. The goal of the architecture is to leverage the rich user information available across disparate applications in the IMS world in a simple and convenient manner to be accessed by the Web 2.0 Mashup to enrich the user's communication experience in the converged network. A use case on healthcare has been successfully implemented on the IIIT Bangalore IMS Innovation Centre test bed to test the above proposed concept.","","978-1-4244-7932-0","10.1109/IMSAA.2010.5729412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5729412","IMS;Service Broker;SCIM;Web 2.0;REST;Blended Services","Context;Medical services;Servers;XML;Logic gates;Context modeling;Mobile communication","authorisation;Internet;internetworking;IP networks;mobile computing;multimedia servers;multimedia systems;subscriber loops","IMS service broker;SCIM;REST;Web 2.0 Mashup;telecom based service provider;Internet;IP multimedia subsystem;Web 2.0 network;access agnostic network;communication service;quality of service;third generation partnership project;overlay network;wire line;wireless networks;gateway application server;context aware Mashup;service control interaction manager;access security;representational state transfer architectural pattern;healthcare;HIT Bangalore IMS Innovation Centre test bed","","","","11","IEEE","10 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

TBAS is based on the simple idea of comparing the channel states embedded in packets received within a short interval and discarding the packets if the channel state change is above a reasonable level for the interval. We leverage the packet transmission policies in Wi-Fi to actively elicit packets for the channel state check without modifying the Wi-Fi protocol, such as sending a dummy data packet which will automatically elicit an acknowledgement packet. Comparing to the existing methods that wait passively for the packets from the packet sender for the channel state information, TBAS has the full control of time to collect the channel state, such that it can use stricter rules to classify the packets and achieve higher security. We solve key problems in TBAS, including a Channel State Check (CSC) procedure which determines if two packets are from the same sender, as well as a simple protocol wrapped around CSC to reduce the overhead. We implement TBAS on the Sora software defined ratio and our trace-driven emulations show that TBAS can achieve desirable False Positive and False Negative ratios with very low overhead.","","978-1-5090-1732-4","10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7733021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7733021","","Probes;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Physical layer;Authentication;Protocols;OFDM;History","cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","time bounded anti-spoofing;TBAS;spoof detection method;Wi-Fi networks;channel states;channel state change;packet transmission policies;dummy data packet;acknowledgement packet;channel state information;channel state check procedure;CSC procedure;Sora software defined ratio;trace-driven emulations;false positive ratios;false negative ratios","","6","","20","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since it stores the system states and controls system functionality, security vulnerabilities of FSM have been exploited extensively. Among the potential attacks, fault inject attack (FIA) is one of the most severe and most challenging to defend against. Unlike existing countermeasures, we propose a novel structure for FSM state flip flop design that can mitigate any kind of timing based FIAs. Our key idea is to sample the flip flop input signals multiple times during one clock cycle, and then compare these values to determine the correct one. This can effectively defeat all the FIAs based on violating FSM state setup time constraint. In addition, such design will make the design more robust against jitters. In order to reduce the design overhead, we use the low-cost transmission gates to implement the proposed latch and flip flop. We use Hspice to simulate the error conditions with delayed input data and jitter and the results confirm that our design is error resilient. We also implement the FSM in AES with our proposed flip flops and compare the area overhead with existing FIA countermeasures. Results show that the two state-of-the-art approaches have 2X and 4X area overhead than ours.","2164-1706","978-1-7281-8746-4","10.1109/SOCC49529.2020.9524779","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672182); AFOSR(grant numbers:FA9550-14-1-0351); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524779","Fault injection;Setup time violation;FSM;State transition;State flip-flop","Latches;Jitter;Master-slave;System-on-chip;Registers;Circuit faults;Time factors","clocks;finite state machines;flip-flops;logic design;network synthesis","controls system functionality;potential attacks;fault inject attack;FSM state flip flop design;flip flop input signals multiple times;violating FSM state setup time constraint;low-cost transmission gates;flip flops;existing FIA countermeasures;low-cost fault injection attack resilient FSM design;finite state machine;digital circuit design;system states","","","","14","IEEE","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent development in the Internet infrastructure has introduced prosperous in-network computation resources across the network. To exploit such distributed resources, in this article, we propose a core-graphbased framework, called FRank, for fast node ranking algorithms, which accelerates convergence and reduces communication cost by converting most inter-partition state change propagations into intra-partition ones.

These models also generalize the monotonic transform model of Sandhu, and its non-monotonic extension (NMT) by Sandhu and Suri. The authors argue that NMT is inadequate for expressing the document release example discussed by Sandhu and Suri, because it can test only one access matrix cell in its state changing commands. They then analyze the relative expressive power of testing two access matrix cells in state changing commands versus testing more than two.

Following the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, IoT devices need to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover from cyber-attacks, unauthorized access, and other security threats.

Erasure is a way of strengthening confidentiality by upgrading data confidentiality levels, up to the extreme of demanding the removal of secret data from the system. In this paper, we propose a certification technique for confidentiality of complete Java classes that includes non-interference and erasure policies. This technique is based on rewriting logic, which is a very general logical and semantic framework that is efficiently implemented in the high-level programming language Maude. In order to achieve a finite state transition system, we develop an abstract Java semantics which correctly approximates non-interference and erasure. The analysis produces certificates that are independently checkable, and are small enough to be used in practice. We have implemented our methodology and developed some experiments that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.","","978-1-4244-9816-1","10.1109/SYNASC.2010.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715278","program verification;confidentiality;non interference;erasure;rewriting logic;abstract interpretation","Java;Semantics;Instruments;Equations;Safety;Observers;Influenza","finite state machines;high level languages;Java;rewriting systems;security of data","rewriting logic;semantic program;secret data;data confidentiality;high level programming language;finite state transition system;Java","","1","","21","IEEE","17 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing defense against A2 Trojans mainly relies on runtime detection mechanism which needs large monitor hardware overhead and complicated identification/handling software. To address these limitations, this article proposes a built-in structure to accelerate the activation of A2 Trojans, which consists of several composite-logic ring oscillators and a multiple-purpose controller. In addition, two post-fabrication detection schemes named time-division mode-switching (TDMS) and scan-based fault test compatible (SFTC) are proposed. TDMS detection scheme can discover A2 Trojans when running functional patterns by inserting oscillating operations every other cycle. SFTC detection scheme can detect A2 Trojans during scan-based fault test by introducing oscillation before each capture operation. Evaluations across a wide range of A2 Trojans and benchmarks show that our proposal is more power-efficient and area-saving compared with existing monitor structure.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2020.2977069","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61832018); Science and Technology Planning Project of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019RS2027); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9018186","A2 Trojan;accelerate activation;oscillator;security;trojan detection","Trojan horses;Payloads;Hardware;Registers;Monitoring;Detectors;Acceleration","controllers;integrated circuit design;invasive software;oscillators;production engineering computing;semiconductor industry","hardware Trojan attacks;design strategy;A2 Trojan detection;built-in acceleration structure;semiconductor industry;digital logic;runtime detection mechanism;composite-logic ring oscillators;multiple-purpose controller;post-fabrication detection schemes;time-division mode-switching;TDMS;scan-based fault test compatible;SFTC;oscillating operations;power-efficiency","","7","","34","IEEE","28 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model provides for enforcement of access control protocols through FSM specification on units of data that can vary in size from one region of memory to another. Threads executing transactions do not explicitly request locks on data items-they simply access the data items while locking is performed automatically and in many instances without software intervention. This is facilitated by hardware assistance in that the FSM definitions and lock unit state information is stored in caches. Only when a thread is suspended are the state changes communicated to the software lock manager. Delays for lock acquisitions through the MVM model architecture are determined and compared to delays due to lock acquisition by a conventional lock manager.","1098-8068","0-8186-8114-4","10.1109/IDEAS.1997.625700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=625700","","Access protocols;Access control;Hardware;Protection;Yarn;Memory management;Operating systems;Computer architecture;Delay;Resource management","concurrency control;distributed databases;network operating systems;transaction processing;authorisation;security of data;memory protocols;finite state machines;cache storage;storage management;database theory","multi-view memory model;OS locking;operating system locking;transaction processing systems;access control protocols;FSM specification;threads;lock unit state information;cache;software lock manager;delays;MVM model architecture;lock acquisition;concurrency control;finite state machines","","1","14","39","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the framework's release, Noise-based protocols have been adopted by WhatsApp, WireGuard and other high-profile applications. We present Noise Explorer, an online engine for designing, reasoning about, formally verifying and implementing arbitrary Noise Handshake Patterns. Based on our formal treatment of the Noise Protocol Framework, Noise Explorer can validate any Noise Handshake Pattern and then translate it into a model ready for automated verification and also into a production-ready software implementation written in Go or in Rust. We use Noise Explorer to analyze more than 57 handshake patterns. We confirm the stated security goals for 12 fundamental patterns and provide precise properties for the rest. We also analyze unsafe handshake patterns and document weaknesses that occur when validity rules are not followed. All of this work is consolidated into a usable online tool that presents a compendium of results and can parse formal verification results to generate detailed-but-pedagogical reports regarding the exact security goals of each message of a Noise Handshake Pattern with respect to each party, under an active attacker and including malicious principals.

DIFUZZRTL develops a register-coverage guided fuzzing technique, which efficiently yet correctly identifies a state transition in the finite state machine of RTL designs. DIFUZZRTL also develops several new techniques in consideration of unique RTL design characteristics, including cycle-sensitive register coverage guiding, asynchronous interrupt events handling, a unified CPU input format with Tilelink protocols, and drop-in-replacement designs to support various CPU RTLs. We implemented DIFUZZRTL, and performed the evaluation with three real-world open source CPU RTLs: OpenRISC Mor1kx Cappuccino, RISC-V Rocket Core, and RISC-V Boom Core. During the evaluation, DIFUZZRTL identified 16 new bugs from these CPU RTLs, all of which were confirmed by the respective development communities and vendors.

Vehicles can exchange information to extend their perception horizon, exchange driving modes to enhance scene understanding and most importantly cooperate directly with other automated and autonomous vehicles in cooperative driving maneuvers such as platooning. In this paper we present a novel communication protocol built on the current vehicular communication standard IEEE 802.11p, which enables negotiation and execution of cooperative driving maneuvers based on distributed state machines.

The result is a new paradigm known as distributed trust; this article attempts to survey that landscape. ""Divide and conquer"" can be a powerful tool for disentangling complexity when designing a computing system. However, some aspects of system design are inseparable. Treating these as though they were independent leads to one interfering with the other, and ""divide and be conquered"" perhaps better characterizes the consequences. For some years, we have been investigating how to construct systems that continue functioning despite component failures and attacks. A question we have pondered is to what extent does divide and conquer apply? Somewhat less than you might hope is, unfortunately, the answer. One could argue that attacks can be seen as just another cause for component failure. The Byzantine fault model asserts that a faulty component can exhibit arbitrarily malicious (so-called ""Byzantine"") behavior; a system that tolerates Byzantine faults should then be able to handle anything. Moreover, because any component can be viewed abstractly in terms of its state and a set of possible next-state transitions - in short, a state machine - fault-tolerant services can be built by assembling enough state-machine copies so that outputs from the ones exhibiting Byzantine behavior are outvoted by the correctly functioning ones. The fault-tolerance of the ensemble thus exceeds the fault-tolerance of any individual state machine, and a distributed fault-tolerance is the result. A closer look at such replicated state machines, however, reveals problems ""when attacks are possible. Specific difficulties with the approach and how we can overcome these are described later in this article, but the overall vision remains compelling: place more trust in an ensemble than in any of its individual components. In analogy with distributed fault-tolerance, then, we are seeking ways to implement distributed trust.","1558-4046","","10.1109/MSP.2005.125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514398","cryptography;trusted systems;state machines","Cryptography;Computer security;Privacy;Resists;Hardware;Cryptographic protocols;Computational modeling;Distributed computing;Computer crime","security of data;software fault tolerance;client-server systems;divide and conquer methods;finite state machines","trustworthy service;replicated state machine;distributed trust;divide and conquer method;computing system design;Byzantine fault model;faulty component;fault-tolerant services;distributed fault-tolerance","","13","3","37","IEEE","3 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This article proposes a general framework to establish a systematic procedure for comparing different formulations. We apply the procedure to the three current state-of-the-art formulations in this context: tight and compact (TC), state transition (ST), and projected two-binary-variable (2bin). We carry out an exhaustive analysis over 54 problem instances of very different sizes (10 to 1888 generators) and time scopes (24 and 168h), for four alternative definitions of additional constraints. Our results favor the TC formulation in general in terms of the integrality gap and CPU time.

The secondary users (SUs) can concurrently access the same band as the primary users (PUs) using an underlay protocol provided that the transmit power of SUs keeps below the maximum tolerable interference threshold at PUs. On the other hand, we utilize maximal ratio combining (MRC) scheme at the secondary relays and maximal ratio transmission (MRT) scheme at the secondary destination to improve the secrecy performance due to the fact that the eavesdropper can intercept the secondary network communication. The max-link relay selection scheme is also adopted to enhance the secrecy performance by selecting the best link among all available source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for secrecy outage probability by modeling the dynamic buffer state transitions as the Markov chain. The findings of this paper demonstrate that multi-antenna relaying networks yield to better secrecy performance than single antenna relaying networks.

Further, we obtain the dynamic equations of the transition between nodes and the calculation formula of node availability. The simulation result is that when the degree of node is small and the node vulnerability function is a power function, the node availability is the highest; when the degree of node is large and the node vulnerability function satisfies the exponential function and the power function, the node availability is high. Therefore, when constructing a NBIOT-HWSNs network, node protection is implemented according to the degree of node, so that when the node vulnerability function satisfies the power function, all nodes can maintain high availability, thus making the entire network more stable.","","978-1-7281-0120-0","10.1109/ICSAI.2018.8599320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599320","Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks;NB-IoT;malware;node availability","Wireless sensor networks;Security;Mathematical model;Malware;Mobile communication;Markov processes;Monitoring","Internet of Things;invasive software;Markov processes;wireless sensor networks","node protection;node availability;node state transition model;vulnerability differences;node distribution;node heterogeneity model;NB-IoT;heterogeneous wireless sensor networks;nodes availability analysis;power function;node vulnerability function","","","","18","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tremendous pressure on today's enterprises to achieve and sustain competitive advantage has led to heightened efforts to protect sensitive information. Many enterprises have recognized that the key to sensitive information management improvement lies in the better access control model. In this paper, we present a boundary-based access control model incorporating an advanced security mechanism, in order to support fine-grained authorizations in the right time for the provision of services, based on the analysis of system boundary. In this model, access permissions are controlled by the state transitions at different layers including workflow layers, control layers and data layers. The access control mechanism is based on an RBAC model, which incorporates dynamic context information. Context is classified based on the analysis of system boundary into six main categories, which is further categorized as simple condition and composite condition, thus forming a multi-level context. In a multi-level hierarchy of context conditions, the access control model is implemented dynamically, by checking the context constraint associated with each access task at the time of the specific request submission, whose functionality and the constituent parts have been described formally and in detail.","","978-0-7695-3600-2","10.1109/IFITA.2009.274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5232219","system boundary;access control;multi-level context","Access control;Authorization;Permission;Protection;Context modeling;Information technology;Information management;Shipbuilding industry;Data security;Information security","authorisation","boundary-based access control model;sensitive information protection;information management;advanced security mechanism;fine-grained authorization;workflow layers;control layers;data layers;RBAC model","","","","6","IEEE","4 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The unavailability of middlebox is a key metric. The previous study considers allocating backup servers to middleboxes to reduce the unavailability. While it adopts shared protection to save backup capacity, resource sharing has not been sufficiently explored as each middlebox can only use one backup server. This paper presents a backup allocation model in which a function can be protected by two backup servers and a backup server can protect multiple functions under a shared protection strategy to minimize the maximum unavailability among functions. We use Markov chains to analyze the state transitions and make equilibrium-state equations. By solving them, we obtain the probability of each state of the allocation and compute an unavailability of function. We introduce two algorithms to examine the proposed model; one of them uses the performance bound of the maximum unavailability which is analyzed in this paper. Numerical results show that the proposed model reduces the maximum unavailability by 13.9-51.2% compared to a baseline model that allocates one backup server for each middlebox in our examined cases.","2693-9789","978-1-6654-0694-9","10.1109/NetSoft54395.2022.9844095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9844095","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Markov processes;Middleboxes;Mathematical models;Software;Numerical models","computer network reliability;computer network security;Markov processes;network servers;resource allocation;virtualisation","two-stage shared protection;general-purpose server;network function virtualization;backup server;backup capacity;shared protection strategy;maximum unavailability;unavailability-aware backup allocation model;middleboxes;resource sharing;Markov chains;state transitions;equilibrium-state equations","","","","21","IEEE","3 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By decoupling NFs from physical devices, network function virtualization enables virtual network functions (VNF) to run in virtual machines (VMs). However, VNFs are vulnerable to various faults such as software and hardware failures. To enhance VNF fault tolerance, the deployment of backup VNFs in stand-by VM instances is necessary. In case of stateful VNFs, stand-by instances require constant state updates from active instances during its operation. This will guarantee a correct and seamless handover from failed instances to stand-by instances after failures. Nevertheless, such state updates to stand-by instances could consume significant network bandwidth resources and lead to potential admission failures for VNF requests. In this paper, we study the fault-tolerant VNF placement problem with the optimization objective of admitting as many requests as possible. In particular, the VNF placement of active/stand-by instances, the request routing paths to active instances, and state transfer paths to stand-by instances are jointly considered. We devise an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve this problem, and propose a bicriteria approximation algorithm with performance guarantees for a special case of the problem.

Information exchange occurs only when feedback between the participants of the communication process is possible in media space, and also when each social actor is given the opportunity to act as a subject of media communication. In this case, the possibility of information exchange within the framework of subject-object and subject-subject media communication relations is guaranteed mainly by the digital infrastructure of media tools and media platforms, through which the involvement of social actors in communication processes aimed at the implementation of public management to address socially important issues of life support, social significance and security is ensured. Social media communication is a factor of the digital public administration and forms its main qualitative characteristics and properties. Without the inclusion of actors of the public sphere in the digital media communication processes in the modern realities it is impossible to realize the conditions of the digital public administration, including the assessment of the effectiveness of its implementation and parameters of manageability. In this regard, the media and communication framework of the phenomenon of «governability» in the system of digital public management is the subject of this study. In strategic terms, governability in the system of the digital public administration is determined by its network organization instead of the classical hierarchical forms of interaction of public administration actors (see L.V. Smorgunov. Governability and network public administration, 2014). «Network» concept is considered by various authors in terms of public administration approach, therefore in the scientific literature it is also called the theory of political-management networks. Emerged together with the concept of new public management, the concept of political networks is based on the same postulates: the state changes the usual hierarchical form of administration to a new form of management. The difference between the two approaches lies in the fact that while in the new state management, market relations prevail over hierarchy, in the concept of political networks, communication processes play a key role in managerial and political processes. And, accordingly, the network organization of the digital public administration emerges through communication links of actors in the public sphere, which are formed in the digital media space. Spatial and infrastructural «turn» of digital media communications is considered by the author as a theoretical and methodological constant in identifying the set of factors of public management and the special properties and characteristics of media environments, in which the implementation of digital public management is possible.","2768-4873","979-8-3503-2003-9","10.1109/ComSDS58064.2023.10130416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10130416","Governability;digital public administration;media communications","Seminars;Social networking (online);Semantics;Decision making;Organizations;Media;Security","public administration;social networking (online)","communication links;communication process;digital infrastructure;digital media communication processes;digital media communications;digital media space;digital public administration system;digital public management;information exchange;media communication framework;media environments;media platforms;media tools;network public administration;public administration actors;public administration approach;social actor;social communication;social media communication;subject-subject media communication relations","","","","18","IEEE","25 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, branch predictors are leveraged to trigger mis-speculation in transient execution attacks. In this work, we demonstrate a new class of speculation-based attacks that targets the branch prediction unit (BPU). We find that speculative resolution of conditional branches (i.e., in nested speculation) alter the states of pattern history table (PHT) in modern processors, which are not restored after the corresponding branches are later squashed. Such characteristic allows attackers to exploit the BPU as the secret transmitting medium in transient execution attacks. To evaluate the discovered vulnerability, we build a novel attack framework, BranchSpectre, that enables exfiltration of unintended secrets through observing speculative PHT updates (in the form of covert and side channels). We further investigate the PHT collision mechanism in the history-based predictor and the branch prediction mode transitions in Intel processors. Built upon such knowledge, we implement an ultra-high speed covert channel (BranchSpectre-cc) as well as two side channels (i.e., BranchSpectre-v1 and BranchSpectre-v2) that merely rely on BPU for mis-speculation trigger and secret inference in the speculative domain. Notably, BranchSpectre side channels can take advantage of much simpler code patterns than those used in Spectre attacks. We present an extensive BranchSpectre code gadget analysis on a set of popular real-world application code bases followed by a demonstration of side channel attack on OpenSSL. The evaluation results show substantially wider existence and higher exploitability of BranchSpectre code patterns in real-world software. Finally, we discuss several secure branch prediction mechanisms that can mitigate transient execution attacks exploiting modern branch predictors.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2021.3122830","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-2008339); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9591268","Branch predictor;transient execution attacks;nested speculation;pattern history;side channels","Transient analysis;Program processors;History;Codes;Microarchitecture;Timing;Hardware","cryptography;microprocessor chips;security of data","modern branch predictors;speculative world;transient execution attacks;speculation-based attacks;branch prediction unit;BPU;speculative resolution;conditional branches;nested speculation;attack framework;speculative PHT updates;history-based predictor;branch prediction mode transitions;BranchSpectre-v;speculative domain;spectre attacks;side channel attack;BranchSpectre code patterns;secure branch prediction mechanisms;misspeculation trigger;pattern history table","","4","","56","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All these attacks are centered around a common set of behaviors: During speculative execution, the architectural state of the system is kept unmodified, until the speculation can be verified. In the event that a misspeculation occurs, then anything that can affect the architectural state is reverted (squashed) and re-executed correctly. However, the same is not true for the microarchitectural state. Normally invisible to the user, changes to the microarchitectural state can be observed through various side-channels, with timing differences caused by the memory hierarchy being one of the most common and easy to exploit. The speculative side-channels can then be exploited to perform attacks that can bypass software and hardware checks in order to leak information. These attacks, out of which the most infamous are perhaps Spectre and Meltdown, have led to a frantic search for solutions. In this work, we present our own solution for reducing the microarchitectural state-changes caused by speculative execution in the memory hierarchy. It is based on the observation that if we only allow accesses that hit in the L1 data cache to proceed, then we can easily hide any microarchitectural changes until after the speculation has been verified. At the same time, we propose to prevent stalls by value predicting the loads that miss in the L1. Value prediction, though speculative, constitutes an invisible form of speculation, not seen outside the core. We evaluate our solution and show that we can prevent observable microarchitectural changes in the memory hierarchy while keeping the performance and energy costs at 11% and 7%, respectively. In comparison, the current state of the art solution, InvisiSpec, incurs a 46% performance loss and a 51% energy increase.","2575-713X","978-1-4503-6669-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8980347","speculative execution;side-channel attacks;caches","","cache storage;computer architecture;cryptography;microprocessor chips","invisible speculative execution;high-performance general-purpose CPUs;microarchitectural state-changes;speculative side-channels;architectural state;security attacks;memory hierarchy;value prediction","","","","62","","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the attackers can sometimes infer sensitive information from the patterns of the encrypted network traffic, which poses a threat to network security. Most existing countermeasures are proposed to obfuscate traffic flows using adversarial examples. However, there are two challenges when adding perturbations to live network traffic. Firstly, the perturbations imposed on the feature space cannot be conveniently projected to original traffic flows in feature-space based methods. Secondly, it is laborious and impractical to apply symmetrical framework to encode/decode the adversarial traffic in traffic-space based approaches. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose an asymmetric defending scheme, namely Prism, to protect the live connection privacy against attacks of temporal network traffic analyzers. Specifically, Prism first extracts standardized temporal features via Power-Law Division (PLD) algorithm, and then employs Time-stacked State Transition Model (TSTM) to obtain the fingerprint of each application. Finally, Prism defends against the analyzers with online traffic perturbation. Since the Prism is designed as a traffic-space based defender with asymmetric defending structure, the deployment is lightweight and efficient. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our adversarial perturbations. In particular, it is encouraging to see that our proposed defending scheme outperforms the advanced countermeasures, such as adversarial training and traffic filter.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2023.3267885","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U2003111); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10103708","Traffic analysis;flow correlation;adversarial examples;privacy defense","Perturbation methods;Feature extraction;Privacy;Real-time systems;Encryption;Correlation;Payloads","computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;feature extraction;perturbation techniques;telecommunication traffic","adversarial traffic;application fingerprint;asymmetric defending scheme;encrypted network traffic;feature-space based methods;live network traffic;network monitoring;PLD algorithm;power-law division algorithm;Prism;real-time privacy protection;standardized temporal features;temporal network traffic analyzers;time-stacked state transition model;TSTM","","","","59","IEEE","17 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It characterizes whether a “secret” of a system can be inferred by an outside observer called an “intruder.” We consider the problem of enforcing opacity in partially-observed discrete event systems modeled as automata. We propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output of the system that changes the system's output behavior by inserting additional observable events. The insertion function must respond to the full system's output behavior. Also, the insertion function should not create new observed behavior but only replicate existing observable strings. We define the property of “i-enforceability,” when there exists an insertion function that renders a non-opaque system opaque. To synthesize insertion functions that ensure opacity, we define and construct a new structure called the “All Insertion Structure” (AIS). The AIS can be used to verify if a given opacity property is i-enforceable. The AIS enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in a compact state transition structure. If a given opacity property has been verified to be i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to synthesize an i-enforcing insertion function.","0743-1546","978-1-4673-2066-5","10.1109/CDC.2012.6426760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6426760","","Automata;Observers;Security;Monitoring;Synchronization;Solids;ISO standards","automata theory;discrete event systems;security of data","opacity properties;insertion functions;confidentiality property;security properties;networked systems;partially-observed discrete event systems;automata;enforcement mechanism based;i-enforceability;all insertion structure","","13","","15","IEEE","4 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A set of $N$ sensors make noisy linear observations of a discrete-time linear process with Gaussian noise, and report the observations to a remote estimator. The challenge is the presence of a few potentially malicious sensors which can start strategically manipulating their observations at a random time in order to skew the estimates. The quickest attack detection problem for a known linear attack scheme is posed as a constrained Markov decision process in order to minimize the expected detection delay subject to a false alarm constraint, with the state involving the probability belief at the estimator that the system is under attack. State transition probabilities are derived in terms of system parameters, and the structure of the optimal policy is derived analytically. It turns out that the optimal policy amounts to checking whether the probability belief exceeds a threshold.

In order to take full advantage of the benefits provided by the multiple antennas at the destination and the available relays, we adopt the max-link relay selection scheme and propose a half-duplex and two full-duplex secure transmission schemes for secrecy improvement, i.e., 1) maximal-ratio combining (MRC), 2) maximal-ratio combining/cooperative jamming (MRC/CJ), and 3) zero-forcing beamforming/cooperative jamming (ZFB/CJ).

Moreover, simple and informative asymptotic results are provided under both L → ∞ and L → ∞ scenarios (where L denotes the buffer size), from which we can obtain further insights on the secrecy diversity gain and the secrecy coding gain. The highlights of this paper can be summarized as follows: 1) Under L → ∞ scenario, the secrecy diversity gains of all proposed schemes both reach M. When L → ∞, the secrecy diversity gains of MRC, MRC/CJ and ZFB/CJ increase to M (1 + ND), MND and 2M respectively, where M is the number of relays and ND represents the number of antennas at the destination; 2) The secrecy coding gain of the system differs with different schemes, and it improves with the increase of M and ND under both the two scenarios; and 3) Under the scenario L → ∞, ZFB/CJ outperforms MRC and MRC/CJ across the entire signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range of interest, however, when L→ ∞, ZFB/CJ outperforms MRC/CJ and MRC in the low SNR regime, while the opposite holds in the high SNR regime.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907781","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771487,61371122); National University of Defense Technology(grant numbers:NO.ZS18-02-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8676270","Buffer-aided relay;multi-antenna;full-duplex;secrecy outage probability;secrecy diversity gain;secrecy coding gain","Relays;Jamming;Signal to noise ratio;Diversity methods;Power system reliability;Probability;Antennas","cooperative communication;decode and forward communication;diversity reception;jamming;Markov processes;MIMO communication;probability;relay networks (telecommunication);telecommunication security","secrecy outage performance;DF buffer-aided relaying networks;multiantenna destination;multiple antennas;max-link relay selection scheme;full-duplex secure transmission schemes;secrecy improvement;maximal-ratio combining;jamming;MRC/CJ;secrecy outage probability;dynamic buffer state transitions;informative asymptotic results;buffer size;secrecy diversity gain;secrecy coding gain;ZFB/CJ","","3","","33","OAPA","29 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Deterministic finite automata constructed with the Aho-Corasick algorithm (AC-DFA) have been widely used for solving this problem. However, the state transition table (STT) of a large-scale DBSM AC-DFA can span hundreds of megabytes of system memory, whose limited bandwidth and long latency could become the performance bottleneck We propose a novel partitioning algorithm which converts an AC-DFA into a ¿head¿ and a ¿body¿ parts. The head part behaves as a traditional AC-DFA that matches the pattern prefixes up to a predefined length; the body part extends any head match to the full pattern length in parallel body-tree traversals. Taking advantage of the SIMD instructions in modern x86-64 multi-core processors, we design compact and efficient data structures packing multi-path and multi-stride pattern segments in the body-tree. Compared with an optimized AC-DFA solution, our head-body matching (HBM) implementation achieves 1.2x to 3x throughput performance when the input match (attack) ratio varies from 2% to 32%, respectively. Our HBM data structure is over 20x smaller than a fully-populated AC-DFA for both Snort and ClamAV dictionaries.

An attacker can utilize these vulnerabilities to perform fault injection attacks or insert malicious hardware modifications (Trojan) to gain unauthorized access to some specific states. To our knowledge, no systematic approaches have been proposed to analyze these vulnerabilities in FSM. In this paper, we develop a framework named Analyzing Vulnerabilities in FSM (AVFSM) which extracts the state transition graph (including the don't-care states and transitions) from a gate-level netlist using a novel Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) based approach and quantifies the vulnerabilities of the design to fault injection and hardware Trojan insertion.

Many protocols of opportunistic routing have been proposed to increase transmission reliability and network throughput. Instead of using a dedicated next hop, opportunistic routing can consider multiple downstream nodes as potential forwarders. The decision of which nodes being chosen to forward packets is made by the coordination schema. Although the coordination helps opportunistic routing to deliver opportunistic gains, it requires a batch-based schedule to minimize the cost, which may prevent spatial channel reuse and thus under utilize wireless media. In this paper, we explain the fundamental idea of opportunistic routing and propose a discrete-time Markov chain as a general model to map the transmission process. It demonstrates how to map batch-based packet transmissions in the network with state transitions in a Markov chain.

To address these issues, we propose EFSHARD, an efficient state sharding blockchain system that enables allocating states flexibly and timely across shards according to recent transactions. Firstly, we propose a hierarchical state partition to enable flexible mapping of states to shards. Second, we design a new state transfer protocol to efficiently migrate states across shards while guaranteeing consistency and liveness. Then, we provide a greedy-based state allocation algorithm to decide when and how to migrate states. The allocation mechanism groups highly correlated state data into the same shard to reduce the proportion of cross-shard transactions and distributes state data to shards with relatively low load to balance workload, thus improving the performance. In the end, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate EFSHARD and the results demonstrate that EFSHARD outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of transaction throughput, confirmation latency, workload balance, and queue size of transaction pool.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2023.3236433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10015800","blockchain;sharding;state allocation;state transfer;data partition","Blockchains;Sharding;Resource management;Smart contracts;Security;History;Throughput","","","","","","","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

A large number of applications relate to cellular and mobile telephony, pagers, local area networks, cordless phones, global positioning systems (GPS), and security systems. Pseudo-SAW (PSAW) and high velocity PSAW (HVPSAW) have received great attention because of their high phase velocities and, therefore, the high frequencies of operation that these modes provide. In addition to high phase velocities, the pseudomodes must also present low propagation losses and considerably high electromechanical coupling coefficients to be considered for surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. This paper verifies that the metallic layer thickness is a relevant SAW device parameter, which must be considered to achieve lower losses for high frequency, low loss SAW devices. Popular PSAW and HVPSAW material orientations, such as 64/spl deg/ YX LiNbO/sub 3/ (0/spl deg/-26/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), 36/spl deg/ YX LiTaO/sub 3/ (0/spl deg/ -54/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), LiNbO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 36/spl deg/), LiTaO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 31/spl deg/), and Li/sub 2/B/sub 4/O/sub 7/ (0/spl deg/ 47.3/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/), are considered as examples. In addition to the reduced loss analysis and the dispersion analysis for the pseudo modes, the present work discusses the transitions with respect to the layer thickness from the PSAWs and HVPSAWs to the generalized SAWs (GSAWs) and Rayleigh (sagittal particle motion) modes. In addition to contributing to the knowledge of the pseudomodes behavior with layer thickness, this mode transition analysis enlightens the situation in which the losses in the pseudo modes go to zero because of the merging of the pseudo modes into the SAWs (GSAWs and Rayleigh). The fact that the SAWs are a continuation as a function of thickness for the pseudo modes may be conveniently used in the fabrication of low loss devices. In addition, the effects of heavy layer metals, such as gold, in reducing the layer thickness at which the pseudo modes merge to the SAWs are discussed. Numerical results are compared with experimental data available in the literature, and the present analysis elucidates experimentally observed higher order pseudo modes and values of layer thickness for which lower losses are achieved.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.895914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=895914","","Surface acoustic waves;Surface acoustic wave devices;Frequency;Performance loss;Cellular networks;Telephony;Local area networks;Global Positioning System;Propagation losses;Acoustic waves","surface acoustic wave devices;losses;ultrasonic dispersion","HVPSAW devices;PSAW devices;SAW devices;pseudo-SAW;high velocity PSAW;phase velocities;propagation losses;electromechanical coupling coefficients;metallic layer thickness;dispersion analysis;generalized SAWs;Rayleigh modes;sagittal particle motion;mode transition analysis;LiNbO/sub 3/;LiTaO/sub 3/;Li/sub 2/B/sub 4/O/sub 7/","","6","","19","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given the mounting cyber-attack threats, these critical ICT systems create great security issues for smart grids. Additionally, the clever attackers have the ability to not only access and monitor the smart grid, but also hack it by launching well-established cyber-attacks. Thus, this article is devoted to understanding the potential stealthy cyber-attack and its countermeasure. First, this article proposes a stealthy sparse cyber-attack model in an ac smart grid by considering both the residual test-based detector and the interval-state-estimation-based detector, which is not considered in previous studies. The design model is formulated as a constrained optimization problem by minimizing the number of contaminated meters, where the characteristics of two types of detector are considered simultaneously as the constraints for the first time. A constrained differential evolution (CDE) is proposed as the solver because the optimization problem is NP-hard. Then, a generalized-cumulative-sum-based detector is developed to detect the proposed cyber-attacks, where a fractional-order state transition matrix is originally introduced into the estimator to describe the dynamics of the power system. Numerical studies illustrate the feasibility of CDE-based stealthy sparse cyber-attacks and the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasure.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2021.3129487","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1966202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623481","Constrained differential evolution (CDE);false data injection attack (FDIA);generalized cumulative sum;smart grid security;stealthy sparse cyber-attack","Detectors;Smart grids;Optimization;State estimation;Phasor measurement units;Power system dynamics;Pollution measurement","computer crime;distributed power generation;evolutionary computation;optimisation;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids","ac smart grid;next-generation power grids;advanced information;communication technology;cyber-attack threats;critical ICT systems;clever attackers;countermeasure;stealthy sparse cyber-attack model;residual test-based detector;interval-state-estimation-based detector;constrained optimization problem;constrained differential evolution;generalized-cumulative-sum-based detector;power system;CDE-based stealthy sparse cyber-attacks","","17","","35","IEEE","22 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In any hybrid security system, the human portion needs to trust the machine portion. To do so, both must understand the expected behavior for every state‐how the system can fail and what those failures look like. The machine must be able to communicate its state and have the capacity to alert the humans when an expected state transition doesn't happen as expected. Things will go wrong, either by accident or as the result of an attack, and the humans are going to need to troubleshoot the system in real time‐that requires understanding on both parts. Each time things go wrong, and the machine portion doesn't communicate well, the human portion trusts it a little less. Humans and machines have different strengths. Humans are flexible and can do creative thinking in ways that machines cannot. But they're easily fooled. Machines are more rigid and can handle state changes and process flows much better than humans can.

As the complexity of rule-sets increases, traditional string matching engines are being replaced by more sophisticated regular expression engines. To keep up with line rates, deal with denial of service attacks and provide predictable resource provisioning, the design of such engines must allow examining payload traffic at several gigabits per second and provide worst case speed guarantees. While regular expression matching using deterministic finite automata (DFA) is a well studied problem in theory, its implementation either in software or specialized hardware is complicated by prohibitive memory requirements. This is especially true for DFAs representing complex regular expressions present in practical rule-sets. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to drastically reduce the DFA memory requirement and still provide worst-case speed guarantees. Specifically, we merge several ""non-equivalent"" states in a DFA by introducing labels on their input and output transitions. We then propose a data structure to represent the merged states and the transition labels. We show that, with very few assumptions about the original DFA, such a transformation results in significant compression in the DFA representation. We have implemented a state merging and transition labeling algorithm for DFAs, and show that for Snort and Bro security rule-sets, state merging results in memory reductions of an order of magnitude.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215710","","Merging;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Pattern matching;Intrusion detection;Computer crime;Payloads;Automata;Hardware;Data structures","finite automata;search problems;security of data;telecommunication security","memory-efficient regular expression search;state merging;pattern matching;critical network services;intrusion detection;policy management;rule-sets;string matching engines;regular expression engines;line rates;denial of service attacks;resource provisioning;payload traffic;regular expression matching;deterministic finite automata;DFA memory requirement;non-equivalent states;data structure;merged states;transition labels;transition labeling algorithm","","83","3","18","IEEE","29 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IRI 2004.","23 May 2005","2004","","","467","474","Due to increasing incidents of security breaches in the cyber space, a rigorous user authentication process has become crucial. A very feasible biometric approach to verify the authenticity of a user is to examine his/her typing patterns. There is a significant difference in the keystroke patterns exhibited from person to person, even when asked to type the same words. Typing patterns can be shown in the intervals between keys, holding time, overlap keys, etc. Individuals typing pattern develops naturally and uniquely just as each person write differently. We propose an analytical process based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) to learn the special patterns from individuals, and then to identify them. During training, the timing information of each keystroke is recorded at its holding and releasing events, and the pattern is then extracted from the relationship of the events within a word. The experiment to be conducted is to authenticate users when entering words. The idea is to implement a process to examine the typing pattern as a user enters his/her password, in order to augment the conventional password system. We find the discrete first-order HMM to be very suitable for our purpose. Due to the nondeterministic nature of the keystroke events, modeling with a stochastic process such as the HMM which has probabilistic state transitions can not only recognize the patterns in the keys already typed, but also predict the following sequence. The issue is similar to the recognition of hand-written characters or spoken words. The experimental results are nearly perfect among twenty test subjects all randomly chosen in a controlled environment of a standard computer laboratory.","","0-7803-8819-4","10.1109/IRI.2004.1431505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1431505","","Hidden Markov models;Pattern analysis;Computer security;Authentication;Biometrics;Timing;Data mining;Predictive models;Stochastic processes;Pattern recognition","hidden Markov models;message authentication;biometrics (access control);pattern recognition","hidden Markov model;keystroke pattern analysis;password verification;user authentication process;biometric approach;stochastic process;probabilistic state transition;pattern recognition","","19","","18","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developers' misunderstanding or negligence of RFCs may bring in inconsistency bugs, which could further cause incorrect behaviors, interoperability issues, or critical security implications. Detecting such bugs is difficult as they usually result in silent erroneous effect. Prior work on RFC-directed inconsistency bug detection usually deal with a certain protocol or ad-hoc properties in RFCs. In this paper, we present RIBDetector, an approach focusing on statically and efficiently locating inconsistency bugs that could be triggered by hand-crafted network packets in protocol implementations. Given an implementation, its corresponding RFCs and a user-provided configuration file, our approach automatically extracts rules about packet format, state transition and error handling from RFCs into a uniform format which dictates condition checks that must be performed before taking particular operations. Then we leverage common programming conventions to identify corresponding locations of the conditions and operations in implementations and use a light-weight predominator-based algorithm to detect violations of RFC rules. We implemented a prototype of RIBDetector and demonstrated its efficacy by applying it on 14 implementations of 5 network protocols.

Homomorphic encryption ensures the biometric payload is always one-way encrypted with no need for key management and provides full privacy by ensuring plaintext biometrics are never received by the SBP server. The SBP implementation includes software running on a client device and on the SPB server. Pluggable components are used to replace legacy functionality to allow rapid integration into existing operating environments. The SBP implementation allows the systems to meet security needs by using the application programming interface, whether the underlying system is a relational database management system or a search engine. The SBP implementation functionality offers a “point-and-cut” mechanism to add the appropriate security to the production systems as well as to the systems in development.

Most padding mechanisms that were previously proposed statically select the number of bytes inserted in the packets, which incurs high overhead and ineffective privacy improvement. These static mechanisms are particularly unsuitable for networks whose traffic patterns are significantly dynamic, such as smart homes. This article proposes an adaptive packet padding approach based on software-defined networking (SDN) that adjusts the number of bytes inserted into packets in response to variations in the home network utilization. The proposed technique monitors the network to instruct a padding mechanism through a representational state transfer (REST) interface proposed in this article. This mechanism ensures that the length of packets generated by connected devices is modified. The evaluation includes four supervised learning mechanisms, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and k-nearest neighbors (KNNs), to measure privacy improvement through the metrics accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Goodput, jitter, and packet loss induced by the proposal are also evaluated. Our proposal is shown to overcome the state-of-the-art solutions in privacy preservation with a significantly lower overhead. For instance, the accuracy of RF on identifying devices decreases from 96% to 4.96%.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3025988","Fundação de Amparo a Ciência e Tecnologia de Pernambuco;; Fundação Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico;; Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9203848","Home networks;Internet of Things (IoT);packet padding;software-defined networking (SDN)","Privacy;Proposals;Internet of Things;Smart homes;Performance evaluation;Adaptive systems","computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic","traffic obfuscation;privacy threats;commonly used techniques;machine learning techniques;packet size;encrypted traffic;homes introduces numerous threats;smart home networks;privacy preservation;packet loss;decision tree;supervised learning mechanisms;connected devices;padding mechanism;home network utilization;software-defined networking;adaptive packet padding approach;smart homes;static mechanisms;ineffective privacy improvement","","10","","21","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A normally operating high-voltage transmission network could approximately satisfy the linearization conditions so the ISFs remain constant. The existing ISFs calculation method is the DC approximations based on the branch reactance matrix. But this method has inherent drawbacks resulting in its inaccuracy in two aspects: (1) the parameters of power system elements are hard to acquire accurately because of parameter offset as operation states change; (2) we need to set a reference node to balance the power flow, but the setting is often inconsistent with the real balance strategy. In the above context, we propose a measurement-based estimation method which uses robust least-squares estimation and SCADA measurement data to calculate the ISFs. The effectiveness of the method is verified by comparing the ISFs got from the measurement-based robust estimation with the ones got from DC approximations and the ordinary least-squares estimation (LSE).","","978-1-4799-5032-4","10.1109/POWERCON.2014.6993679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993679","Injection shift factors;Least-squares estimation;Robust least-squares estimation;SCADA measurement data","Estimation;Transmission line measurements;Transmission line matrix methods;Load flow;Approximation methods;Robustness","estimation theory;least squares approximations;load flow;power generation scheduling;power system management;power system measurement;power system security;transmission networks","measurement-based estimation method;injection shift factors;ISF calculation method;real-time scheduling;security check;congestion management;high-voltage transmission network;linearization conditions;branch reactance matrix;power system elements;power flow;least-squares estimation;SCADA measurement data","","","","16","IEEE","22 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different mitigation techniques have been proposed in the literature that aims to mitigate these attacks by randomizing the address to cache location mappings. The security guarantees in these schemes are based on the degree of difficulty for an attacker to reliably determine the cache lines accessed by the victim within practical time settings. However, prior attacks have shown that newer and more improved algorithms can be envisaged that discover conflicting sets in the secured randomized caches. In this work, we first categorize different types of cache designs into four broad classes based on the extent of non-determinism and randomness of allocating an address in those caches. We then develop a mathematical framework to formally analyse the security implications of the randomized and partitioned cache designs in terms of collision probability, self-collision probability and size of the eviction set required to perform a successful eviction-based attack. We further empirically demonstrate set associative eviction on recently proposed randomization schemes called Mirage and Scattercache. Next, we propose two algorithms to generate efficient eviction set on these schemes and analytically evaluate the efficacy of our algorithms against the one proposed in the literature. Finally, we argue that mere randomization using a cryptographic primitive as used in popular schemes like Scattercache, CEASER-S, Mirage etc. does not provide the required randomness. Although the randomized-partitioned caches provide some resilience against eviction-set generation techniques, they are still vulnerable to eviction-based attacks.","2378-203X","978-1-6654-7652-2","10.1109/HPCA56546.2023.10071041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071041","","Microarchitecture;Cache memory;Side-channel attacks;Computer architecture;Signal generators;Partitioning algorithms;Reliability","cache storage;cryptography;probability","cache based side-channel attacks;cache lines;cache location mappings;CEASER-S;conflicting sets;cryptographic primitive;eviction-based attacks;eviction-set generation techniques;mathematical framework;mere randomization;microarchitectural state changes;Mirage;mitigation techniques;partitioned cache designs;randomized cache designs;randomized-partitioned caches;Scattercache;self-collision probability;shared cache memory","","","","34","IEEE","24 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, the UWA channel is under impersonation attack by a malicious node (Eve) present in the close vicinity of the legitimate node pair (Alice and Bob); Eve tries to inject its malicious data into the system by making Bob believe that she is indeed Alice. To thwart the impersonation attack by Eve, Bob utilizes the distance of the transmit node as the feature/fingerprint to carry out feature-based authentication at the physical layer. Due to authentication at Bob, due to lack of channel knowledge at the transmit node (Alice or Eve), and due to the threshold-based decoding error model, the relevant dynamics of the considered system could be modelled by a Markov chain (MC). Thus, we compute the state-transition probabilities of the MC, and the moment generating function for the service process corresponding to each state. This enables us to derive a closed-form expression of the EC in terms of authentication parameters. Furthermore, we compute the optimal transmission rate (at Alice) through gradient-descent (GD) technique and artificial neural network (ANN) method. Simulation results show that the EC decreases under severe authentication constraints (i.e., more false alarms and more transmissions by Eve). Simulation results also reveal that the (optimal transmission rate) performance of the ANN technique is quite close to that of the GTJ method.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-5089-5","10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9149395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149395","Effective capacity;authentication;underwater acoustic;quality-of-service;artificial neural networks","Kuiper belt","channel coding;gradient methods;Markov processes;neural nets;probability;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;underwater acoustic communication;wireless channels","malicious data;impersonation attack;feature-based authentication;state-transition probabilities;underwater acoustic channel;UWA channel;malicious node;authentication constraints;threshold-based decoding error model;Markov chain;gradient-descent technique;artificial neural network;GTJ method","","7","","29","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Virtual machines are becoming increasing popular for deploying servers because they allow checkpointing and live migration facilities. The challenges are dealing with non-virtual state elements, like ongoing network communications that can't be check-pointed, and recovering state changed between failure and the last check-point. Other complications include dependence on human intervention and precise timing so as not to revert to an un-healthy VM already in the state of compromise. This paper describes a Xen based middleware that pervasively detects terminated VM servers and reincarnates them in a safe state such that they don't lose connectivity to their network clients. It also attempts to isolate messages that caused the failure and generates rules to disallow them from effecting the newly reincarnated VM in the future. Since it essentially allows a VM to start a new life from a point in time before it got compromised, we dubbed it: a time-forking virtual machine (TFVM) following the Copenhagen school's ""many worlds theory"" that postulates that every historical event forks a new universe for every possible outcome. Currently TFVM works in the context of our particular application but we discuss how to extend our model to allow reincarnation of generalized services","","0-7695-2788-4","10.1109/PERCOMW.2007.103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4144882","","Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server;Network servers;Mission critical systems;Telecommunications;Internet;Checkpointing;Humans;Timing","Internet telephony;middleware;telecommunication security;virtual machines","reincarnation security;Xen based time-forking virtual machines;mission-critical telecom servers;Internet;VoIP;nonvirtual state elements;human intervention;Xen based middleware;many worlds theory","","","1","10","IEEE","2 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sequential logic locking, watermark insertion, fault-injection assessment of a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) control flow, information leakage assessment, and reverse engineering at gate-level abstraction, to name a few, require precise FSM extraction from the synthesized netlist of the design. Unfortunately, no reliable solutions are currently available for fast and accurate extraction of FSMs from the highly unstructured gate-level netlist for effective security evaluation. The major challenge in developing such a solution is precise recognition of FSM state flip-flops in a netlist having a massive collection of flip-flops. In this paper, we propose FSMx-Ultra, a framework for extracting FSMs from extremely unstructured gate-level netlists. FSMx-Ultra utilizes state-of-the-art graph theory concepts and algorithms to distinguish FSM state registers from other registers and then constructs gate-level state transition graphs (STGs) for each identified FSM state register using automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) techniques. The results of our experiments on 14 open-source benchmark designs illustrate that FSMx-Ultra can recover all FSMs quickly and precisely from synthesized gate-level netlists of diverse complexity and size utilizing various state encoding schemes.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2023.3266368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10098877","FSM Automata Theory;FSM Extraction;Netlist Analysis;Security Assessment","Logic gates;Registers;Security;Encoding;Automata;Data mining;Flip-flops","","","","","","","IEEE","11 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We newly defined two types of silent cyber risk, namely, Alteration risk and Combination risk, and conducted risk assessment. Our assessment identified 23 risk factors, and after analyzing them, we found that all of them were classified as Risk Transference.

A large number of applications relate to cellular and mobile telephony, pagers, local area networks, cordless phones, global positioning systems, and security systems. Pseudo-SAW (PSAW) and more recently the High Velocity Pseudo-SAW (HVPSAW) have received a great deal of attention due to their high phase velocities, and therefore the high frequencies of operation these modes may provide. In addition to high phase velocities, the pseudo-modes must also present low propagation losses and considerably high electromechanical coupling coefficients to be considered for practical devices. This paper verifies that the metallic layer thickness is a relevant SAW device parameter in order to achieve lower losses, for high frequency, high electromechanical coupling, low loss SAW devices. Popular PSAW and HVPSAW material orientations such as 64/spl deg/ YX LiNbO/sub 3/(0/spl deg/ 26/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), 36/spl deg/ YX LiTaO/sub 3/ (0/spl deg/-54/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), LiNbO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 36/spl deg/), LiTaO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 31/spl deg/), quartz ST-X (0/spl deg/ 132.75/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), Li/sub 2/B/sub 4/O/sub 7/ (0/spl deg/ 45/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/), among others, are considered. In addition to the lower losses and the dispersion analysis for the pseudo modes, the present work discusses the transitions with layer thickness from HVPSAWs to higher order PSAWs modes, and the transitions from PSAWs to the generalized SAWs (GSAWs) modes. Besides contributing to the knowledge of the pseudo-modes behavior with layer thickness, this mode transition analysis enlightens the situation where the losses in the pseudo modes go to zero, due to the merging of the pseudo modes into the GSAWs. The fact that as a function of thickness the GSAWs are a natural continuation for the pseudo modes may be conveniently used in the fabrication of low loss devices. For completeness the effects of heavy layer metals, such as gold, in reducing the layer thickness where the pseudo modes merge to the GSAWs are discussed. Numerical results are compared to some experimental data available in the literature, and the present analysis elucidates experimentally observed higher order pseudo modes, and values of layer thickness where lower losses are achieved.","1051-0117","0-7803-4153-8","10.1109/ULTSYM.1997.663018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=663018","","Surface acoustic wave devices;Frequency;Performance loss;Cellular networks;Telephony;Local area networks;Propagation losses;Merging;Fabrication;Gold","surface acoustic wave devices;surface acoustic wave devices;surface acoustic wave devices;surface acoustic wave devices;electromechanical effects;electromechanical effects;electromechanical effects;electromechanical effects;lithium compounds;lithium compounds;lithium compounds;quartz","layer thickness;GSAW devices;PSAW devices;HVPSAW devices;SAW device design;low loss;high performance;high frequency operation;pseudo-SAW device;high velocity pseudo-SAW device;high phase velocities;low propagation losses;high electromechanical coupling coefficients;metallic layer thickness;SAW device parameter;LiNbO/sub 3/;LiTaO/sub 3/;quartz;Li/sub 2/B/sub 4/O/sub 7/;dispersion analysis;mode transition analysis;low loss devices;gold;SiO/sub 2/;Au","","5","","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The motivating factors are device and user mobility, i.e., to let the user determine where application components should execute at all times. In order to organize and locate roaming devices, a decentralized peer-to-peer overlay is developed. To provide location transparency for application developers and enable efficient data sharing among application components, an API is provided that hides whether shared memory or latency optimized network distribution is used to share data. The problem of open TCP connections to third-party applications is solved with a proxy-based approach. Multimedia applications are especially sensitive to service interruptions that can be caused by migration, and a new approach for check-pointing, state transfer, and resuming an application with minimal freeze time is therefore introduced.

There exist a manifold of different reasons for system failures of devices starting from short-circuits, hardware defects or malware infections reaching to power shortages or complete blackouts. Moreover, the increase of the number of devices within the airport infrastructure system leads to a tremendous demand of computational assistance systems for operations management. As most devices within the airport are directly connected to processes, there is a high demand for identifying and managing system failures immediately and increase the system resilience. Thus, we introduce process-oriented-grouping of network devices and use linear algebra to relate the impact of system state changes to airport processes, such as check-in, security checks et cetera. This connection between system state and processes is inevitable for a successful combination of computational approaches to determine physical state variations, induced by power grid instabilities and/or cyber-attacks, and process oriented simulation methods. Matrix relations between system states, process capacities, waiting times are given and applied to a small, at this state fictional airport infrastructure. This application shows that forecasting of quantitative values for airport processes is a beneficial tool for airport infrastructure management. Moreover, linear algebra properties prove to be a strong tool in analyzing network properties, such as infrastructure diversity and process capacities, which play a major role within resource management. However, at the moment our approach is only suitable as a supporting tool for human decision making. Nevertheless the approach can be enhanced as intelligent health monitoring system for airports.","2155-4951","978-1-7281-1893-2","10.1109/ICNSURV.2019.8735110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735110","","Airports;Security;Process control;Linear algebra;Standards;Tools;Resource management","airports;invasive software;linear algebra;power grids","process-oriented-grouping;resource management;airport operation;short-circuits;hardware defects;malware infections;power shortages;airport infrastructure system;computational assistance systems;power grid instabilities;airport infrastructure management;linear algebra properties;intelligent health monitoring system;operation management","","1","","12","IEEE","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, current methods for detecting attacks are not sufficiently accurate and no methods can provide attack mitigation. To ensure vehicle ABS security, we propose an attack detection method to accurately detect both sensor attack and CAN bus attack in a vehicle ABS, and an attack mitigation strategy to mitigate their negative effects on the vehicle ABS. In our attack detection method, we build a vehicle state space equation which considers real-time road friction coefficient to predict vehicle states (i.e., wheel speed and longitudinal brake force) with their previous values. Based on sets of historical measured vehicle states, we develop a search algorithm to find out attack changes (vehicle state changes because of the attack) by minimizing errors between predicted vehicle states and measured vehicle states. In our attack mitigation strategy, attack changes are subtracted from measured vehicle states to generate correct vehicle states for the vehicle ABS. We conducted first real sensor attack experiments to show how a magnet affects sensor readings. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack detection method can detect sensor attack and CAN bus attack more accurately compared with existing methods, and also our attack mitigation strategy almost eliminates attack's effects on the vehicle ABS.","2637-9430","978-1-7281-6607-0","10.1109/ICCCN49398.2020.9209645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9209645","CAN bus attack;Sensor attack;Attack detection and mitigation;Vehicle ABS","Brakes;Force;Wheels;Hydraulic systems;Real-time systems;Roads;Friction","brakes;braking;controller area networks;field buses;search problems;sensors","vehicle state prediction;attack mitigation strategy;sensor attack experiments;attack detection method;CAN bus attacks;controller area network bus;vehicle ABS security;vehicle state space equation;vehicle antilock braking systems;driving direction control;real-time road friction coefficient;search algorithm","","2","","24","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally it is used in households as an over current circuit breaker to ensure safety from electrical hazards like outrageous fire accidents arising from electrical short circuit. These kinds of electrical hazards occur because the amperage of these circuit breakers are fixed and we cannot change the tripping current anytime to endure the newly added or removed electrical loads. This paper reports the experimental realization of a numerical overcurrent relay using, primarily, a microcontroller and a micro current transformer (CT) which is compatible with smart grid technology and high voltage system like electric vehicle. In this newly designed numerical over current relay (NOCR) the user can change the set current and the sensitivity of the system just by twisting two different knobs. Thus this system ensures advance security against electrical hazards than a normal MCB. It will obtain, trial and covert analog current signals hooked on digital form of a power system in real time. Solid state switch (MOSFET switch) has been opted as circuit breaker in order to enhance system effectivity. This newly designed system can detect a fault or over current with 100% accuracy and the operating time (OT) calculated by this relay is 99.57% responsive to the theoretical calculation.

Moreover, to improve the accuracy of voltage stability assessment (VSA), the influence on LIMM of voltage characteristics of static ZIP load is considered while calculating LIMM. Based on the above, an improved optimization model of VSC-OPF is established, which greatly reduces the time for updating VSC-OPF results to improve its ability to adapt to mode changes of the power system. The proposed approach is tested in the IEEE 30-bus standard system and the real-world 220kV network in Hunan province in China.

The only proper way to protect a smart contract is to fix potential risks in its code before it is deployed to the blockchain. However, existing tools for smart contract security analysis focus on the detection of bugs but seldom consider the code fix issues. Meanwhile, it is often time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to understand and fix flawed code manually. In this paper we propose SMARTSHIELD, a bytecode rectification system, to fix three typical security-related bugs (i.e., state changes after external calls, missing checks for out-of-bound arithmetic operations, and missing checks for failing external calls) in smart contracts automatically and help developers release secure contracts. Moreover, SMARTSHIELD guarantees that the rectified contract is not only immune to certain attacks but also gas-friendly (i.e., a slightly increase of gas cost). To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of SMARTSHIELD, we applied it to 28,621 real-world buggy contracts on Ethereum blockchain (as of January 2nd2019). Experiment results demonstrated that among 95,502 insecure cases in those contracts, 87,346 (91.5%) of them were automatically fixed by SMARTSHIELD. A following test with both program analysis and real-world exploits further testified that the rectified contracts were secure against common attacks. Moreover, the rectification only introduced a 0.2 % gas increment for each contract on average.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-5143-4","10.1109/SANER48275.2020.9054825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9054825","Ethereum blockchain;Smart contract;Automated bug fix;Bytecode rectification","Codes;Costs;Smart contracts;Computer bugs;Semantics;Transforms;Software","contracts;cryptography;distributed databases;program debugging","security response mechanisms;smart contract security analysis;Ethereum blockchain;real-world buggy contracts;rectified contract;secure contracts;security-related bugs;bytecode rectification system;flawed code;code fix issues;code patching;automatic smart contract protection;SMARTSHIELD","","25","","68","IEEE","2 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Once a network component is infected by viruses, worms, or became a target of network attacks, its operational state shifts from normal to abnormal state. Online monitoring mechanism can collect important aspects of network traffic and host data (CPU utilization, memory usage, etc.), that can be effectively used to detect abnormal behaviors caused by attacks.

Although regular expressions offer superior expressive ability and flexibility, application protocols are described by regular expression manually based on sufficiently understanding protocol itself. At present there is not an effect method to realize classification, recognition and control automatically for the known applications and the unknown applications in future. In this paper a novel approach is presented to model network application specification. In this work, the whole automatic protocol reverse engineering is realized through accomplishing the protocol state machine, and then the FSMs are translated to corresponding regular expressions to enrich and update the pattern database. This approach uses grammatical inference and is motivated by the observation that an implementation of the protocol is inherently a state transition process, the state machine model the essence exactly. The important significance is to describe various state protocols with a common method through modeling the protocol state transition, including known and unknown ones.

Conventional anomaly detection methods usually find low-probability events with a learned a probability distribution model, or evaluate the testing samples with the local density of the testing samples. Multi-state system usually has multiple normal states, and state changes at unpredictable points caused by the daily operation such as feed, outlet, flow control, etc. For the multistate system, collecting enough data that contain all possible states are challenging or impossible to users. Furthermore, conventional anomaly detection methods are sensitive to the context of training datasets or the unpredicted phased changes of the testing datasets, or just consider the local density of the testing samples. Motivated by this problem, we transform the model learning problem to a distinction learning problem that learns the familiarity of each testing samples. In order to reduce the effects of the phased changes, we randomly shuffle the testing dataset and use a sliding window to evaluate the familiarity of the testing samples with one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. Our contributions include: (1) reducing the requirement of the prior knowledge; (2) handling the phased changes of the testing datasets, (3) considering the global familiarity of the testing samples.

The state transitions are managed by added signals that may come from various triggers depending on the target application. We devise an algorithm for implementing the N-variant IC design. We discuss the necessary manipulations of the added signals that would facilitate the various tasks. The key advantage to integrating the heterogeneity in the functional specification of the design is that we can configure the variants during or post-manufacturing, but removal, extraction or deletion of the variants is not viable. Experimental results on benchmark circuits demonstrate that the method can be automatically and efficiently implemented. Because of its lightweight, N-variant design is particularly well-suited for securing embedded systems.

Asymmetric information games are particularly relevant for security problems, e.g., where an attacker knows its own skill set or alternatively a system administrator knows the state of its resources. In such settings, the informed player is faced with the tradeoff of exploiting its superior information at the cost of revealing its superior information. This tradeoff is typically addressed through randomization, in an effort to keep the uninformed player informationally off balance. A lingering issue is the explicit computation of such strategies. This paper, building on prior work for repeated games, presents an LP formulation to compute suboptimal strategies for the informed player in discounted asymmetric information stochastic games in which state transitions are not affected by the uninformed player. Furthermore, the paper presents bounds between the security level guaranteed by the sub-optimal strategy and the optimal value.

In recent years, blockchain technology has been introduced as a panacea to our security problems, including that of authentication, without sufficient reasoning, as to its merits.In this work, we investigate the merits of using open distributed ledgers (ODLs), such as the one implemented by blockchain technology, for securing TM systems for authentication. We formally model such systems, and explore how blockchain can help mitigate attacks against them. After formal argumentation, we conclude that in the context of Trust Management for authentication, blockchain technology, and ODLs in general, can offer considerable advantages compared to previous approaches. Our analysis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to formally model and argue about the security of TM systems for authentication, based on blockchain technology. To achieve this result, we first provide an abstract model for TM systems for authentication. Then, we show how this model can be conceptually encoded in a blockchain, by expressing it as a series of state transitions. As a next step, we examine five prevalent attacks on TM systems, and provide evidence that blockchain-based solutions can be beneficial to the security of such systems, by mitigating, or completely negating such attacks.","2324-9013","978-1-5090-4906-6","10.1109/Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS.2017.283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029486","Trust Management for authentication;blockchain technology;formal modeling;attacks and defences","Authentication;Public key;Electronic mail;Bitcoin;Organizations","interactive systems;trusted computing;ubiquitous computing","trust management;authentication;TM systems;online interactions security;ubiquitous system;Web of Trust;blockchain technology;open distributed ledgers;ODL","","43","1","50","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To increase attacks' success chance and resilience against defence mechanisms, modern botnets have often a decentralized P2P structure. Here, IoT devices are playing a critical role, becoming one of the major tools for malicious parties to perform attacks. Notable examples are DDoS attacks on Krebs on Security and DYN, which have been performed by IoT devices part of botnets. We take a first step towards detecting P2P botnets in IoT, by proposing AutoBotCatcher, whose design is driven by the consideration that bots of the same botnet frequently communicate with each other and form communities. As such, the purpose of AutoBotCatcher is to dynamically analyze communities of IoT devices, formed according to their network traffic flows, to detect botnets. AutoBotCatcher exploits a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain, as a state transition machine that allows collaboration of multiple parties without trust, in order to perform collaborative and dynamic botnet detection by collecting and auditing IoT devices' network traffic flows as blockchain transactions. In this paper, we focus on the design of the AutoBotCatcher by first defining the blockchain structure underlying AutoBot-Catcher, then discussing its components.","","978-1-5386-9502-9","10.1109/CIC.2018.00-46","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8537811","Blockchain;Internet of Things;Security;P2P botnets;Botnet detection","Botnet;Generators;Internet of Things;Collaboration;Performance evaluation;Computer crime","computer network security;Internet;Internet of Things;invasive software;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication traffic","Byzantine fault tolerant blockchain;dynamic botnet detection;collaborative botnet detection;IoT devices part;DDoS attacks;malicious parties;decentralized P2P structure;malicious purposes;compromised internet computers;Blockchain-Based P2P;AutoBotCatcher","","28","","28","IEEE","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multiple-stride deterministic finite automaton (DFA) increases the performance of pattern matching, because they allow multiple bytes of a packet to be scanned simultaneously. However, traditional multiple-stride DFA either rely on specific hardware for parallel comparison or have a huge memory requirements due to state explosion. In this paper, we present a high throughput, multiple-stride pattern-matching architecture that requires a small storage cost and no specific hardware. The basic idea is to group DFA states/transitions into three coarse-grained and variable-size blocks, so that each individual block can employ different-specific methods to optimize storage requirements and performance. The blocks are naturally identified based on basic observations of DFA characteristics: prefix, linear trie and state dependencies. The performance evaluation is done using the Snort pattern sets. We show that multi-byte striding DFA achieves multi Gb/s pure content inspection in software, while utilizing <3 bytes per pattern character.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxq077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8130271","pattern matching;memory and performance optimization;deep packet inspection;network security","","","","","5","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Accordingly, a myriad of dynamic mitigation devices have been proposed in the last few decades where these devices are installed at strategic points in the grid. Transformer-less power electronics-based modules, integrated between the neutral and substation ground of traditional transformers, have been proposed introducing a variety of advanced grid mitigation and support features; DC elimination, voltage regulation, voltage and impedance balancing, harmonics isolation and power flow control. However, the protection of these series-connected modules against high voltage development during ground faults or inrush currents is critical as it could damage these converter-based mitigation devices or exceed the transformer BIL rating, thus, severely threatening the energy security.

EPS was designed assuming high speed real-time bulk multimedia data transfer; so initial cost of bearer setup signaling for user plane data is justified. However, this basic assumption is changed due to very small and infrequent background data transfer by the smartphone's always-on applications most of the time when smartphone is not in active use. To transmit this background data, UE incurs frequent idle to connected state transitions and require costly disproportionate signaling overhead for EPS bearer and Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection setup/release procedure. This paper presents a connectionless transmission (CLT) scheme for efficient exchange of background data without establishing the EPS bearer and RRC connection. In the proposed CLT scheme, the data packets are made self-sustainable by carrying routing information in the packet's header. These self-sustained packets are carried through modified Random Access Channel (RACH) procedure between the UE and the eNodeB. Further, another novel aspect of the CLT scheme is to establish common user plane bearers between the radio access network and packet gateways in the core network, to forward self-sustain data packets using the routing information. Our simulation results show CLT scheme reduces the signaling overhead significantly compared to the traditional connection oriented transmission.","1938-1883","978-1-4799-2003-7","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883692","","Security;Context;Mobile communication;Data transfer;Wireless communication;IP networks","IP networks;multimedia communication;radio equipment;radio networks;telecommunication signalling;wireless channels","efficient data transmission method;evolved packet system;EPS;flat-IP architecture;connection oriented system;logical bearers;user equipment;UE;core network;real-time bulk multimedia data transfer;setup signaling;infrequent background data transfer;radio resource control;connectionless transmission;CLT;random access channel;RACH procedure;eNodeB;packet gateways;radio access network;plane bearers;connection oriented transmission","","","4","11","IEEE","28 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prior works require multiple access points (AP) deployed in the tracking region or to utilize elaborately selected multipaths in an indoor environment to achieve tracking. However, this prevents their wide adoption because scenarios like homes typically only have a single AP, and using multipaths is vulnerable to unexpected interferences due to the complex indoor environment. This paper proposes a tracking system using only a single AP. The insight behind the proposed system is to mine the multi-dimensional channel parameters from the direct path to realize tracking. Therefore, we develop a model that establishes the correlation between the target motion and channel parameters, including the direct path's angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD). Then, we can formulate the tracking problem as the state transition with the observations. Since the nonlinear observation equation, we use particle filters to solve the problem accurately. Finally, we validate the proposed system via simulation using ray-tracing software. The simulation results show that the median tracking error is 0.21 m based on a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), comparable to previous state-of-the-art systems.","2166-9589","978-1-6654-8053-6","10.1109/PIMRC54779.2022.9977459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9977459","Indoor tracking;single access point;wireless channel model;direct path;particle filter","Wireless communication;Target tracking;Simulation;Ray tracing;Mathematical models;Software;Indoor environment","direction-of-arrival estimation;image motion analysis;indoor radio;Kalman filters;multipath channels;particle filtering (numerical methods);radiowave propagation;ray tracing;target tracking;tracking;wireless LAN","complex indoor environment;decimeter level indoor tracking;direct path;elaborately selected multipaths;elderly care;median tracking error;multidimensional channel parameters;multiple access points;noise figure 20.0 dB;nonlinear observation equation;previous state-of-the-art systems;security monitoring;single access point;single AP;size 0.21 m;target motion;tracking problem;tracking region;tracking system;unexpected interferences","","","","10","IEEE","20 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

That is, they protect Trusted Applications (TAs) even if the Operating System or the hypervisor are compromised. The TEE runs in parallel with the OS and leverages a set of hardware and software components to create such an isolated environment. However, this isolation can be broken by exploiting microarchitectural side-channels. The state of the shared components of multi-core processors depends on the actual processes being executed, and as a result, some information is leaked from one process to any other running in the same processor. This leakage completely breaks the confidentiality guarantees that TEEs promise. The only way to completely avoid the leakage is to avoid the share of resources, but this is nearly impossible to achieve without a huge degradation in the performance of the processor. Assuming that it is possible that the leakage exists, and the attacker only can get information from the observable microarchitectural state, we propose to monitor the hardware resources to detect the microarchitectural state changes caused by the attacks. To this end, we have implemented a hardware module that compares at runtime pre-stored microarchitectural execution signatures of each enclave, with the actual execution trace, and triggers an alarm when it detects significant variation.","2640-5563","978-1-7281-9132-4","10.1109/DCIS51330.2020.9268660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268660","Microarchitectural attacks;CUSUM;DTW;TEE;Performance Counters","Hardware;Microarchitecture;Program processors;Security;Monitoring;Registers;VHDL","data protection;digital signatures;operating systems (computers);program diagnostics;resource allocation;trusted computing","microarchitectural isolation guarantees;confidentiality;trusted applications;operating system;microarchitectural side channels;multicore processors;execution trace;trusted execution environments;microarchitectural execution signatures;hypervisor;parallel TEE;information leakage","","","","35","IEEE","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The verification problem in grsecurity presents much of the complexity of modern RBAC systems, due to the presence of policy state changes that may arise both from explicit administrative primitives supported by grsecurity, and as the result of the interaction with the underlying operating system facilities. We develop a formal semantics for grsecurity's RBAC system, based on a labelled transition system, and a sound abstraction of that semantics providing a bounded approximation, amenable to model checking.

Their flexibility, however, increases the complexity of the detection system and often limits the detection speed as well as the total number of RegExes that can be detected using limited resources. The two classical detection methods, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), have the potential problems of prohibitively large memory requirements and a large number of concurrent operations, respectively. Although recent schemes addressing these problems to improve DFA and NFA are promising, they are inherently limited by their scalability, since they follow the state transition model in DFA and NFA, where the state transitions occur per each character of the input. We recently proposed a scalable RegEx detection system called Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to solve these problems with three novel ideas: 1. Provide specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilizations. 2. Systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce number of concurrent operations. 3. Sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient hardware architecture and prototype design implementation based on LaFA. Our proof-of-concept prototype design is built on a fraction of a single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip and can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Using only 7% of the logic area and 25% of the memory on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100, the prototype design can achieve 2-Gbps (gigabits-per-second) detection throughput with only one detection engine. We estimate that 34-Gbps detection throughput can be achieved if the entire resources of a state-of-the-art FPGA chip are used to implement multiple detection engines.","","978-1-4244-6534-7","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470750","","Hardware;Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Prototypes;Field programmable gate arrays;Throughput;Engines;Scalability;Resource management;Programmable logic arrays","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;optimisation;security of data","hardware implementation;scalable lookahead regular expression detection;RegExes;detection system complexity;deterministic finite automaton;DFA;nondeterministic finite automaton;NFA;prototype design implementation;field programmable gate array;FPGA","","3","","28","IEEE","24 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, they are resource-constrained and connected via lossy links. This paper addresses the optimized scheduling of the monitoring role between the embedded devices in IoT networks. The objective is to minimize energy consumption and communication overhead of monitoring, for each node. Several subsets of the potential monitoring nodes are generated by solving a minimal vertex cover (VC) problem with constraint generation. Assuming periodical functioning, VCs are optimally assigned to time periods in order to distribute the monitoring role throughout the entire network. The assignment of VCs to periods is modeled as a multiobjective generalized assignment problem. To further optimize the energy consumption of the monitors, they are sequenced across time periods to minimize the state transitions of nodes. This part of the problem is modeled as a traveling salesman path problem. The proposed model is tested on randomly generated instances and the experimental results illustrate its effectiveness to optimize the scheduled monitoring for fault tolerance in IoT networks.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2792326","Academy of Scientific Research and Technology; French Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Granting the Imhotep Project MONIOT(grant numbers:33124VJ); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254334","Energy-efficient monitoring;generalized assignment problem (GAP);Internet of Things (IoT);robustness;scheduling;traveling salesman path (TSP) problem;vertex cover (VC)","Monitoring;Wireless sensor networks;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Routing;Energy consumption;Internet of Things","computer network security;fault tolerance;Internet;Internet of Things;optimisation;scheduling;travelling salesman problems","traveling salesman path problem;scheduled monitoring;IoT networks;energy-efficient multiobjective scheduling model;wireless networks;critical applications;security risks;lossy links;optimized scheduling;energy consumption;potential monitoring nodes;minimal vertex cover problem;constraint generation;multiobjective generalized assignment problem;VC problem","","20","","48","IEEE","11 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A previously developed Markov-chain based model is refined into an interdependent Markov chain model to capture the role of cyber threat from the communication network and the human-operator error during cascading failures. The state transitions of the Markov chain are parameterized by the critical operating parameters of the power grid. The calculations assume a generic form of correlation between the level of and damage from cyber-attacks, on the one hand, and the level of interdependence on the other hand. The model finds the optimal level of interdependence, i.e., the trade-off between well-informed control and vulnerability to attacks that minimizes the probability of massive cascading failures in power grids.

On the other hand, side-channel analysis has emerged as an effective approach for detection of such large sequential Trojans. However, existing side-channel approaches suffer from large reduction in detection sensitivity with increasing process variations or decreasing Trojan size. In this paper, we propose TeSR, a Temporal Self-Referencing approach that compares the current signature of a chip at two different time windows to completely eliminate the effect of process noise, thus providing high detection sensitivity for Trojans of varying size. Furthermore, unlike existing approaches, it does not require golden chip instances as a reference.

In particular, concealment mechanisms must modify well-known data structures, which could be detected trivially otherwise. We argue that any such mechanism is necessarily non-atomic and can hence be detected through concurrent observations forcing an interleaved linearization of the malicious code with observations of memory state changes induced in tightly coupled concurrent processing units. Extending previous research for the case of symmetric concurrent observation, we propose a computational model and observation mechanism for the case of tightly coupled asymmetric concurrent processing units as may be found in most current computing environments with particular emphasis on metrics for the cost of forced synchronization and resource contention caused by observations. We argue that the resulting observations will provide a novel sensor datum for intrusion detection but may also be used as a standalone probabilistic detection mechanism particularly suited to detect attacks in progress.","","978-1-4244-6232-2","10.1109/ICONS.2010.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5464146","Intrusion Detection;Computational Model;Asymmetric Concurrency;Memory Observation","Costs;Concurrent computing;Kernel;Interference;Computational modeling;Monitoring;Computer architecture;Information security;Data structures;Intrusion detection","concurrency control;data structures;invasive software","observation mechanism;cost model;tightly coupled asymmetric concurrency;malicious code;second-order operation;privilege escalation;concealment mechanism;data structures;concurrent observations;interleaved linearization;concurrent processing units;computational model;forced synchronization;resource contention","","3","","19","IEEE","13 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast, the depth of the proposed multicast key backbone is fixed.

Recently, radio frequency (RF) fingerprint-based identification schemes have attracted wide attention as they extract the inherent characteristics of hardware circuits which is very hard to forge. However, existing RF fingerprint-based approaches face the problems of unstable region of interest (ROI), high-cost feature design, and incomplete automation. To address these problems, this paper proposes a multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract RF fingerprint from the selected ROI for classifying ZigBee devices. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptive ROI selection algorithm is also developed to alleviate the effect of semi-steady behavior of ZigBee devices owing to sleep mode switching. The proposed MSCNN uses multiple downsampling transformations for multiscale feature extraction and classification automatically. To validate and evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we design a testbed consisting of one low-cost universal software radio peripheral (USRP) as the receiver and 54 CC2530 devices as targets for identification. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MSCNN both in the line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. The classification accuracy is as high as 97% under the LOS scenarios around SNR = 30 dB. Our scheme is robust over a wide range of SNRs under the LOS scenarios as well as under the NLOS scenarios.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2911347","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571110,61602113,61601114); National Natural Science Youth Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801115); Purple Mountain Laboratories (PML); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692418","Multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN);radio frequency (RF) fingerprint;region of interest (ROI) selection;semi-steady portion;ZigBee","Feature extraction;Radio frequency;Zigbee;Internet of Things;Signal to noise ratio;Performance evaluation;Receivers","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;Internet of Things;signal classification;software radio;Zigbee","multiscale feature extraction;low-cost universal software radio peripheral;MSCNN;LOS scenarios;robust RF fingerprinting approach;multisampling convolutional neural network;device identification;radio frequency fingerprint-based identification schemes;hardware circuits;high-cost feature design;ZigBee devices;ROI selection algorithm;semisteady behavior;unstable region of interest;RF fingerprint-based approaches;signal-to-noise ratio adaptive ROI selection algorithm;downsampling transformations","","84","","58","IEEE","16 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More importantly, this type of frauds can also affect the successors of the 3G and their related paradigms such as smart cities. In this paper, we deeply examine the considerable signaling load of the IDLE-DCH state transitions that can be exploited by malicious entities to launch signaling DoS attacks. Besides, we investigate some state-of-art techniques proposed to combat the signaling attacks. A comparative analysis between these solutions has been conducted with regard to three pertinent criteria: cost, efficiency and overhead. The summary of results indicates that even though the randomization experiences some flaws related to the radio channel consumption, it presents the most optimal cost and overhead compared to the remaining solutions.

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing. Secondly, over 65% reduction in the number of transitions has been achieved using ACT for stride-2 DFA implementation.","","978-1-4799-7981-3","10.1109/CSE.2014.125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023635","DFA;regular expressions;deep packet inspection;alphabet compression;multi-byte matching","Pattern matching;Indexes;Inspection;Educational institutions;Memory management;Automata;Parallel processing","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;security of data","multibyte pattern matching;high speed deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;deterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;processing complexity;stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching;stride-k DFA compression technique;alphabet compression table;ACT;stride-2 SPPM","","3","","24","IEEE","29 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While many intrusion detection systems (IDSes) have been adapted to monitor ICS, they cannot detect malicious network packets from a compromised PLC that con-form to the network protocol. A domain expert needs to manually construct IDS rules to model a PLC’s behavior. That approach is time-consuming and error-prone. Alternatively, machine learning can infer a PLC’s behavior model from network traces, but that model may be inaccurate due to a lack of high-quality training data. This paper presents CoToRu - a toolchain that takes in the PLC’s code to automatically generate a comprehensive set of IDS rules. CoToRu comprises (1) an analyzer that parses PLC code to build a state transition table for modeling the PLC’s behavior, and (2) a generator that instantiates IDS rules for detecting deviations in PLC behavior. The generated rules can be imported into Zeek IDS to detect various attacks. We apply CoToRu to a power grid testbed and show that our generated rules provide superior performance compared to existing IDSes, including those based on statistical analysis, invariant-checking, and machine learning.

With the growth in the number of Cloud Service Providers, many enterprises and organizations can use and associate services from multiple providers. There may be many Internet protocols for service access standards that are used to ensure interoperability between users browser and Web server, such as Representational State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Each service has its specific characteristics such as authentication and security requirements. Hence, Cloud providers attempt to lock customers into proprietary interfaces so consumers can find themselves at not expects inevitable vendor lock-in. Therefore, the focus of our paper is to propose a solution to this problem by using Cloud intermediate between Cloud providers and consumer in heterogeneous Cloud environments interfaces. This is to achieve benefits such as standardization and interoperability, minimizing lock-in of Cloud providers. To reach such benefits, we propose a Cloud SaaS based on two interfaces and an internet component. These interfaces are used in Cloud Consumer and Provider sides and therefore guarantee communication between Cloud Consumer and Provider using different Internet protocols for Web service access such as REST and SOAP. Our approach guarantees interoperability and standardization in heterogeneous Cloud based environments because in this case Cloud Consumer and Provider using REST interface can communicate easily with Cloud Provider and Consumer using SOAP interface.","","978-1-4673-8712-5","10.1109/WICT.2015.7489640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489640","CloudComputing;Heterogeneous Cloud;SOAP;REST;Web Service;Standarization;Interoperability","Cloud computing;Standards;Simple object access protocol;Interoperability;Protocols;Browsers","cloud computing;file servers;open systems;standardisation;Web services","cloud SaaS;interoperability;standardization;heterogeneous cloud-based environment;cloud service providers;Internet protocols;Web server;Web browser;cloud consumer-and-provider sides;Web service access","","","","8","IEEE","13 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With their inherent nature, active (Event- Condition-Action or ECA) rules are prospective candidates to carry out change detection and to provide access control. Current systems or models do not provide a flexible mechanism for enforcing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) standard and its extensions in a seamless way, and do not adapt to policy or role structure changes in enterprises, which are indispensable to make RBAC usable in diverse domains. In this paper we will show how On-When-Then-Else authorization rules (or enhanced ECA rules) are used for enforcing RBAC standard and its extensions such as generalized temporal RBAC, control flow dependency constraints, privacy-aware RBAC, and so forth in a seamless way. Furthermore, these rules also provide active security. Large enterprises have hundreds of roles, which requires thousands of rules for providing access control, and generating these rules manually is error-prone and a cognitive-burden for non-computer specialists. Thus, in this paper, we will discuss briefly how these authorization rules can be automatically (or semi-automatically) generated from high level specifications of enterprise access control policies. We will also discuss the implementation using Sentinel+, an active object oriented system.","","0-7695-2657-8","10.1109/ICDE.2005.179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1647810","","Authorization;Access control;Security;Object oriented modeling;Information technology;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Delay;Error correction;Privacy","","","","6","","32","IEEE","5 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources. Also desirable scalability is achieved: the increase in resource requirement of our solution is sub-linear with the throughput improvement.","1530-2075","978-1-4244-6443-2","10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470374","Deep packet inspection;DFA;FPGA;pipeline;string matching","Throughput;Pipelines;Field programmable gate arrays;Clocks;Intrusion detection;Inspection;Automata;Hardware;Memory architecture;Programmable logic arrays","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;pipeline processing;security of data;string matching","network intrusion detection;anti-virus systems;high-speed deep packet inspection;Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton;Snort;ClamAV;pipelined processing;linear pipeline;scalable pipeline architecture;field programmable gate array;scalable multipipeline architecture;high performance multipattern string matching;memory-efficient multipattern string matching;multicharacter input","","18","1","28","IEEE","24 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are investigating the exploitation of idle times in network resources based on a complete mode change in a candidate node. After the detection that some node is idle, a mode-switcher boots a new operating system that will work over a separate disk partition. After the boot phase the node is linked to a logical network topology and is available to receive jobs. Users can allocate nodes from this virtual cluster through a standard frontend as they would do in a ""conventional"" cluster. Because nodes may leave and join this virtual machine we use a distributed processor management to allow user applications to cope with this dynamic resource behavior.

But operating conditions within this domain strongly favour malicious actors over legitimate operators seeking to provide security and protect systems and information. Technical capabilities to establish dominance and cause damage in this domain are widely distributed, but legal and ethical constraints prevent legitimate actors from using them to their full potential. Within this context, net neutrality presents a limiting factor on the capability of legitimate actors to respond to harmful activity in cyberspace whose common aim is to install and uphold a technical imbalance. Under the principle of net neutrality, each data packet must be transmitted with equal priority, irrespective of its source, destination, content or purpose. This is disadvantageous to cyber defence. Comparisons to jungle or arctic warfare, where operating conditions are neutral and degrade the performance of each combatant side equally, are invalid, as malicious operators are capable of technically manipulating data traffic to their favour. While both malicious and legitimate actors may have comparable capabilities, legitimate actors are bound to legal and political restrictions, making them immobile in several cyber warfare scenarios. Transferring the principles of net neutrality to real life scenarios corresponds to depriving military, police and emergency operators from any privilege that allows them to respond to an incident - in effect, depriving them of their blue lights and emergency powers even in severe incidents targeting critical infrastructure that may threaten civilian lives. This paper investigates the potential opportunities and challenges of an adjustment to the principle of net neutrality to facilitate defensive action by legitimate actors; how this adjustment could contribute to regaining control in congested cyber domains in the case of national or international cyber incidents; and the risks associated. The different ways of dealing with net neutrality in cyber defence situations in the EU, UK and Russia are compared. Particular focus is put on the organisations and capabilities needed to establish technical sovereignty in multi-domain networks, including consideration of the acceptability of outsourcing the task of upholding cyber sovereignty to external institutions.","2325-5374","978-9-9499-9043-6","10.23919/CYCON.2018.8405015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8405015","net neutrality;cyber defence;cyber security;net regulation","Network neutrality;Critical infrastructure;Cyberspace;Cyber warfare;Internet","computer crime;Internet","congested domain;operating conditions;legitimate operators;technical capabilities;legitimate actors;net neutrality;malicious operators;technically manipulating data traffic;cyber warfare scenarios;police;emergency operators;national incidents;international cyber incidents;critical national infrastructure;highly contested domain;malicious actors;unprotected individual users;cyber defence;EU;UK;Russia;multidomain networks","","2","","","","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a novel machine unlearning method, called virtual federated learning approach (ViFLa), which groups training data based on estimated unlearning probability and treats each group as a virtual client in the federated learning framework. Since the virtual clients are physically in the same machine, ViFLa only leverages the concept of data/local models isolation in federated learning without incurring any network communication. ViFLa adopts an attention-based aggregation method called enhanced class distribution weighted sum (ECDWS) to tackle the nonindependent and identically distributed (non-iid) data problem caused by the data grouping strategy. It also introduces a new state transition ring mechanism into the statistical query (SQ) learning framework to update the local model of each virtual client quickly. Using real-world IoT traffic data, we showcase the benefit of ViFLa regarding its efficiency and completeness for model updates in the context of IoT traffic anomaly detection.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3214840","Huawei Technologies Canada Company Ltd., under Huawei–UVic(grant numbers:6366); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9927728","Internet of Things (IoT) traffic anomaly detection;machine unlearning;model update","Data models;Training;Anomaly detection;Internet of Things;Training data;Federated learning;Predictive models","computer network security;data handling;deep learning (artificial intelligence);firmware;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","anomaly detection model;attention-based aggregation method;called virtual federated learning approach;data grouping strategy;deep learning-based detection models;device firmware upgrades;estimated unlearning probability;fast model update;federated learning framework;IoT traffic anomaly detection;mislabeled samples;model updates;novel machine unlearning method;real-world IoT traffic data;statistical query learning framework;traffic anomaly detection systems;ViFLa;virtual client","","","","30","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Privacy is a huge concern for IoT devices as personal information is constantly being shared through them. Though the best industrial standards like end-to-end encryption are being followed to ensure content-based privacy, contextual privacy concerns still exist. This study focuses on user activity inference attacks, where a passive network observer can infer the private in-home activity of a user by analyzing encrypted IoT traffic metadata. Most of the previous solutions addressing these attacks have either reduced the usability of the devices, increased data overhead, or failed against packet-level signature-based attack scenarios. This study introduces a new defense mechanism that combines dummy packet generation with dynamic link padding. This process makes it difficult for the adversary to avail contextual information about the state of the device (ON or OFF), along with the temporal information (time of state change) from encrypted IoT traffic metadata. We reverse the packet-level signature-based attacks to get device-specific signatures, which helps us generate dummy traffic for the duration of device-specific signatures. Consequently, this results in increased false positives for device state identifications and low traffic overhead. We simulate a state-of-the-art attack scenario to test and vindicate our solution over existing data sets.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3126453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609087","Contextual privacy;Internet of Things (IoT);smart devices;traffic shaping","Smart homes;Privacy;Object recognition;Internet of Things;Metadata;Information technology;Encryption","computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;home automation;Internet of Things;telecommunication traffic","preserving contextual privacy;smart home IoT devices;dynamic traffic shaping;physical devices;personal information;end-to-end encryption;contextual privacy concerns;user activity inference attacks;passive network observer;in-home activity;encrypted IoT traffic metadata;increased data overhead;packet-level signature-based attack scenarios;dummy packet generation;dynamic link padding;contextual information;temporal information;packet-level signature-based attacks;device-specific signatures;dummy traffic;device state identifications;low traffic overhead;state-of-the-art attack scenario","","2","","20","IEEE","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant strategies for CGRAs apply either temporal or spatial scheme, including redundancy, periodic detection, workload balancing, and reconfiguration, failing to exploit the feature of dynamic and partial reconfiguration of CGRAs. Also, vulnerable judging circuits and inflexible mode shifting bottleneck the reliability design of fault-tolerant CGRAs. This paper proposes a novel multi-mode fault-tolerant framework for CGRAs, which combines spatial-redundant data-paths with temporal-redundant voters and thus reduces the vulnerable judging circuits while balancing the performance and reliability. This framework can also enable a changing reliability level at runtime via an online configuration transformation method based on pre-compiled patterns. Within the proposed framework, we systematically searched the design space spanning various combinations of the mainstream schemes with a Markov process model to compare the effectiveness and accordingly selected five points as available modes in our design after comprehensive consideration of fault tolerance and time overhead on CGRA. The framework is comprehensively evaluated on a cycle-accurate CGRA simulator, considering both permanent and transient faults. The experimental results show that the fault coverage rate of single transient faults or permanent faults has increased from 71.74% to 93.84%, which means the fault tolerance of the system has been increased by 31.03% compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

A challenging problem is the coexistence of 5G and other networks with fair, reliable, and efficient sharing of the unlicensed spectrum. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-enhanced distributed spectrum sharing scheme for coexisting multiple operators and multiple WiFi APs. We design a novel lightweight and efficient consensus mechanism, named Proof of Strategy (PoG). In this consensus mechanism, the problem of spectrum sharing is used as a consensus puzzle, and the part of the unlicensed spectrum is used as the ‘fee’ of miners. With such a design, the computing overhead of the consensus process is expected to be reduced significantly. We develop a non-cooperative game to analyze the behavior of the miners and obtain a symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium under the uniform distribution of mining cost estimation. It can be found mathematically and experimentally that the strategy of the winner tends to maximize the system revenue by sharing the unlicensed spectrum resource. Furthermore, to reduce the impact of heavy interactions on system throughput, the operation of WiFi APs in the proposed scheme can be adaptively switched between ‘contention mode’ and ‘blockchain mode’ according to the network traffic load. The dynamic behavior is constructed as an evolutionary game, and the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium points are proved by theoretical analysis. Simulations demonstrated the fairness and effectiveness of the proposed blockchain-based scheme and the mode switching method for distributed spectrum sharing by heterogeneous wireless networks.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3170577","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFE0117500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171104); EU H2020 Project COSAFE(grant numbers:MSCA-RISE-2018-824019); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; Marie Skłodowska-Curie(grant numbers:824019,101022280); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9764623","Blockchain;spectrum sharing;unlicensed spectrum","Wireless fidelity;Blockchains;Wireless networks;Resource management;Cellular networks;Throughput;Switches","Bayes methods;blockchains;cognitive radio;game theory;radio spectrum management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","blockchain enhanced coexistence;heterogeneous networks;highly congested licensed spectrum;unlicensed spectrum resource;fair sharing;blockchain-enhanced distributed spectrum;efficient consensus mechanism;spectrum sharing;consensus puzzle;consensus process;network traffic load;blockchain-based scheme;heterogeneous wireless networks","","2","","39","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The working state model of current transformer is built based on the closed-loop ARMAX model. Combing the ARMAX Model identification with MOEA/D tendency guidance, the characteristic of fault mode for high voltage transformer is proposed. The comparative validation experiment is conducted for 30 consecutive days at a 15VA current transformer and a3.75VA current transformer. The results show that the estimated value of ratio error can reflect actual state changes, which can be used to identify the fault status of the high voltage current transformer.

A fundamental challenge is ARM disassembly. ARM, particularly AArch32, has a number of unique features making disassembly distinct from x86 disassembly, such as the mixing of ARM and Thumb instruction modes, implicit mode switching within an application, and more prevalent use of inlined data. Existing techniques cannot achieve high accuracy when binaries become complex and have undergone obfuscation. We propose a novel ARM binary disassembly technique that is particularly designed to address challenges in legacy code for 32-bit ARM binaries. It features a lightweight superset instruction interpretation method to derive rich semantic information and a graph-theory based method that aggregates such information to produce final results. Our comparative evaluation with a number of state-of-the-art disassemblers, including Ghidra, IDA, P-Disasm, XDA, D-Disasm, and Spedi, on thousands of binaries generated from SPEC2000 and SPEC2006 with various settings, and real-world applications collected online show that our technique D-ARM substantially outperforms the baselines.","2375-1207","978-1-6654-9336-9","10.1109/SP46215.2023.10179307","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10179307","Program-and-binary-analysis","Privacy;Codes;Aggregates;Semantics;Thumb;Switches;Static analysis","","","","","","51","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A “source–storage–load” coordinated master–slave control strategy is proposed in this study to address the aforementioned issues. The system voltage and frequency will be stable as long as the output frequency and voltage of the master resource are stable. Furthermore, it can fully utilize the power supply capacity of resources to support the supply–demand balance. The following tasks are included in the proposed strategy: 1) to improve the operational security in the face of load disruption, a source–storage–load coordinated control method based on the “ramping speed” ratio is proposed, which can quickly restore the balance of supply and demand; 2) to improve the communication reliability in the face of interruption, a channel planning method is proposed, which can address the communication interruption problem by constructing an internal network among source–storage–load; and 3) to improve the mode switching stability of resources subjected to external disturbance, the external disturbance suppression and stability analysis involved in the regulation process are completed using sliding-mode control and small signal model methods.

"A Secure and Reliable Platform Configuration Change Reporting Mechanism for Trusted Computing Enhanced Secure Channels","K. Dietrich","Microcomputing Laboratory, Institute for Applied Information Processing and Communications (IAIK), Graz, Austria","2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","12 Dec 2008","2008","","","2137","2142","The security of well established secure channel technologies like transport layer security (TLS) or IP security (IPSec) can be significantly improved by emerging concepts like trusted computing. The use of trusted platform modules (TPMs) offers new methods for improving the security of these well established technologies. How secure channel technologies can be adapted to use trusted computing concepts is subject to current research. A major part of this research addresses the integration of the TCG's specified remote attestation. Remote attestation enables a platform to provide a trustworthy proof of its current configuration (i.e. software that has been loaded on the platform). Hence, based on this proof, a remote platform can decide whether to open a channel to another platform or not. In current approaches, the proof of the platform configuration is processed before a secure channel is established, which is not opened if the reported configuration is not accepted by the hosts. However, one important problem has not been solved yet. Currently, no satisfying solution how the change of a platform's configuration can be securely and reliably reported to the remote platform whilst a channel is open, exists. A reliable method to provide a proof for a configuration change can be implemented with only minor modifications of the TPM specification and the TLS protocol. Experimental results show that it is possible to implement this proof mechanism with only a few additional TPM commands.","","978-0-7695-3398-8","10.1109/ICYCS.2008.530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4709304","Trusted computing;platform configuration reporting;secure channels;TLS","Information security;Computer security;Protocols;Proposals;Cryptography;Information processing;Laboratories;Information retrieval;Certification","computer network reliability;cryptographic protocols;IP networks;telecommunication channels;telecommunication security;transport protocols","reliable platform configuration change reporting mechanism;trusted computing;secure channel technology;transport layer security;IP security;trusted platform module;TLS protocol;TPM specification;cryptographic protocol","","1","1","14","IEEE","12 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It identifies the breakers required for isolating the contingency equipment. This provides additional accuracy of post contingency results and provides important data to ensure the remedial action schemes are emulated correctly. Each contingency is simulated in contingency analysis by opening these breakers to evaluate their impact to the system. The ability to recognize and respect the status of manually operated switches is important to ensure the simulation mimics protection schemes. Any non-contingency equipment forced out as a result of these breaker openings, also called sympathetic outages, will be added to the contingency equipment list.

However security is lagging behind this trend; it is as important to stakeholders as performance and availability, but is generally not included in the scope of service-level agreements between stakeholders, and handled instead on a best-effort basis, without any transparency nor SLA with their clients. One reason for this is the difficulty of objectively measuring security. Indeed, the actual security level of a system is dependent on a wide range of factors, some intrinsic to the system - such as a design or implementation mistake resulting in a vulnerability - and some extrinsic to it. For instance, an external event such as the publication of a vulnerability in an open-source software dependency or a change of political context in a country can widely impact the risks faced by an information system even if no actual change were made to the system. These factors are even more numerous in multi-tenant cloud infrastructures because of the sheer number of actors involved - and their sometimes conflicting incentives - and opportunities for both attack and defense at scale. Security monitoring aims to detect and react to attacks in real time; Reactive security monitoring intends to take external events into account while doing so. Improving the accuracy of a system's overall security assessment can help transitioning security to a SLA paradigm and enable better transparency for all stakeholders.","","978-1-5386-5175-9","10.1109/FAS-W.2018.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599521","Security;Cloud;SLA;IDS","Security;Software;Cloud computing;Information systems;Prototypes;Monitoring;Contracts","cloud computing;contracts;public domain software;security of data","multitenant cloud;external event;security assessment;transparency;adaptive security monitoring;cloud computing;service-level agreements;information systems stakeholders;financial penalties;best-effort basis;actual security level;open-source software dependency;information system;actual change;reactive security monitoring","","2","","17","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In real time environment, data-base may be created by keeping the record of operating states by state estimation. The severity of contingency for each case with respect to different contingencies (single line outages) is assessed by number of secure and insecure operating states, which is predicted by CBR. Security classes are defined by threshold value of maximum loadability margins, calculated using the continuation power flow analysis.

On the other hand, trust management systems are designed to deal with selfish behaviors or internal attacks and not to assist cryptographic measures. Our solution evaluates the trust level related to the presence of security threats among nodes, and adapt consequently cryptographic measures.

""Having Divided to Conquer We Must Reunite [to] Rule"". Decomposition of problems and systems into smaller, more manageable units has been at the heart of software engineering practice for decades. ""Separation of concerns"" gives software engineers the conceptual and practical tools to focus their attention, and their tools, on the parts of the problem or solution to which they are best suited. Perhaps one of the earliest boundaries used to separate concerns is that which exists between hardware and software - once that boundary is drawn, software engineers were able to focus their attention on the development of software within the hardware boundaries chosen. There has however, been a steady erosion of such boundaries: digital and physical connectivity have become the norm, and increasingly such connectivity can be ad hoc, spontaneous, and often unplanned (perhaps best exemplified by the Internet of Things paradigm). Moreover, the fluid and disappearing boundaries between technology and people have radically affected social behaviours (again, perhaps well exemplified by the proliferation of mobile and ubiquitous computing such as wearable and 'smart' technologies used in variety of personal and community settings). Such convergence between digital, physical, and social spaces has provided exciting opportunities for software engineers to, literally, 'cross boundaries', and, as a result, to have an impact on the physical and social worlds in which the software they build will operate. But in this brave new world with porous boundaries, security engineering and privacy management challenges abound. Effective security depends on the ability to control access to assets protected by boundaries. Effective privacy management depends on informed, consensual sharing of information across boundaries. Our thesis is that, although increasingly invisible, and rightly so, explicit awareness and sometimes representation of boundaries in cyber-physical-social systems facilitate good old fashioned separation of concerns, which in turn enables more effective software engineering of secure, privacy-aware software. We support our thesis with examples from our research in adaptive security and privacy.","","978-1-5386-4043-2","10.1109/SEsCPS.2017.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968016","adaptive security and privacy;cyber-physical-social systems","Software;Security;Privacy;Software engineering;Tools;Conferences;Cyber-physical systems","software engineering","crossing boundaries;digital spaces;physical spaces;social spaces;software engineering practice;software engineers;physical connectivity;Internet of Things;mobile computing;ubiquitous computing;wearable;smart technologies;porous boundaries;security engineering;privacy management;cyber-physical-social systems;privacy-aware software;adaptive security","","","","","IEEE","7 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we describe an approach detailing key steps and activities to create an adaptive security solution. The architecture conforms to the MAPE-K reference model, which is a widely applied reference model in autonomic computing. Steps include: Establishing a control point to force control of the security decision process from the existing system. Identifying an environment parameter with which the security will trade off. Studying the interrelationship between security and the environment parameter in the existing system context by identifying measurable factors which influence their relationship. Formulation of a trade-off goal which is optimised based on multiple objectives, one of which is a security objective. Consequently, the proposed approach is capable of deploying mechanisms adaptive security to satisfy different security needs at different conditions.","","978-1-5090-1018-9","10.1109/SWSTE.2016.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7515422","Dynamic Systems;Adaptive Security;Autonomic Computing;MAPE-K;Security @ Runtime","Security;Runtime;Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Monitoring;Computer architecture;Context","fault tolerant computing;security of data","monitor-analyse-plan-execute-knowledge model;adaptive security mechanisms;environment parameter;security decision process;control point;autonomic computing;MAPE-K reference model;adaptive security solution;MaPE-K-based approach","","4","","13","IEEE","21 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Running security algorithm on cluster to combat the security threats increases overall execution overhead. Thus a scheduling algorithm should balance between these two conflicting requirements. In this paper, we have proposed a window based scheduling algorithm which accepts tasks with minimum security requirements and later on adaptively increases security level of task.

The system security constraints are in fact boundaries that surround all possible operating modes (scenarios) of the power system. In other words, these boundaries form the feasible operating domain - in the parameter space spanned by various operating variables - within which the system can safely be operated. For a given operating scenario, the associated security level is measured by the “distance” (for example, the Euclidean norm) of the operating point from the security region boundary. This paper reports on the results of a recently completed research and development paper, which included the development of innovative computerized schemes, which are capable of identifying dynamic operating security modes during the on-line operation of electric power systems. The methodology adopted in this paper includes the development of advanced, highly efficient computerized algorithms for fast identification of dynamic operating security modes of power systems. One of the salient outcomes of this paper is the development of a novel framework for identification and representation of operating security regions in power systems as well as evaluation of security levels associated with different operating scenarios.

It provides real-time packet flows with guaranteed quality of service (QoS) while adaptively controls the packet's confidentiality security service level. The proposed scheme is modeled using the object-oriented multi-agent methodology. By applying a buffer estimation technique at the network's end nodes, the algorithm provides a real-time network congestion control hence satisfying the network performance metrics.

A security meta-model has been developed in which the traditional role concept has been extended. The new concept incorporates the need of both security management as used by role-based access control (RBAC) and agent functional behaviour in agent-oriented Software Engineering (AOSE). Our approach avoids weaknesses of traditional RBAC approaches and provides a practically usable security model for multi-agent systems (MAS). A unified role interaction model framework has been put forward that incorporates not only functional requirements but also security constraints in MAS. A security policy rule scheme has been used to express security requirements in relation to affective roles. The major contribution of the work is that little redevelopment effort will be required when security is to be engineered into the overall MAS architecture, hence minimising the impact of the security requirements changes to the MAS architecture. We illustrate the approach through its potential application in a clinical trial setting involving a prototype medical decision support system, HealthAgents.","0730-3157","0-7695-2870-8","10.1109/COMPSAC.2007.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4291134","","Security;Multiagent systems;Clinical trials;Engineering management;Access control;Software engineering;Biomedical engineering;Design engineering;Prototypes;Decision support systems","decision support systems;medical computing;metacomputing;multi-agent systems;security of data;software engineering","adaptive security model;multiagent systems;clinical trials environment;security metamodel;role-based access control;agent-oriented software engineering;unified role interaction model framework;medical decision support a system","","14","","13","IEEE","20 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cyber-Physical Systems can be harmed through both cyber-enabled or physically-enabled attacks, particularly ones that exploit the often ignored interplay between the cyber and physical spaces characterizing a system operating environment. Awareness of the topology of the operating environment of systems as well as its dynamics can support adaptive security more effectively. In this talk I propose the use of Bigraphical Reactive Systems to represent the topology of cyber and physical spaces. I describe how to use this representation to reason about the consequences of the evolution of topological configurations on the satisfaction of security requirements. I also illustrate a planning technique to identify an adaptation strategy to be used at runtime, to circumvent, prevent, or mitigate security requirements violations previously identified. Finally I will describe how this approach has been integrated into an existing commercial access control software.","","978-1-5386-2797-6","10.1109/SER-IP.2017..21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964357","","Security;Topology;Software;Conferences;Software engineering;Cyber-physical systems;Adaptive systems","authorisation;cyber-physical systems","cyber-physical systems;physically-enabled attacks;cyber-enabled attacks;system operating environment;bigraphical reactive systems;planning technique;adaptation strategy;commercial access control software","","","","","IEEE","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Engineering adaptive security is not an easy task. A set of effective security countermeasures should be identified. These countermeasures should not only be applied to (primary) assets that customers desire to protect, but also to other (secondary) assets that can be exploited by attackers to harm the primary assets. Another challenge arises when assets vary dynamically at runtime. To accommodate these variabilities, it is necessary to monitor changes in assets, and apply the most appropriate countermeasures at runtime. The paper provides three main contributions for engineering adaptive security. First, it proposes a modeling notation to represent primary and secondary assets, along with their variability. Second, it describes how to use the extended models in engineering security requirements and designing required monitoring functions. Third, the paper illustrates our approach through a set of adaptive security scenarios in the customer domain of a smart grid. We suggest that modeling secondary assets aids the deployment of countermeasures, and, in combination with a representation of assets variability, facilitates the design of monitoring functions.","2157-2321","978-1-4673-1787-0","10.1109/SEAMS.2012.6224403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6224403","Adaptive security;Smart grid;Assets;Adaptive software","Security;Home appliances;Smart grids;Cameras;Monitoring;Buildings;Energy management","asset management;power engineering computing;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","valuable asset management;security control;security countermeasures;primary assets;engineering adaptive security requirement;secondary assets;customer domain;smart grid;asset variability;monitoring function","","4","","8","IEEE","25 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ICS underpin sensitive and critical national infrastructures such as water treatment and energy production and transportation. The consequences of a successful attack against them can lead to shutting the infrastructure down which has major impacts such as production stoppages or safety implications for people, the environment, and assets. At the same time, running a process while the infrastructure is under attack or compromised also has safety im-plications, potentially catastrophic. This work-in-progress focuses on an adaptive approach, able to alter the defensive posture while providing assurances about operational capacity (or downgrading it) and safety. Our approach involves transforming policies from simply a means to enforce security requirements defined a priori, to adaptive objects that are capable to evolve in response to unfolding attacks.

CA studies the impact of equipment outage on the system. This paper presents the dynamic contingency redefinition in power system security analysis. Contingency definition is usually accomplished in an off-line development environment. The pre-defined contingency cases are studied in the off-line or on-line contingency analysis program. Usually the contingency definition defines hypothetical equipment outage or fault. It does not explicitly specify the isolating breakers of the fault. The dynamic contingency re-definition takes into account the actual response of protection subsystem to the equipment outage. It identifies the breakers required for isolating the contingency equipment. This provides additional accuracy of post contingency results to ensure the analysis accuracy and the remedial action schemes emulated correctly. Each re-defined contingency is simulated in CA by opening these breakers to evaluate their impact on the system. The ability to respect the status of manually operated switches is important to ensure the simulation mimics protection schemes. Any non-contingency equipment forced out as a result of these breaker openings will be added to the contingency equipment list. All outage equipment and breakers will be listed on the contingency definition display for each contingency case.

The close dependency of major transmission paths requires an approach that takes that interaction into account while establishing operational transfer capability, and evaluates grid reliability and security on a system-wide basis. Thus, the concept of wide-area security region, which considers all essential constraints, including thermal, voltage stability, transient stability, and small signal stability, is proposed. This approach expands the idea of traditional transmission system nomograms to a multidimensional case, involving multiple system limits and parameters such as transmission path constraints, zonal generation or load, etc., considered concurrently. In this paper, the security region boundary is represented using piecewise approximation with the help of linear inequalities (so called hyperplanes) in a multidimensional space, consisting of system parameters that are critical for security analysis. The goal of this approximation is to find a minimum set of hyperplanes that describe the boundary with a given accuracy. Offline computer simulations are conducted to build the security region and the hyperplanes can be applied in real time with phasor information for on-line security assessment. Numerical simulations have been performed for the full size Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system model, which comprises 15 126 buses and 3034 generators.

It is impossible to describe the operation state of power grid more accurately by physical modeling based solely on electrical data. Therefore, through the analysis and utilization of electrical data and non-electrical data, this paper uses the information physical fusion model constructed by multi-information sources to replace the traditional electrical model. The improved in formation physics fusion model realizes more comprehensive and accurate monitoring and estimation of power grid operation state. The example in this paper realizes the monitoring of the operation state of the power grid through the parameter fusion model of transformer and transmission line, and identifies the small operation faults of the power grid. Besides, the dynamic parameters derived from the fusion model are used to estimate the operation state, and the overall estimation of power grid with missing measurements is realized.","","978-1-7281-3137-5","10.1109/EI247390.2019.9062205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9062205","multiple information sources;big data application s;information physics fusion model;state estimation;power grid operation","Power grids;Transmission line measurements;Power system dynamics;Power transmission lines;Power measurement;Data models;Oil insulation","power engineering computing;power grids;power system security;sensor fusion","grid operating state;multiple information sources;power grid measurement devices;nonelectrical data;physical modeling;electrical data;information physical fusion model;multiinformation sources;formation physics fusion model;power grid operation state;parameter fusion model","","","","6","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To ascertain this, analysis and calculation plays an important role. Power system calculations can be classified into three categories in time domain: for the past, for the present and for the future respectively. And the calculations for the future seem to be more significant to support power system operation and make production arrangement. However, almost all the calculations of power system are based on the mathematic models established from the physical system; and the models may have various errors and mismatch the actual system, especially for the calculations facing the future. The mismatch between calculation model and actual system influences the analysis result and the operation of power system. Aimed at the possible mismatch between calculation model and actual power system, this paper analyzes the influences of bus operating mode, transmission line operating mode, load distribution and quantity respectively on power system transient stability. The results show that the mismatch of grid structure can influence power system stability more greatly than loads do. As the mismatch between calculation model and actual system always exists, this paper also suggests that power system analysis should depend more on measurements rather than calculation model.","1947-1270","981-05-5702-7","10.1109/IPEC.2005.207076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1627365","T error analysis;model mismatch;power system;transient stability analysis;WAMS","Power system modeling;Power system stability;Power system analysis computing;Power system reliability;Power system transients;Mathematical model;Production systems;Mathematics;Power transmission lines;Stability analysis","power system transient stability;power system security;load distribution;power transmission reliability;time-domain analysis","model mismatch;power system calculation;power system reliability;power system security;time domain;production arrangement;power system calculations;bus operating mode;transmission line operating mode;load distribution;power system transient stability","","","","29","","8 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The higher level of uncertainty that stems from this variability makes it more difficult to determine whether a given operating condition will be secure or insecure. Data-driven techniques provide a promising way to identify security rules that can be embedded in economic dispatch model to keep power system operating states secure. This paper proposes using a sparse weighted oblique decision tree to learn accurate, understandable, and embeddable security rules that are linear and can be extracted as sparse matrices using a recursive algorithm. These matrix rules can then be easily embedded as security constraints in power system economic dispatch calculations using the Big-M method. Tests on several large datasets with high renewable energy penetration demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the sparse weighted oblique decision tree outperforms the state-of-art weighted oblique decision tree while keeping the security rules simple. When embedded in the economic dispatch, these rules significantly increase the percentage of secure states and reduce the average solution time.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2020.3019383","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2017YFB0902200); Science and Technology Foundation of State Grid Corporation of China(grant numbers:5228001700CW); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51620105007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177087","Data-driven;High renewable penetration;Oblique decision tree;Power system security;Sparsity;rules extraction;security-constrained economic dispatch;security-constrained optimal power flow","Security;Decision trees;Power system stability;Economics;Sparse matrices;Optimization;Renewable energy sources","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power system security;sparse matrices","sparse weighted oblique decision tree;accurate security rules;understandable, security rules;embeddable security rules;sparse matrices;matrix rules;security constraints;power system economic dispatch calculations;high renewable energy penetration;state-of-art weighted oblique decision tree;secure states;sparse oblique decision tree;power system security rules extraction;variable generation;substantial effect;operational reliability;power systems;given operating condition;data-driven techniques;economic dispatch model;power system operating states","","15","","35","IEEE","25 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We have showed that an optimum trade-off mitigation response in the IoT can be automated by assessing various contextual requirements, such as the QoS and user preferences, thing capabilities, and the risk faced, at runtime. eHealth scenarios are examined to illustrate system application in IoT-based remote patient monitoring systems.","","978-1-9083-2052-0","10.1109/ICITST.2015.7412122","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7412122","Internet of Things;Adaptive Security;eHealth;Event Driven Architecture","Security;Adaptation models;Monitoring;Context;Measurement;Risk management;Internet","Internet of Things;medical computing;patient monitoring;quality of service;security of data","security trade-offs management;Internet of Things;dynamic trade-off decisions;IoT;scenario-based approach;event-driven adaptive security model;EDAS model;optimum trade-off mitigation response;QoS;user preferences;ehealth scenarios;remote patient monitoring systems","","9","","15","","25 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identifying and evaluating assets are therefore key activities in any security engineering process - from modeling threats and attacks, discovering existing vulnerabilities, to selecting appropriate countermeasures. However, despite their crucial role, assets are often neglected during the development of secure software systems. Indeed, many systems are designed with fixed security boundaries and assumptions, without the possibility to adapt when assets change unexpectedly, new threats arise, or undiscovered vulnerabilities are revealed. To handle such changes, systems must be capable of dynamically enabling different security countermeasures. This paper promotes assets as first-class entities in engineering secure software systems. An asset model is related to requirements, expressed through a goal model, and the objectives of an attacker, expressed through a threat model. These models are then used as input to build a causal network to analyze system security in different situations, and to enable, when necessary, a set of countermeasures to mitigate security threats. The causal network is conceived as a runtime entity that tracks relevant changes that may arise at runtime, and enables a new set of countermeasures. We illustrate and evaluate our proposed approach by applying it to a substantive example concerned with security of mobile phones.","2332-6441","978-1-4673-2785-5","10.1109/RE.2012.6345794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345794","Security requirements;Adaptation;Causal reasoning","Security;Adaptation models;Runtime;Mobile handsets;Credit cards;Analytical models;Usability","security of data;software engineering;systems analysis","requirements-driven adaptive security;security engineering process;secure software systems;undiscovered vulnerabilities;security countermeasures;secure software engineering systems;variable asset protection","","43","","25","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the second stage, a multi-mode data-driven local control strategy is designed in real-time Volt/Var control (VVC) with three operation modes, which are energy saving mode, reactive power reservation mode and security operation mode respectively. The coordination and transition among different control modes allow system operators to achieve both energy savings and voltage security under various conditions. The flexible reactive power margin of PVs can also be adaptively improved through cooperation with CBs. Moreover, a data-driven deep convolution neural network (CNN) is developed and trained as a local controller (LC) to regulate the reactive power of PVs based on local measurements. The influence of input selections on training losses is analyzed in detail, and a clustering-based data preprocessing method is also proposed to simplify the training process without compromising the training performance.

Present-day power systems are dynamic in nature, where the network topology frequently changes with load demand. With increase in load, the power system network is loaded to its limits, making it susceptible to collapse even under minor disturbances. In order to operate the power system economically, the current operating state of the system must be identified as either secure or insecure. An artificial neural network (ANN) aided method for security assessment is proposed and illustrated for a model six-bus power system. The work demonstrates the feasibility of classification of load patterns for power system static security assessment using a Kohonen self-organizing feature map. The most important aspect of this network is its generalization property. Using 15 different line-loading patterns for training, the network successfully classifies the unknown loading patterns. This powerful and versatile feature is especially useful for power system operation.

In the prior-art grid resilience studies, the hurricanes or wildfires are mainly defended in terms of expected line damages, while they are prone to trigger short-circuit fault (SCF) evolved with dynamic influence in reality. In this paper, a fragile model is developed to evaluate the nodal SCF probability considering the insulation aging of equipment and extreme weather condition. Then, a response framework for extreme weather events is developed for a transmission system to defend the cascading impacts of expected SCFs. Specifically, switches are shifted to restrain the out-of-range short-circuit currents (SCCs) so that to ensure the SCFs can be removed by circuit breakers, generation rescheduling and load shedding are arranged to maintain the post-fault system transient stability. The above measures are optimized simultaneously by an integrated Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP). Considering the error or uncertainty of weather event forecasts, a multi-state model is established to provide the most cost-effective grid resilience enhancement scheme, in which the expected urgent adaptions of the initial scheme subject to weather state transition is included in the overall cost. The proposed model and techniques are validated using the IEEE 39-bus New-England test system and realistic meteorological data.","1937-4208","","10.1109/TPWRD.2020.3043938","China NSFC(grant numbers:51807173); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290096","Resilience;extreme weather;short-circuit fault;short-circuit current;transient stability;multi-state","Meteorology;Power system stability;Aging;Hurricanes;Circuit faults;Transient analysis;Resilience;Climate change","circuit breakers;integer programming;load shedding;nonlinear programming;power grids;power system reliability;power system security;power system transient stability;probability;short-circuit currents","multistate model;transmission system resilience enhancement;short-circuit fault;extreme weather events;global climate change;power systems;prior-art grid resilience studies;expected line damages;fragile model;nodal SCF probability;extreme weather condition;expected SCFs;out-of-range short-circuit currents;circuit breakers;post-fault system transient stability;weather event forecasts;cost-effective grid resilience enhancement scheme;expected urgent adaptions;IEEE 39-bus New-England test system","","80","","34","IEEE","10 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional protection systems are non-adaptive and have been usually applied with bias towards dependability, one of the two considerations on designing electric grid protection systems (the other one is security). The art and science of protection and control of tomorrow drives the power system professionals to design and implement schemes that are adaptive and aim towards security. It is important to minimize system exposures when the power system is in a stressed state or in early stages of a sequence of events to halt or mitigate disturbance propagation. One of the leading contributions to the future of grid protection would be to avoid incorrect tripping of unaffected equipment therefore maintaining the power system integrity. In addition, with the ever-increasing load demand and the advent of the deregulated power market recently, power systems are pushed more often to operate close to design limits and with more uncertainty of the system operating mode. The proposed protection systems offer adaptive concepts by adjusting the need for more dependability or security as applicable, through the application of fuzzy logic and based on a set of real-time factors, such as system state index, nodal price, and equipment outage impact index. Results from our work can be used as a roadmap for further enhancement leading to the introduction of algorithms in commercial products.","2160-8563","978-1-4244-1903-6","10.1109/TDC.2008.4517163","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4517163","Dependability;security;fuzzy logic;protection systems;adaptive","Power system protection;Power system security;Power systems;Art;Control systems;Power system control;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Power markets;Uncertainty","fuzzy logic;power markets;power system protection;power system security","electric power system protection;power system security;load demand;power market deregulation;fuzzy logic","","1","","17","IEEE","12 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the planning stage, the defender can utilize software diversity, which is a common phenomenon that the cyber software of different substations comes from different competing vendors. Therefore, different kinds of software may not be exposed to the same zero-day security loophole, preventing the attacker from taking charge of multiple substations at the same time. In this paper, the optimal scheme of software deployment considering long-term risk mitigation is studied. Firstly, the framework of diversity-based cyber defense against malicious attacks is formulated. Secondly, the risk index based on representative attack patterns is constructed, which is the objective to be minimized. Thirdly, considering that the deployment scheme is long-term stable while the operating mode varies with time, we construct a multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming to mitigate the average risk of operating modes. Then the optimization problem is solved by the multiobjective genetic algorithm. Lastly, results of the IEEE 39-node CPPS and and the Virtual European Grid demonstrate that the proposed method can considerably reduce the attack risk.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2021.3086681","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2017YFB0903000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1766203); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447199","Cyber-physical power system;multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA);nonlinear integer programming;risk mitigation;stochastic programming;software diversity","Substations;Cyberattack;Software;Power systems;Indexes;Security;Risk management","computer crime;cyber-physical systems;genetic algorithms;nonlinear programming;power engineering computing;power generation protection;power grids;power system security;risk management;software engineering;stochastic programming;substations","diversity-based cyber defense;malicious attacks;risk index;representative attack patterns;attack risk;software deployment;long-term risk mitigation;cyber-physical power systems;wide-area cyber attacks;software diversity;cyber software;zero-day security loophole;substations;multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming;optimization;multiobjective genetic algorithm;IEEE 39-node CPPS;virtual European grid","","1","","38","IEEE","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ultimate goal of an IDPS system is to stop security attacks before they have been carried successfully. This paper proposed an efficient network-based IDPS System which takes multiple counteractions against network attacks. The proposed system's first reaction after detecting malicious packets is to generate an alert and log them; if the number of packets goes beyond threshold limit in one second, the second counteraction takes place to block the attackers IP address through firewall. Finally, if the system fails to block these packets, the third counteraction takes place to remotely stop the corresponding service. In this case the system prevents an attack from being successfully carried.","","978-1-5090-3294-5","10.1109/ICIIECS.2017.8276023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8276023","IDS;IPS system;Network security;Network attack prevention;Intrusion Prevention System;NIDPS","IP networks;Databases;Firewalls (computing);Ports (Computers);Web servers","firewalls;Internet;IP networks","firewall;network-based IDPS system;network-based intrusion detection;information security;ultimate goal;IDS/IPS Systems;mobile systems;multimode counteractions;prevention system;attackers IP address;counteraction;malicious packets;network attacks;multiple counteractions;security attacks","","6","","18","IEEE","1 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Users collect the image data where people need attention together with the location data from GPS and its comments by UMPC (Ultra-Mobile PC) or mobile phone outside. Currently, UMPC is used for the system development to temporarily overcome the limitations of application development on the mobile-phone, although data collection using mobile-phone must be a successful solution. Collected data are sent to a server machine, and the server machine automatically creates the information map that collected images and comments are arranged based on location data sent together. The created map is also published on the Net. This implementation is based on Ajax, using Google Maps API and JavaScript. The data collection can be done by several users and stored at a server space for each projects.

In this paper, we describe a methodology for analyzing and understanding the RBAC-configuration evolution, its relation to the overall evolutionary lifecycle of industrial systems, and its impact on security vulnerabilities from which the system may suffer. Our methodology considers two different sources of information regarding the RBAC-configuration evolution: 1) the role-permissions matrices of subsequent system versions; and 2) the corresponding concept lattices, implied by these matrices. By examining the evolution of these two system properties, developers can easily notice which versions involve more and more complex RBAC-configuration changes that may indicate higher security risks.

Analysis of the current operating state and prediction of plausible future insecurity is crucial for real-time decision-making and implementation of necessary control strategies to ensure secure operation of bulk power systems. On-line security assessment demands low complexity and computational time. The traditional methods of assessment of dynamic security of electric power systems often prove to be inadequate for online and real-time conditions due to their high complexity and long computation time. This article proposes a pattern recognition approach to dynamic security analysis for large and complex power systems using ensemble decision tree to form reliable decision rules for fast and accurate prediction of power system's operating states in a real-time and on-line environment. An ensemble security predictor (ENSP) was developed and trained to act as “dynamic security state predictor” to predict and classify power system's dynamic operating states into secure, insecure, and intermediate transitional classes. Two different case studies were performed on IEEE 118-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed method on systems of varying size and complexity. While prediction accuracy of some of the single-learner classifiers decreased considerably when implemented on a large sized system, the performance of ENSP declined marginally, and the results were acceptable for very large sized systems.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2020.2978504","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9044298","Classification;dynamic security;ensemble decision tree;feature extraction;feature selection;pattern recognition;power system transient stability;prediction","Security;Power system stability;Power system dynamics;Decision trees;Real-time systems;Feature extraction;Training","decision making;decision trees;IEEE standards;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;power engineering computing;power system security","ensemble security predictor;IEEE 300-bus systems;ensemble decision tree-based power system dynamic security state predictor;real-time decision-making;computational time;electric power system control;complex power systems;on-line security assessment;IEEE 118-bus system","","16","","25","IEEE","23 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With new requirements imposed by SOA-based business models, adaptive security enforcement on the application level becomes even more important. Our work on the enforcement framework to date has resulted in a comprehensive middleware-based solution leveraging on Web services technologies. However, potential merits of hardware-based solutions to further secure application exposure have not been considered so far. This paper describes a method for combining software resource level security features offered by Web services technologies, with the hardware-based security mechanisms offered by trusted computing platform and system virtualisation approaches. In particular, we propose trust-based architecture for protecting the enforcement middleware deployed at the policy enforcement endpoints of Web and grid services. The main motivation is to additionally secure execution environment of the applications, by providing virtual machine level separation that maps from logical domains imposed by Web services level enforcement policies.","","0-7695-2924-0","10.1109/ICWS.2007.188","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4279651","","Web services;Service oriented architecture;Hardware;Computer security;Middleware;Context-aware services;Application software;Contracts;Distributed computing;Telecommunication computing","grid computing;middleware;security of data;software architecture;virtual machines;Web services","virtualised trusted computing platform;adaptive security enforcement;Web services interactions;distributed system;service-oriented architecture;business models;middleware;software resource level security;hardware-based security mechanisms;system virtualisation;trust-based architecture;grid services;virtual machine level separation","","3","5","23","IEEE","30 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Graphical security models (e.g., Attack Graphs and Attack Trees) and security metrics (e.g., attack cost, shortest attack path) are widely used to systematically analyse the security posture of network systems. However, there are problems using them to assess the security of dynamic networks. First, the existing graphical security models are unable to capture dynamic changes occurring in the networks over time. Second, the existing security metrics are not designed for dynamic networks such that their effectiveness to the dynamic changes in the network is still unknown. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis via simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of security metrics using a Temporal Hierarchical Attack Representation Model. Further, we investigate the varying effects of security metrics when changes are observed in the dynamic networks. Our experimental analysis shows that different security metrics have varying security posture changes with respect to changes in the network.","2324-9013","978-1-5090-4906-6","10.1109/Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS.2017.248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029451","Attack Graphs;Attack Trees;Cyber Security;Graphical Security Models;Security Assessment","Security;Measurement;Servers;Analytical models;Databases;Adaptation models;Workstations","computer network security;trees (mathematics)","security metrics;dynamic networks;modern enterprise network security;configuration changes;graphical security models;attack graphs;attack trees;attack cost;shortest attack path;network system security posture;comprehensive analysis;temporal hierarchical attack representation model","","3","","17","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Method for Assessment of Security-Relevant Settings in Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection for Industrial Control Systems","R. E. Gillen; S. L. Scott",Oak Ridge National Laboratory; Tennessee Technological University,"2020 IEEE Conference on Industrial Cyberphysical Systems (ICPS)","4 Dec 2020","2020","1","","156","161","Ensuring the integrity of Ethernet-based networks is a challenging and constantly evolving domain. This problem is exacerbated for those operational technology (OT) networks supporting industrial control systems (ICS) since much of that equipment was originally designed to be on a network that was isolated and generally considered free of malefactors. Increasing pressure to bridge these systems with traditional information technology (IT) networks has introduced a bevy of new threats. In response, both academia and industry have responded with security solutions tailored to ICS environments. Deploying these protection systems often involves several configuration choices. While some of these choices are clear (e.g., block/enable protocol X) others are far more subjective (e.g. alert threshold == 3.43). Further complicating the situation, while often similar to IT networks, OT networks have unique challenges and characteristics that make the task of protecting them simultaneously more difficult and straight forward. Extant solutions for quantifying the relative security of intrusion detection systems fail to effectively support the operators of said systems with understanding the impact of various configuration changes. Further, they assume that the attacks are static and not subject to manipulation or alteration in the face of defenses. In this paper, we present a threat-based method for quantifying the relative impact of various security settings for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) within ICS environments. This method provides operational staff with a clear understanding of the relative impact of their settings and assumes that the attacks levied against them are dynamic. The model is described in detail, we apply the model to a synthetic data set, and discuss the inferences that can be made and what types of decisions they could be used to support.","","978-1-7281-6389-5","10.1109/ICPS48405.2020.9274691","Battelle; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274691","industrial control systems;intrusion detection systems;assessment;risk quantification","Security;Integrated circuits;Intrusion detection;Software;Government;Task analysis;Risk management","computer network security;industrial control;local area networks;production engineering computing","security-relevant settings;anomaly-based intrusion detection;industrial control systems;OT networks;intrusion detection systems;Ethernet-based network;operational technology networks;configuration changes;IDS;ICS","","1","","19","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Supported by big data and cloud computing, bulk power grid security defense system was divided into two parts: one is the prevention and control of operation risks. Power grid risks are eliminated and influence of random faults is reduced through measures such as network planning, power-cut scheme, risk pre-warning, equipment status monitoring, voltage control, frequency control and adjustment of operating mode. The other is the fault recovery control. By updating “three defense lines”, intelligent relay protection is used to deal with the challenges brought by EHV AC/DC hybrid grid and new energy resources.

Moreover, security risk is evaluated subjectively based on Prospect Theory to reflect realistic scenarios where the attacker and the edge system do not similarly perceive the status of the infrastructure.

The application of these abnormal contingencies to the vulnerable areas can lead to a system on the verge-of-collapse. In particular, there are two conditions that generally occur for a system to be on the verge-of-collapse: firstly, the system is in a degraded state or close to its operation limits and secondly it must be subjected to abnormal contingencies in the areas of vulnerability. The result of this study is to define areas of vulnerability in a network which can then be identified and appropriate remedial action initiated when required. Different stages are required for the protection of systems on the verge of collapse, namely: a) how to define areas of vulnerability, b) how to identify these areas of vulnerability and c) how to protect the system in the presence of areas of vulnerability.

Firstly, we proposed a uniform circular array-based multi-mode OAM system and derived the secrecy capacity. Secondly, the phase profiles, channel capacity and received power of OAM beams are analyzed in terms of various system parameters in oblique scenarios at 30GHz. Thirdly, we discussed the security of the proposed OAM wiretap system. The results show that the system using vortex waves is superior to conventional communication systems using planar electromagnetic waves in terms of system security due to the inherent divergence and spiral phase structure of OAM beams. Moreover, we found that the distortion of OAM beams during transmission and the center shift at receiving end will occur and that system is more stable for high-mode OAM propagation in oblique scenarios.

Resource and security adaptability achieved through self- and context-awareness will take the feasibility of the networks to a new level. The scheme has self- and context-awareness in addition to a holistic view of security services at each layer of the communication stack. It uses distributed agents and intrusion detection systems to monitor the security threats and then dynamically adapts its security level by jointly considering several dimensions.

After all attempts to avoid attack have been applied, some attacks will still get through. In critical systems, it is not always the best or practical thing to do to shut down the network under attack. In this paper we describe how trust in cyber assets can be modeled and used to support self-adaptive techniques in continuing to operate important computational functions in a network that is actively under attack. The paper, in particular describes the trust modeling system that attempts to maintain a model of trust for networked resources using a combination of two basic ideas: Conditional trust (based on conditional preference (CP-Nets) and the principle of maximum entropy (PME).","","978-0-7695-4895-1","10.1109/SASOW.2012.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6498379","PME entropy cp-nets cyber security trust modeling self adaptive","","data privacy;maximum entropy methods;security of data","adaptive security;adaptive trust;cyber security;cyber asset;self-adaptive technique;conditional trust;maximum entropy principle;PME;conditional preference","","5","","10","IEEE","15 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The DACS scheme performs network management efficiently through the communication control of a client. As the characteristic of DACS scheme, only the setup modification is required by a system administrator, when configuration change of the network system is done. Then, the setup modification by a customer is unnecessary, which shows a merit for both the system administrator and the customer. But, there are some security problems to be solved.

However, terrorism actions could be considered as the largest threat to the power infrastructure in some countries. The robustness and security of a power system has to be related to the ability of the system to support contingencies due to terrorism actions. Therefore, methods and techniques should be developed with the main aim of improving power system security against terrorism. To collaborate to this effort this paper proposes an extension of a well known classification of events and operating states. A classification that includes internal and external natural and unnatural or man caused events is important for proposing new security analysis methods that consider event uncertainties. Natural events are mainly random while unnatural event uncertainty are ambiguous, vague or confuse and some kind of expert elicitation should be applied. In Colombia during year 2002 about 500 towers were destroyed by terrorists.

We remedy this situation by proposing an adaptive quality of security control scheme for networked parallel disk systems (or ASPAD for short) that makes it possible for networked disk systems to adapt to changing security requirements and workload conditions. ASPAD is carried out in three phases: dynamic data partitioning, response time estimation, and adaptive security quality control. Hence, ASPAD is conducive to adaptively and expeditiously determining security schemes for disk requests in a way to improve security of networked parallel disk systems while making an effort to guarantee desired response times of the requests. To prove the efficiency of the proposed approach, we simulate a networked parallel disk system into which nine cryptographic schemes are integrated.

In the context of self-adaptive systems, adaptive security concerns with adjusting protection mechanisms at runtime while changes occur in the operating environment. One of the challenges with self-adaptation paradigm is that the reasoning engine must leverage existing requirements and constraints and at the same time deal with different types of imperfections due to absence of knowledge or data. The problem arises when the existing runtime requirements models offer no explicit support for imperfections. By imperfections, we mean the values of some attributes of interest are not available at certain points. To address this problem, we propose uncertain reasoning based on imperfect requirements using non-monotonic logic.

Usually, this direction corresponds to increasing all loads with constant power factor and the MW generated at generation buses by using one loading factor only. However, situations may occur where small variations in this direction, as for example, an unexpected load increase at any bus or set of buses, may result in smaller VSSM, thus leading the system to an insecure operating state. The goal of this paper is to propose a combination of a fast method to estimate the VSSM with an efficient method to calculate the appropriate direction of load increase for which the margin is minimum. This information, along with the usual VSSM, can provide system operators with relevant information regarding the system's security. More complete information allow operators to take decisions like preventive control actions to move the system to a securer operating point. The procedure is divided into two main stages. The first one consists of estimating the maximum loading point (MLP) and consequently the VSSM, by using nonlinear programming techniques. The second stage consists of computing new directions of load increase. These new directions are based on eigenvector handling. Also, the use of a special load flow method with step size optimization results into a more efficient computation process. Simulation results for IEEE standard and realistic power systems are shown to evaluate the method.","","1-4244-0110-0","10.1109/ICPST.2006.321785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4116416","Power system security;voltage stability;maximum loading point (MLP);nonlinear programming;eigenanalysis","Power system stability;Power system security;Voltage;Power system planning;Power generation;Power system simulation;Computer networks;Reactive power;Information security;Control systems","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;IEEE standards;load flow;nonlinear programming;power system security;power system stability","voltage stability security margins;electrical power systems;maximum loading point;nonlinear programming techniques;eigenvector handling;load flow method;step size optimization;IEEE standard","","2","","15","IEEE","26 Feb 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Annualized indices obtained by considering the load to be constant throughout the year and the annual indices by considering a seven-step load model have been presented. A basic electric power utility objective should be to operate in the normal state with high probability. A system may be capable of operating within constraints but may not be able to withstand outages, even single level. A risk index designated as CSOSR (composite system operating state risk) has been defined and the utilization of this CSOSR for a simple system expansion plan has been demonstrated. It has been shown that composite reinforcement with both generation and transmission gives better results than simple addition of either generation or transmission facilities in the case of the MRBTS. This CSOSR is a new risk index which can be used in a wide variety of system studies.<>","","0-85296-513-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=151821","","Power systems;Reliability","power systems;reliability","power generation;power transmission;composite power system reliability evaluation;security considerations;seven-step load model;high probability;composite system operating state risk","","4","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Therefore simulate the cascading process of power system is more meaningful than a single device contingency analysis. Against such backgrounds, this paper proposes a method for cascading failure simulation with static security analysis method, which considers the load variation during the fault. The method is divided into two steps: firstly, a self-adapting step is figured out with the climbing rate of the daily load curve, and secondly, the power flow at the self-adapting step, which is used to judge if another fault or even the cascading event has happened is calculated. In this way, the process of cascading failure can be simulated and monitored, which is beneficial for the operators to obtain the operating state of the power system in time and adopt appropriate measures to prevent the system from deteriorating into a large-scale blackout accidents. Finally, the standard IEEE 30-bus testing system is adopted to verify the correctness of the method.","2157-4847","978-1-4244-2486-3","10.1109/APPEEC.2009.4918053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4918053","","Power system faults;Power system protection;Analytical models;Failure analysis;Power system simulation;Power system security;Power system analysis computing;Load management;Load flow;Condition monitoring","load flow;load regulation;power system faults;power system reliability;power system security;power system simulation","cascading failure simulation;static security analysis;power system fault;load variation;large-scale blackout accidents;IEEE 30-bus testing system","","3","","16","IEEE","12 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The security assessment of power system is being considered as an important problem in planning, operation and control. Security assessment entails that the system should remain in secure operating state under abnormal conditions. In a power system the Security assessment is carried out by using the voltage performance index (VPI) following a contingency. Contingencies are termed as the uncertain events, occurred due to line outage in the system. VPI can be used for identifying the critical contingency from the perspective of bus voltage violation limits. Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices are having a great impact on the performance of the transmission network. FACTS devices are used for controlling real and reactive power flows and regulating the bus voltages in power systems. Also, FACTS devices raises power transfer capability reduces system losses and improves system stability, because of their fast and flexible control characteristics. Owing to their huge capital cost, it is essential to place these devices optimally in a power system. In this paper, Differential Evolution (DE), a population based stochastic meta-heuristic optimization algorithm is applied for optimal placement of static var compensator (SVC) aimed to the voltage security enhancement of a power system. The SVC placement is considered to be a planning problem and is formulated as a multi-criteria problem comprising of minimization of real power loss, voltage security and investment cost of SVC under single line outage contingencies. Effectiveness of the DE algorithm based approach has been demonstrated on IEEE 30-bus test system.","","978-1-4799-4040-0","10.1109/ICRAIE.2014.6909310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909310","Power system Security;FACTS;SVC;Single line Outage Contingency;Real Power Loss;VPI;Cost of SVC;DE Algorithm","Static VAr compensators;Sociology;Statistics;Reactive power;Indexes","electricity supply industry;flexible AC transmission systems;load flow control;losses;optimisation;performance index;power system security;power system stability;power transmission control;power transmission planning;static VAr compensators;stochastic programming;voltage control","optimal placement;optimal sizing;SVC;voltage security improvement;differential evolution algorithm;restructuring power systems;electric utilities;power system security assessment;power system planning;power system operation;power system control;secure operating state;abnormal conditions;voltage performance index;VPI;line outage;critical contingency identification;bus voltage violation limits;flexible alternating current transmission systems devices;FACTS devices;transmission network;real power flow control;reactive power flow control;bus voltage regulation;power transfer capability;system loss reduction;system stability improvement;capital cost;DE;population based stochastic meta-heuristic optimization algorithm;static var compensator;multicriteria problem;IEEE 30-bus test system;loss minimization","","13","","28","IEEE","25 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we analyze the security guarantees that used to defend against physical attacks, and make the observation that heterogeneous GPU memory system may not always need all the security mechanisms to achieve the security guarantees. Based on the memory types as well as memory access patterns either explicitly specified in the GPU programming model or implicitly detected at run time, we propose adaptive security memory support for heterogeneous memory on GPUs. Specifically, we first identify the read-only data and propose to only use MAC (Message Authentication Code) to protect their integrity. By eliminating the freshness checks on read-only data, we can use an on-chip shared counter for such data regions and remove the corresponding parts in the Bonsai Merkel Tree (BMT), thereby reducing the traffic due to encryption counters and the BMT. Second, we detect the common streaming data access pattern and propose coarse- grain MACs for such stream data to reduce the MAC access bandwidth. With the hardware-based detection of memory type (read-only or not) and memory access patterns (streaming or not), our proposed approach adapts the security support to significantly reduce the performance overhead without sacrificing the security guarantees. Our evaluation shows that our scheme can achieve secure memory on GPUs with low overheads for memory-intensive workloads. Among the fifteen memory-intensive workloads in our evaluation, our design reduces the performance overheads of secure GPU memory from 53.9% to 8.09% on average. Compared to the state-of- the-art secure memory designs for GPU [17], [33], our scheme outperforms PSSM by up to 41.63% and 9.5% on average and outperforms Common counters by 84.04% on average for memory-intensive workloads. We further propose to use the L2 cache as a victim cache for security metadata when the L2 is either underutilized or suffers from very high miss rates, which further reduces the overheads by up to 4% and 0.65% on average.","2378-203X","978-1-6654-2027-3","10.1109/HPCA53966.2022.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773192","GPUs;secure memory;heterogeneous memory;encryption;integrity check;security metadata cache","Graphics processing units;Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Metadata;Programming;Hardware;System-on-chip","cache storage;cryptography;graphics processing units;message authentication;multiprocessing systems","adaptive security support;CPU secure memory design;memory bandwidth contention;regular data;security metadata;security guarantees;heterogeneous GPU memory system;memory access patterns;GPU programming model;adaptive security memory support;read-only data;common streaming data access pattern;stream data;MAC access bandwidth;hardware-based detection;memory-intensive workloads;secure GPU memory;physical attack;message authentication code;on-chip shared counter;Bonsai Merkel Tree;BMT;L2 cache","","4","","34","IEEE","17 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Dynamic Security Assessment of Small-Signal Stability for Power Grids Using Windowed Online Gaussian Process","C. Zhai; H. D. Nguyen; X.

This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for dynamic small-signal stability assessment of power grids by estimating the region of attraction (ROA) for operating states in real time. By analyzing the latest sampling data of power grids in a fixed time window, an up-to-date training set is constructed with the aid of converse Lyapunov function, which enables us to develop an online learning approach based on Gaussian Process (GP) to assess the stability level of power grids. As a result, an iteration algorithm is designed to update the assessment parameters by learning the input-output pairs in the training set. Theoretical analysis is conducted to ensure the existence of converse Lyapunov function for differential-algebraic system that serves to describe power system dynamics, as well as to estimate the region of attraction for operating states with a given confidence level. In particular, a practical method is proposed to leverage time series of phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements including voltage/current magnitude, phase and frequency (i.e., PMU data) of real power grids for validating the online GP approach. Moreover, validations are taken to substantiate the proposed approach by using PMU data of real smart-grid infrastructure and IEEE test cases. The proposed assessment approach contributes to situational awareness of human operators in the control station, thereby taking proactive remedial actions prior to emergencies. Note to Practitioners—This paper was motivated by the problem of online assessment of power systems security but it also applies to other industrial control systems that have stable state trajectories. Existing approaches to security assessment of power systems generally focus on the adoption of various machine-learning algorithms by treating power grid as a “black box,” which ignores the intrinsic characteristics of power systems and thus restricts the inference performance. This paper proposes a new approach using limited sampling data and system dynamics to construct a domain of stability for power grids, which can reflect the evolution of security zones and provide more accurate predictions. In this work, we mathematically characterize the domain of stability for a practical power grid by analyzing and learning its state trajectories. Then we show how the proposed approach can be efficiently implemented online, which can timely alert human operators to abnormalities. Preliminary validations suggest that this approach is feasible and effective. In future research, we will incorporate it into an energy management system and test it in other industrial processes.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2022.3173368","Nanyang Technological University (NTU)(grant numbers:SUG 001500-00001); National Research Foundation and Energy Market Authority (EMA), Singapore(grant numbers:NRF-EMA EMA-EP004-EKJGC-0003,MOE ARF Tier 1 2019-T1-001-119); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773283","Online Gaussian process;region of attraction;power systems stability;security assessment","Power system stability;Power system dynamics;Power grids;Security;Lyapunov methods;Stability criteria;Mathematical models","energy management systems;Gaussian processes;industrial control;learning (artificial intelligence);Lyapunov methods;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power grids;power system measurement;power system security;power system stability;smart power grids;time series","dynamic security assessment;dynamic small-signal stability assessment;electrical power grids;online small-signal stability assessment;power system dynamics;power systems security;practical power grid","","","","34","IEEE","12 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As manpower allocations are reduced, new approaches are necessary to compensate for this loss. In addition, with the shift from superpower confrontation to local/regional conflict, response assets have become highly mobile. This creates a new requirement for the physical protection of those items. In response to these changes, Racon Inc. has successfully commercialized a physical security sensor addressing these issues. Easily installed by unskilled personnel, these sensors utilize advanced technology to compensate for reduced manpower levels.

Security- and safety-critical applications require access control policies that define how these resources interact to ensure that malicious and unsafe behaviors do not occur. Aker is a design and verification framework for on-chip access control. The core of Aker is the access control wrapper (ACW)–a high-performance yet efficient hardware module that dynamically arbitrates on-chip communications. Aker distributes ACWs across the SoC and programs them to perform local access control. Aker provides a firmware generation tool and a property-driven security verification methodology to ensure that the ACWs are properly integrated and configured. Aker security verification confirms that the ACW behaves properly at IP level. It verifies the hardware root of trust firmware configures the ACW correctly. And it evaluates system-level security threats due to interactions between shared resources. Aker is experimentally validated on a Xilinx UltraScale+ programmable SoC.

We have argued that incorporating an explicit representation of the environment's topology enables reasoning on the location of assets being protected and the proximity of potentially harmful agents. This paper proposes to engineer topology aware adaptive security systems by identifying violations of security requirements that may be caused by topological changes, and selecting a set of security controls that prevent such violations. Our approach focuses on physical topologies; it maintains at runtime a live representation of the topology which is updated when assets or agents move, or when the structure of the physical space is altered. When the topology changes, we look ahead at a subset of the future system states. These states are reachable when the agents move within the physical space. If security requirements can be violated in future system states, a configuration of security controls is proactively applied to prevent the system from reaching those states. Thus, the system continuously adapts to topological stimuli, while maintaining requirements satisfaction. Security requirements are formally expressed using a propositional temporal logic, encoding spatial properties in Computation Tree Logic (CTL). The Ambient Calculus is used to represent the topology of the operational environment - including location of assets and agents - as well as to identify future system states that are reachable from the current one. The approach is demonstrated and evaluated using a substantive example concerned with physical access control.","2332-6441","978-1-4799-3033-3","10.1109/RE.2014.6912262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912262","","Security;Topology;Buildings;Calculus;Aerospace electronics;Servers;Runtime","authorisation;data flow analysis;formal specification;temporal logic","topology aware adaptive security engineering;requirements violation prevention;adaptive security systems;potentially harmful agents;security requirements;security controls;propositional temporal logic;encoding spatial properties;computation tree logic;ambient calculus;access control","","21","","24","IEEE","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the previous physically-isolated world, robust static security for selected matched problems was often sufficient. Today, we need a new approach to providing security, because even adaptive security is insufficient. This new approach is termed here a cognitive security system. The talk will cover three major issues. First, the talk starts from a review of the existing security systems, with their problems and required solutions, as well as their vulnerabilities, attacks, and defences. Second, it provides a review of decision-making systems, including dynamic and dynamical systems, complex systems, adaptive systems, autonomic systems and their attributes, symbiotic systems, and finally special attention is given to cognitive dynamic systems as defined by Wang's cognitive informatics [1-4], Kinsner cognitive machines, [5], Haikonen conscious machines [6], and Haykin cognitive dynamic systems [7].

Currently in addition to improvements of single technology, the following system-level technical bottlenecks must be solved to improve the overall performance of social security: 1. Blind spots of perception exist in surveillance area of due to the non-overlap of surveillance sensors, 2. The performance of single identification technology decreases sharply in complex surveillance scenarios such as poor lighting conditions or disguise, 3. Traditional warning technologies become invalid due to the multi-stage non-stationary evolution feature of complex events. Three challenges listed above closely relate to three scientific problems in the analysis technology of big visual data on three levels: sensing data, identification technology and pattern recognition. Our study aims at (1) exploiting the complete mapping mechanism between physical space and multivariate sensing spaces to fill-in the blind spots of sensing data, (2) exploring the correlative mechanism of multi-modal objects in multivariate sensing spaces to improve the analytical performance from single identification technology, (3) studying the spatial-temporal evolution mechanism in the entire lifecycle of complex events to extend pattern recognition from local space and time. The security space is the physical space with comprehensive protective ability, which includes ubiquitous sensing, reliable identification, penetrating trend analysis and approaching danger warning at any time, at any location, for any object and for any behavior. Aiming to build the theory of security space, this study is divided into three levels: information acquisition and perceptional computation, scene analysis and evolution prediction, resource scheduling and system applications. Then it is further divided into five tasks: (1) task 1: visual object recognition and big data based identification, (2) task 2: situational awareness of groups and multi-scale revolution, (3) task 3: semantic analysis of scenes and correlative computation in multivariate spaces, (4) task 4: big scale visual retrieval and security risk analysis, (5) task 5: Warning system of the security space and its applications. Task 1 corresponds to the first level because sensing and identification of objects is the basis for analysis. Task 2 and 3 correspond to the second level since group behavior, events, scene and their evolution are crucial for the prediction and warning of security events. Task 4 and 5 correspond to the third level of this study in order to develop the high performance computing platform, to conduct system evaluation and application demonstration. Big visual data contains massive high-dimensional sensing data, implying the complicated relationship among social objects. In fact, in the world of data, the spatial-temporal relationship between the big data objects is more essential than the causal relationship, and these private and implicit relationships compose the core values of the big data social analysis. Only the analysis of individuals, groups and scenes in big visual data are based on the core element of social security analysis, that is"" social structure and social activities"", can it supports the strategic transference of urban security system from investigation afterwards to warning in advance. The overall purpose of this study is to build the big data analysis system in security space, realizing the intelligent big visual data system which supports data analysis of hundred billions of feature data, billions of image data, millions of visual sensing terminals. The expected achievements on the warning and protection system for large spaces can reach the international leading level. Based on the achievements above, the project plans to develop 10 intelligent big data analysis products of 3 categories, and the expected benefits of industrialization promotion can reach 100 billion, which promotes the upstream and downstream industry to realize economic benefits 3 billion. Also we strive to become the internationally leading industry in the field of big security data analysis.","","978-1-5090-3677-6","10.1109/CBD.2016.065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7815231","big visual data;security space;social security","Security;Sensors;Visualization;Big data;Object recognition;Surveillance;Data analysis","Big Data;biometrics (access control);data analysis;data visualisation;pattern recognition;risk analysis;security of data;surveillance;ubiquitous computing","warning system;security risk analysis;big scale visual retrieval;semantic analysis;Big Data based identification;visual object recognition;system applications;resource scheduling;evolution prediction;scene analysis;perceptional computation;information acquisition;trend analysis penetration;reliable identification;ubiquitous sensing;pattern recognition;sensing data;social security;biometric identification technology;surveillance;seeing;security space;Big visual data analysis;key technology","","3","","","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional anomaly detection methods usually find low-probability events with a learned a probability distribution model, or evaluate the testing samples with the local density of the testing samples. Multi-state system usually has multiple normal states, and state changes at unpredictable points caused by the daily operation such as feed, outlet, flow control, etc. For the multistate system, collecting enough data that contain all possible states are challenging or impossible to users. Furthermore, conventional anomaly detection methods are sensitive to the context of training datasets or the unpredicted phased changes of the testing datasets, or just consider the local density of the testing samples. Motivated by this problem, we transform the model learning problem to a distinction learning problem that learns the familiarity of each testing samples. In order to reduce the effects of the phased changes, we randomly shuffle the testing dataset and use a sliding window to evaluate the familiarity of the testing samples with one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. Our contributions include: (1) reducing the requirement of the prior knowledge; (2) handling the phased changes of the testing datasets, (3) considering the global familiarity of the testing samples.

To deal with the input saturation problem, an auxiliary system is designed. Then, adaptive controllers are designed by applying the backstepping method for the master and the slave, respectively.

Although an increasing number of secure storage systems have been developed, there is no way to dynamically choose security services to meet disk requests' flexible security requirements. Furthermore, existing security techniques for disk systems are not suitable to guarantee desired response times of disk requests. We remedy this situation by proposing an adaptive scheme (referred to as AdSeD) that can judiciously select the most appropriate security service for each write request while endeavouring to guarantee the desired response times of all disk requests. Experimental results show that AdSeD significantly improves security and overall performance over an existing scheme by up an average of 199.5% and 213.4%.","","978-0-7695-3193-9","10.1109/CSE.2008.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4578261","storage systems;security level;satisfied ratio","","disc storage;security of data","AdSeD;adaptive security control quality;disk systems;modern storage systems","","","","37","IEEE","25 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the use of reasonable spare inventory strategy, as well as maintenance and support decisions to systems is essential to improve system availability, security and system cost reducing. Maintenance strategy can be formulated based on the situation in which the products are monitored. For a single-component system, current research around its multi-state transferring have been quite mature, in which the conversion rate defined in a different state in Markov process can be clearly showed by conversion relationship between different state. However, the state transition process involved mostly considers the processes of repairing only, and rarely considers the impact to system availability by the transition of failure rate caused by changes in components, spare replacement strategies and spare supply. To solve this problem, this paper considered a single-component system with two derating states, and discussed its steady-state availability through variable spare replacement probability and different spare fill rate levels. With model of the system with two derating states established, generalized Markov method was used to solve the relationships between replacement timing and system availability with the level of spare fill rate considered. Finally, through the analysis of results, the preliminary conclusions were obtained. The results could clearly reveal the impacts of spare replacement strategy and spare fill rate in single-component system.","2166-5656","978-1-4799-7958-5","10.1109/PHM.2014.6988248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6988248","single-component;multi-states;replacment stategy;degradation system;system availability","Availability;Maintenance engineering;Steady-state;Markov processes;Equations;Mathematical model;Reliability engineering","cost reduction;inventory management;maintenance engineering;Markov processes","optimal replacement strategy;degradation system component;system availability;support process;equipment system;spare inventory strategy;turnaround time;product maintenance strategy;system support time;support decision;security;system cost reduction;single-component system;multistate transferring;Markov process;conversion relationship;state transition process;failure rate;spare replacement strategy;spare supply;steady-state availability;spare replacement probability;spare fill rate level;derating states;generalized Markov method;replacement timing","","","","8","IEEE","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we explore the use of Bigraphical Reactive Systems to model the topology of cyber and physical spaces and their dynamics. We utilise such models to perform speculative threat analysis through model checking to reason about the consequences of the evolution of topological configurations on the satisfaction of security requirements.

In this paper, we propose a new denial of service (DoS) attack strategy where the attackers leverage learning capabilities of convolutional neural networks in the encrypted domain to forecast the optimal time of launching a DoS attack. In our simulations Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is used to secure communication channels between phasor measurement units, phasor data concentrators, and the regional/national control center. It is illustrated that, despite providing confidential communication channels by IPsec-based security gateways, an attacker still can estimate the future operating state of the power system in advance. This gives an opportunity to the attackers for initiating an effective DoS attack. The proposed method is validated by the simulation results, which show a significant increase in the success rate of DoS attacks.","","978-1-6654-8032-1","10.1109/ISGT-Europe54678.2022.9960467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9960467","cyber-physical systems;encrypted data classification;denial of service attack;power system blackout;wide area monitoring system","Protocols;Power system protection;Communication channels;Power system stability;Feature extraction;Phasor measurement units;Data models","computer network security;convolutional neural nets;cyber-physical systems;deep learning (artificial intelligence);Internet;IP networks;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power system measurement;power system security;protocols;telecommunication computing","cascading failure;confidential communication channels;convolutional neural networks;deep learning-based strategy;denial of service attack;effective DoS attack;Internet protocol security;IPsec-based security gateways;leverage learning capabilities;malicious attacks;national control center;phasor data concentrators;phasor measurement units;PMU-based cyber-physical power systems;regional control center;service attack strategy;system vulnerabilities;widespread blackout","","","","12","IEEE","28 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, this paper presents an approach to evaluate the impacts of the HVDC link outage on the reliability of interconnected power system considering the frequency regulation process during system contingencies. Firstly, a multi-state model of an HVDC link with different available loading rates (ALRs) is established based on its reliability network. Then, dynamic frequency response models of the inter- connected power system are presented and integrated with a novel frequency regulation scheme enabled by the HVDC link. The proposed scheme exploits the temporary overload capability of normal converters to compensate for the imbalanced power during system contingencies. Moreover, it offers frequency support that enables the frequency regulation reserves of the sending-end and receiving-end power systems to be mutually available. Several indices are established to measure the system reliability based on the given models in terms of abnormal frequency duration, frequency deviation, and energy losses of the frequency regulation process during system contingencies. Finally, a modified two-area reliability test system (RTS) with an HVDC link is adopted to verify the proposed approach.","2196-5420","","10.35833/MPCE.2021.000491","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51807173); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9682650","Reliability;multi-state modeling;interconnected power system;high-voltage direct current (HVDC) link;frequency regulation","HVDC transmission;Reliability;Power system reliability;Frequency control;Power systems;Power system stability;Maintenance engineering","frequency control;frequency response;HVDC power convertors;HVDC power transmission;power generation control;power grids;power system interconnection;power system security;reliability","abnormal frequency duration;dynamic frequency response models;frequency deviation;frequency regulation reserves;frequency regulation scheme;frequency security;frequency support;high-voltage direct current;HVDC link outage;HVDC links considering frequency regulation process;imbalanced power;interconnected power system;receiving-end power systems;reliability assessment;reliability network;reliability performances;system contingencies;system reliability;two-area reliability test system","","","","30","","14 Jan 2022","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Most secure routing schemes found in the literature provision security at the highest level by involving sophisticated data encryption with a large key. This imposes lots of overhead both in computation, while performing the encryption and decryption, and in communication due to bit padding. The proposed optimization approach strives to adapt the security measures to the trust level on the nodes on the path and factors in the security-related overhead in the link cost. In addition, a novel path rotation scheme is proposed to enable the use of resource-efficient security measures without risking an increase in vulnerability. The applicability of the proposed optimization is validated using the ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector (AOMDV) routing protocol and its performance advantage is confirmed via ns2 simulation experiments.","0742-1303","978-1-4244-4488-5","10.1109/LCN.2009.5355022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5355022","","Energy efficiency;Wireless sensor networks;Cryptography;Data security;Application specific processors;Communication system security;USA Councils;Rotation measurement;Routing protocols;Costs","cryptography;optimisation;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor networks;adaptive security provision;energy efficiency;optimization strategy;data routing;decryption;security-related overhead;ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector routing protocol;resource efficiency;security of data;data encryption;bit padding;path rotation scheme;AOMDV routing protocol;ns2 simulation","","9","","28","IEEE","18 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These architectural configuration changes have affect on the overall system quality attributes (i.e. performance, security and reliability). Therefore, modelling SoS architecture is a challenging task as CSs and the possible architectural configurations are not entirely known at design time. Architectural description languages (ADLs) have been proposed and used to deal with SoS dynamic architecture. However, we still envision gaps to be bridged and challenges to be addressed in the forthcoming years. This paper outline a taxonomy for modeling SoS and provides a broad discussion on the state-of-the-art modeling notations to model and analyze SoS architectural configuration.

This interconnectivity enables new functionality but also new attack vectors.Today, agencies mostly rely on commercial security solutions providing adequate protection for commercial data services but have deficiencies when it comes to the Air Traffic Management (ATM) environment with its requirement for highest resilience, multi-level redundancies, and dynamic environment.This paper introduces a novel approach to create an ATM-grade baseline integrating operational security events (OSE) and alerts (OSA) based on abnormal or malicious network traffic. An assured and trusted baseline is key to detecting atypical or malicious traffic. A testbed has been developed that models the regular ATM-grade IP-network behavior. The sample configuration uses open source stacks ElastiFlow, and SELKS to provide network flow data collection and visualization and demonstrate resilience against hacking attempts via unauthorized communication and protocols between nodes, unauthorized configuration changes via distribution of parameters to network nodes, as well as detection of malicious communication attempts from unauthorized devices on the network. A Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture is chosen as it features a programmable, efficient network configuration improving network performance and monitoring. The OpenFlow protocol is used to provide the control plane in the testbed. Data flows will be modeled as synchronous as well as asynchronous. Vulnerabilities are then identified, attack scenarios defined and applied to the testbed setup. The available SDN platform tools are then used to detect the anomalies. Sets of experiments are performed and the results compared and discussed.","2155-4951","978-1-6654-3584-0","10.1109/ICNS52807.2021.9441630","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9441630","","Protocols;Navigation;Telecommunication traffic;Machine learning;FAA;Traffic control;Tools","air traffic control;aircraft navigation;authorisation;computer network performance evaluation;computer network security;data visualisation;IP networks;protocols;redundancy;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","OpenFlow protocols;unauthorized configuration changes;network nodes;malicious communication attempts;unauthorized devices;software defined network architecture;programmable network configuration;efficient network configuration;network performance improvement;anomaly detection;Federal Aviation Administration;air navigation service providers;data service consumers;interconnectivity;attack vectors;commercial security solutions;commercial data services;air traffic management environment;multilevel redundancies;dynamic environment;ATM-grade baseline;operational security events;abnormal network traffic;malicious network traffic;atypical traffic;regular ATM-grade IP-network behavior;sample configuration;open source stacks;network flow data collection;data visualization;hacking attempts;unauthorized communication;ElastiFlow;ATM-grade software defined networks;Air Navigation Service Providers;operational security alerts;SELKS;network monitoring","","","","12","IEEE","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed system combines real-time scheduling with security service enhancement. The scheduling unit uses the differentiated-earliest-deadline-first (Diff-EDF) scheduler and the security enhancement scheme adopts a congestion control mechanism. The required QoS is guaranteed for different types (audio and video) of real-time data flows, while the packet security levels are adaptively enhanced according to the feedbacks from the congestion control module. Compared with the IPsec protocol, the proposed scheme reduces the number of pending packets at the destinations. In implementation, the proposed scheme can overload the priority code point and the virtual-LAN identifier fields of the IEEE 802.1Q frame format, hence eliminating the overhead of the security associations performed by the IPsec protocol.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2013.071813.120299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6565569","Multi-agent systems;quality of service (QoS);real-time scheduling;network security;resource estimation","Quality of service;Real-time systems;Scheduling;Multi-agent systems;Authentication;Packet switching","computer network security;local area networks;multi-agent systems;quality of service;real-time systems;scheduling;telecommunication congestion control","real-time scheduling;packet switched networks;real-time network applications;quality of service;timing constraints;security requirements;adaptive security-aware scheduling system;real-time multiagent design model;security service enhancement;differentiated-earliest-deadline-first scheduler;Diff-EDF scheduler;congestion control mechanism;packet security levels;pending packets;priority code point;virtual-LAN identifier fields;IEEE 802.1Q frame format","","12","","43","IEEE","23 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Remote access to IEDs or user interfaces in a substation for maintenance purposes is a common practice. However, there are potential cyber-physical system vulnerabilities in a substation, e.g., unsecured standard protocols, remote controllable IEDs, and unauthorized remote access to substation IEDs. In addition, some substation IEDs and user interfaces have a web server and hence it may provide a remote configuration change and control with default passwords. Even if firewalls and cryptography schemes are used for cyber security, weak security key management cryptography and mis-configured firewalls are still exposed to intruders. From IT point of view, cyber security issues are well known and new security technologies are available. However, security research on the integration of IT and physical power systems for critical infrastructures is still an emerging area. Intruders behaviors will generate logs across all substation-level networks, e.g., IEDs, firewalls and user interfaces. For instance, the steps of Stuxnet attack are based on: (1) intrusion attempts, (2) change of the file system, (3) change of target systems setting, and (4) change of target systems status. Therefore, anomaly detection is performed based on logs of intruders foot prints. Temporal anomaly can be determined from discrepancies between event logs from two different time periods. In the proposed anomaly index, a value of 0 implies no difference, whereas 1 indicates the maximal discrepancy [1]. In order to identify the impact of substation cyber intrusion to the power grid, cyber intrusion scenarios have been conducted on the substation IT network using a SCADA testbed at University College Dublin (UCD). The first intrusion scenario involves compromised substation gateway. A false signal is generated and an open circuit breaker (CB) command is sent to substation CBs. The second scenario is to generate forged CB status at the gateway. As a result of this attack, control center operators will observe fake data about the CB status. However, the actual substation CBs status has not changed. The third scenario is to generate fabricated analogue values to a control center using a man-in-the-middle attack. Once an intruder successfully compromises the substation LAN, (s)he is able to monitor and capture all measured data which comes from power grids. If attackers send fabricated data to the control center and the data travel through the state estimation filter, control center operators will observe an operational emergency. As a result, the operators may take emergency control actions such as reducing the generation voltage or reactive power while the power system is actually in a normal condition. There is a possibility these (logical) actions based on fabricated data will drive the system into a sequence of cascading events, leading to a power outage. Mitigation actions are conducted on substation IT and power grid. For IT mitigation, intrusion detection system (IDS) which uses anomaly detection algorithm based on temporal event construction has been used in a substation network. An Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm with an objective function that minimizes load shedding in the grid is used for power system mitigation. The proposed collaboration scheme between IDS and the firewall is able to disconnect intruders in the substation network. Emergency control actions are taken to mitigate the effects of cyber intrusions as an attempt to restore a system back to a normal condition.","1944-9925","978-1-4673-2729-9","10.1109/PESGM.2012.6345766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345766","","Substations;Educational institutions;Circuit breakers;User interfaces;Computer security","cryptography;firewalls;Internet;load shedding;microprocessor chips;power grids;power system security;SCADA systems;substations;transport protocols;user interfaces;wide area networks","cyberphysical security;microprocessor based intelligent electronic devices;standardized protocol;TCP/IP;wide area networks;user interfaces;remote access;Web server;remote configuration;firewalls;key management cryptography;Stuxnet attack;intrusion attempts;anomaly detection;intruders foot prints;substation cyber intrusion;SCADA;substation gateway;open circuit breaker command;control center operators;man-in-the-middle attack;power grids;state estimation filter;IT mitigation;intrusion detection system;optimal power flow algorithm;objective function;load shedding;power system mitigation;emergency control","","2","","1","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Those criteria are experience, skill and knowledge; teams workload; development team size; development timeline; and cost/budget. Therefore, the selection of security activities must be based on the priority of the criteria and adaptive. This paper addresses the adaptive security activities selection model as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) issue. Analytic Network Process (ANP) is proposed for weight calculation and criteria prioritization. Hypothetical examples were presented based on hard constraints faced by in-house web-based application development team in two different scenarios. The Decision Maker made the judgement by using the online ASAS model. The results show that experience, skill and knowledge get the highest priority in the first scenario while budget/ cost get the highest priority in the second scenario.

Combining information flow and risk analyses could make fault-mode evaluations for such devices more efficient and cost-effective. Conducting high-grade information security evaluations for computer communications devices is intellectually challenging, time-consuming, costly, and error prone. We believe that our structured approach can reveal potential fault modes because it simplifies evaluating a device's logical design and physical construction. By combining information-flow and risk-analysis techniques, evaluators can use the process to produce a thorough and transparent security argument. In other work, we have applied static analysis techniques to the evaluation problem, treating a device's schematic circuitry diagram as an information flow graph. This work shows how to trace information flow in different operating modes by representing connectivity between components as being conditional on specific device states. We have also developed a way to define the security-critical region of components with particular security significance by identifying components that lie on a path from a high-security data source to a low-security sink. Finally, to make these concepts practical, we have implemented them in an interactive analysis tool that reads schematic diagrams written in the very high speed integrated circuit (VHSIC) hardware description language.","1558-0814","","10.1109/MC.2006.161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631944","Security and protection;Data communications devices;Computer applications-military;Communications","Circuit faults;Information security;Military computing;Very high speed integrated circuits;Government;Military communication;Application software;Electronic components;Risk analysis;Computer errors","safety-critical software;fault diagnosis;hardware description languages;integrated circuit layout","fault-mode evaluation;security-critical communication devices;information security evaluation;risk-analysis techniques;transparent security argument;static analysis techniques;schematic circuitry diagram;information flow graph;very high speed integrated circuit;VHSIC;hardware description language","","6","","12","IEEE","15 May 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This paper reports the way in which a cyber attack can be performed to corrupt an available set of measurements associated with the operation of electronic-based controllers, namely the thyristor-controlled series compensator (TCSC) and static VAR compensator with a transformer (SVC-T), which jeopardizes the controller's secure operation if a control action is performed based on this false estimation of the operating state.

As the key enabler of a smart grid, numerous sensors such as PMU and current sensors transmit real-time dynamic data, which is usually protected by encryption algorithm from malicious attacks, over wide-area-network (WAN) to power system control centers so that monitoring and control of the whole system is possible.

This paper identifies numerous factors that govern the formation of situation awareness in a power system control center. A multi-state model based on Markov modeling is proposed for assessing the impact of insufficient situation awareness on the probability of power system blackouts.

In the proposed approach, the analysis starts by identifying the critical consequences. Then the critical contingencies and operating states, and which external threats and causes that may result in such severe consequences, are identified. This is opposed to the traditional risk and vulnerability analysis which starts by analyzing threats and what can happen as a chain of events.

The power deficit usually results after generator outage or failure of the other means of ensuring the operational reserve. RR consists of rapid start-up generating units such as gas turbines and hydro plants. Due to the stochastic nature of the power system operation, the amount of ready reserve is essential for balancing the power system operating states in perturbed conditions. For that purpose, an ANN using back-propagation learning rule could yield the amount of ready reserve. Prompt assessment of the appropriate amount of RR minimizes the potential reduction of quality of electrical energy delivered to customers and, consequently, maintains a high reliability of the power system as a whole.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.801944","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=801944","","Power generation;Power system security;Power system interconnection;Power system reliability;Power system stability;Power systems;Hydraulic turbines;Spinning;Character generation;Thermal management","power system reliability;power system analysis computing;neural nets;backpropagation;compensation","on-line determination;ready reserve power;artificial neural network;power deficit compensation;power systems;generator outage;rapid start-up generating units;gas turbines;hydro plants;stochastic nature;power system operation;power system operating states balancing;perturbed conditions;back-propagation learning rule;electrical energy quality reduction;high reliability;spinning reserve;stochastic-deterministic model","","15","","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, the upper level problem is the market clearing model of DPPT, while the lower level problem is the operating constraint-based security check model. Furthermore, in order to solve the bi-level optimization problem efficiently, an iterative algorithm is proposed.

The DACS scheme performs the network services efficiently through the communication management of a client. As the characteristic of DACS scheme, only the setup modification is required by a system administrator, when the configuration change is needed in the network server. Then, the setup modification is unnecessary by a customer, which shows a merit for both a system administrator and a customer.

For relation extraction of Chinese internet financial intelligence, the existing models are all based on single-modal text semantics ignoring the role of Chinese pictographic semantics, while the shape and structure of Chinese characters contains useful semantics. In addition, the pictographic semantic fusion method of Chinese text also needs to be improved for better performance. To solve these shortcomings, we propose a Chinese Multimodal Relation Extraction model (CMRE), which improves the relation extraction ability on the Chinese internet financial intelligence. In CMRE, we extract pictographic semantics based on Chinese character shape and structure. Furthermore, we design a novel multi-modal semantic fusion module based on improved Transformer to effectively fuse the text and pictographic semantics. Additionally, we design experiments on the Chinese literature dataset(Sanwen) to test the relation extraction capability of CMRE.

This growth has made the present day systems very big and complex. The complexity is arising especially due to many Interconnections, different types of loads and larger generating units. Also there is uncertainty in load forecasting. With EHV interconnections the disturbances are felt even in geographically distant parts of the system, increasing the severity of the disturbances. These factors make the satisfactory operating of the system a more difficult task. Added to this, Society is becoming more dependent on electric power; and it is essential to make the power available to customers without any interruption and within certain limits of voltage and frequency variations. This means that there is a great need to ensure that a system is as economical, reliable and secure as possible [1]. High reliability of the system is usually obtained by following the principles of bulk power supply planning. However, due to delay in commissioning of new plants and equipment, equipment outages, unexpected load demands and disturbances, the system may be forced to operate in or close to critical and emergency conditions. Hence, in addition to sophisticated planning and designing of the system, an effective operation and control of power systems is essential. The maintenance of a system in a reliable and secure mode is becoming an Important part of the Job of the operators. In the past, more emphasis was given to economic operation; but in view of the consequences of power failures, reliable and secure operation of the system is being given more importance. Security assessment deals with the tracking of the system and deciding whether the present state is secure or not. If the system's state is found to be insecure, it forewarns the operator to take possible remedial action or to be ready for the disturbance if it takes place. This is done before any disturbance (which may lead to failure or deterioration in the quality of supply) occurS. Thus security evaluation is essentially an on-line procedure. The paper will discuss the different operating states of a power system, system security and different approaches for transient security assessment. Recent research results applying the pattern recognition approach will be summarized and presented.","","","10.1109/CDC.1975.270572","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4045489","","Power system security;Pattern recognition;Power system reliability;Power system interconnection;Power system planning;Power system economics;Power generation economics;Economic forecasting;Power system control;Power system transients","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Interfaces for communication with the vehicle, such as WiFi and 5G, enable seamless integration into the user's life, but also cyber attacks on the vehicle. Therefore, research is working on in-vehicle countermeasures such as authentication, access controls, or intrusion detection. Recently, legal regulations have also become effective that require automobile manufacturers to set up a monitoring system for fleet-wide security analysis. The growing amount of software, networking, and the automation of driving create new challenges for security. Context-awareness, situational understanding, adaptive security, and threat intelligence are necessary to cope with these ever-increasing risks. In-vehicle security should be adaptive to secure the car in an infinite number of (driving) situations. For fleet-wide analysis and alert triage, knowledge and understanding of the circumstances are required. Context-awareness, nonetheless, has been sparsely considered in the field of vehicle security. This work aims to be a precursor to context-aware, adaptive and intelligent security for vehicles and fleets. To this end, we provide a comprehensive literature review that analyzes the vehicular as well as related domains. Our survey is mainly characterized by the detailed analysis of the context information that is relevant for vehicle security in the future.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9483907","Automotive engineering;context awareness;context modeling;fleet security;intelligent vehicles;security;situation awareness;threat intelligence;vehicles","Security;Automotive engineering;Monitoring;Industries;Access control;Switches;Encryption","automobiles;intelligent transportation systems;security of data;ubiquitous computing","context-aware security;in-vehicle countermeasures;fleet-wide security analysis;context-awareness;adaptive security;threat intelligence;in-vehicle security;intelligent security;context information","","4","","170","CCBY","14 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Isolation of tenants is essential for a stable and secure operation of a factory. Application upgrades and novel software enable faster innovation cycles. Secure remote management allows more outsourcing to third parties but leads to continuously changing factory networks. Mobile or even autonomous devices again add complexity. However, current factory owners are conservative for good reasons: changing a well-designed system is costly and may cause failures and outages of the production lines. The virtual tenant network (VTN) concept addresses this conflict by means of combining network virtualization, hardware virtualization, cloud technologies and IT automation. Thus, tenants are isolated and configuration changes or security breaches in one tenant will not affect others. The concept at hand borrows from data center technology but adopts those ideas to the embedded world of industrial networks.","","978-1-7281-0568-0","10.1109/NetSys.2019.8854508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8854508","virtual tenant network;edge-cloud;multi-tenant;industrial communication","Production facilities;Couplings;Cloud computing;Quality of service;Security;Stakeholders;Virtualization","cloud computing;computer centres;factory automation;mobile computing;virtualisation","stable operation;secure operation;application upgrades;secure remote management;factory networks;network virtualization;configuration changes;security breaches;multitenant networks;automation industry;future industrial networks;innovation cycles;autonomous devices;virtual tenant network concept","","","","12","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In distributed real-time embedded applications, e.g., electric grid management and command and control applications, it is required to not only meet real-time constraints but also support the data confidentiality,integrity, and authenticity. Unfortunately, in general, cryptographic functions are computationally expensive, possibly causing deadline misses in real-time embedded systems with limited resources. As a basis for cost-effective security support in real-time embedded systems, we define a quantitative notion of Strength of Defense (SoD). Based on the SoD concept, we propose a novel adaptive security policy in which the SoD can be degraded by decreasing the cryptographic key length for certain tasks, if necessary, to improve the success ratio under overload conditions. Our approach is lightweight. The time complexity of our approach is linear and its amortized version has the constant overhead per SoD adaptation period. Moreover, our approach supports desirable security features requiring an attacker to do extra work to find the cryptographic key. In the performance evaluation, we show that our approach can considerably improve the success ratio due to controlled SoD degradation under overload.","2325-1301","0-7695-2676-4","10.1109/RTCSA.2006.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1691312","","Real time systems;Embedded system;Cryptography;Embedded computing;Degradation;Power system security;Computer science;Application software;Control systems;Intelligent networks","computational complexity;cryptography;data integrity;embedded systems;message authentication;scheduling","distributed real-time embedded system;data confidentiality;data integrity;data authenticity;cryptographic key;cost-effective adaptive security policy;strength of defense concept;time complexity","","5","1","22","IEEE","11 Sep 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, in the proposed architecture, all generators in the MG operate as either voltage regulators (active agents), or current sources (passive agents), with their operating mode being determined by software-defined MG control supported by the control plane communication performed over the power bus. For the purpose of control plane communication, we adopt power talk, a modem-less, low-rate, and power-line communication solution designed for direct current MGs.

In this paper, the Benders' Decomposition technique has been applied by decomposing the problem into two parts: the master problem; and the subproblems. The master problem which is the unit commitment problem contains integer variables as the on-off status of the generating units, and therefore could be solved as Mixed-Integer Programming problem. The branch-and-cut method has been chosen to solve the master mixed-integer problem. There are two subproblems considered in this research: the power flow mismatch equations; and the operating limits of power systems. If the conditions in any subproblems are violated, the Benders Cuts corresponding to the violated constraints are added to the master problem and the mixed-integer unit commitment problem could be resolved. The proposed algorithm is tested on the IEEE 57-bus system with 7 thermal generating units. The 24-hour load data is made available along with the additional data for generating units. The results of typical unit commitment, security-constrained unit commitment under normal operating states and SCUC with contingency states are compared. The results show that the total generating costs of SCUC with contingency are higher than the others. However the committed units of that SCUC ensure that the system could still serve load when contingency occurs.","","978-1-4244-5607-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5491412","","Power generation;Load flow;Mathematical model;Power engineering and energy;Equations;System testing;Power system simulation;Power system planning;Cost function;Power systems","integer programming;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power generation scheduling;power system security","security-constrained unit commitment;mixed-integer programming;Benders decomposition;integer variables;branch-and-cut method;power flow mismatch equation;IEEE 57-bus system;generation units","","1","","11","","24 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We exploit the innovative idea of Public Physical Unclonable Functions (PPUFs) that fundamentally protects attackers from recovering the secret key from public gate delay information. We implement its hardware logic in a real-world FPGA board. On top of the PPUF fingerprint hardware, we present an adaptive security control mechanism consisting of adaptive key generation and key exchange protocol, which adjusts security strength depending on system load dynamics. We demonstrate that our PPUF FPGA implementation embeds distinctive variability enough to distinguish between two different PPUFs with high fidelity. We validate our PUFSec architecture by implementing necessary algorithms and protocols in a real-world IoT platform, and performing empirical evaluation in terms of computation and memory usages, proving its practical feasibility.","","978-1-5090-5336-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057146","","Hardware;Logic gates;Delays;Cryptography;Software;Radiation detectors","cryptographic protocols;embedded systems;field programmable gate arrays;Internet of Things;private key cryptography;public key cryptography;telecommunication security","low-end embedded platform;security enhancement;computation overhead;IoT devices;intrinsic hardware characteristics;computationally lightweight security software system architecture;complex cryptography computation;Public Physical Unclonable Functions;secret key;public gate delay information;hardware logic;real-world FPGA board;PPUF fingerprint hardware;adaptive security control mechanism;adaptive key generation;key exchange protocol;security strength;system load dynamics;PPUF FPGA implementation;PUFSec architecture;real-world IoT platform;device fingerprint-based security architecture;Internet of Things","","9","","13","IEEE","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of its most valuable features is its threat detection function which is available on every version of the firewall running a software version of 8.0(2) or higher. Threat detection operates at layers 3 and 4 to determine a baseline for network traffic, analysing packet drop statistics and generating threat reports based on traffic patterns. Despite producing a large volume of statistical information relating to several security events, further effort is required to mine and visually report more significant information and conclude the security status of the network. There are several commercial off-the-shelf tools available to undertake this task, however, they are expensive and may require a cloud subscription. Furthermore, if the information transmitted over the network is sensitive or requires confidentiality, the involvement of a third party or a third-party tool may place organisational security at risk. Therefore, this paper presents a fuzzy logic aided intelligent threat detection solution, which is a cost-free, intuitive and comprehensible solution, enhancing and simplifying the threat detection process for all. In particular, it employs a fuzzy reasoning system based on the threat detection statistics, and presents results/threats through a developed dashboard user interface, for ease of understanding for administrators and users. The paper further demonstrates the successful utilisation of a fuzzy reasoning system for selected and prioritised security events in basic threat detection, although it can be extended to encompass more complex situations, such as complete basic threat detection, advanced threat detection, scanning threat detection, and customised feature based threat detection.","","978-1-5090-6020-7","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2018.8491574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491574","","Firewalls (computing);Feature extraction;Fuzzy logic;Tools;Monitoring;Fuzzy reasoning","computer crime;firewalls;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;organisational aspects;user interfaces","organisational networks;valuable features;threat detection function;software version;network traffic;analysing packet drop statistics;traffic patterns;statistical information;significant information;security status;third-party tool;organisational security;fuzzy logic;intelligent threat detection solution;comprehensible solution;threat detection process;fuzzy reasoning system;threat detection statistics;prioritised security events;complete basic threat detection;advanced threat detection;customised feature based threat detection;Cisco adaptive security appliance 5500 series firewall","","15","","28","Crown","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, failures of any network component, such as a transmission line or power generator, can be critical to the overall grid operation. The security constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) aims for the long term precontingency operating state, such that in the event of any contingency, the power grid will remain secure. For a realistic power network, however, with numerous contingencies considered, the overall problem size becomes intractable for single-core optimization tools in short time frames established by real-time industrial operations. We propose a parallel distributed memory structure exploiting framework, BELTISTOS-SC, which accelerates the solution of SCOPF problems over state of the art techniques. The acceleration on single-core execution is achieved by a structure-exploiting interior point method, employing successive Schur complement evaluations to further reduce the size of the systems solved at each iteration while maintaining sparsity, resulting in lower computational resources for the linear system solution. Additionally the parallel, distributed memory implementation of the proposed framework is also presented in detail and validated through several large-scale examples, demonstrating its efficiency for large-scale SCOPF problems.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2942964","Swiss Innovation Agency; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8846109","Security constraints;optimal power flow;non-linear programming;interior point method;parallel algorithms","Generators;Security;Power transmission lines;Optimization;Power grids;Acceleration;Linear programming","distributed memory systems;iterative methods;load flow;optimisation;power engineering computing;power grids;power system security;renewable energy sources","single-core optimization tools;real-time industrial operations;parallel distributed memory structure exploiting framework;linear system solution;large-scale SCOPF problems;security constrained optimal power flow problems;renewable energy;power grid equipment;transmission line;power generator;long term precontingency operating state;realistic power network;two level parallel augmented Schur complement interior-point algorithms;BELTISTOS-SC;iteration method","","15","","34","IEEE","23 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As an ideal unconditional secure technique, OTP requires the key rate the same as the information rate. However, comparing with high speed information traffic (Gbps), the key generation rate of QKD is very poor(Kbps). Therefore, in practical QKD networks, it is difficult to support numerous applications and multiple users simultaneously. To address this issue, we argue that it is more practical to provide quality of security instead of OTP in quantum networks. We further propose ASM, an Adaptive Security Selection Mechanism for quantum networks based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). In ASM, services can select an appropriate encryption algorithm that satisfies the proper security level and performance metrics under the limit of the key generation rate.

However, manipulation of logistics data (e.g. showing availability of bikes or parking where none may exist) and mobility operations (e.g. unauthorized tampering with service-related data) may disrupt the whole service.

The video coding community considers this problem in the context of transcoding media streams, but their approaches either fail to address authentication or fail to provide meaningful security guarantees. We present two provably-secure schemes, LISSA and TRESSA, that allow an intelligent network intermediary to intercept a stream signed by a content provider, and adapt it dynamically, while preserving the ultimate receiver's ability to securely verify the content provider's signature (and, hence, authenticity and integrity of the data received). Our schemes allow the intermediary to selectively remove portions of the stream and, thus, permit common media transcoding techniques such as scalable compression and multiple file switching. Moreover, a content provider only has to encode and sign its entire data stream once, as opposed to nondynamically encoding and signing different versions for each anticipated combination of device, network configuration, and channel condition.

The method, suitable for real-time applications, is demonstrated using the Slovenian power-system model for first-swing stability issues. The presented demonstration is segmented into a few parts. First, a database containing a set of pre-fault operating conditions (represented by a measurement matrix) and critical clearing times corresponding to several contingencies is constructed. Measurements matrix from the database is decomposed using the principal component analysis method and represented in a coordinate system defined by the principal components as dense clusters of points. Consequentially, monitoring real-time steady-state conditions in terms of seeking similarity to existing database clusters is facilitated (global screening). This is established by identifying the shortest Euclidean distance metric in the mentioned coordinate system. Finally, a second-stage (local) screening is applied in order to adaptively account for the fluctuating sensitivity of contingencies to variations in pre-fault operating conditions. In this manner, an accurate indication of each contingency impact is provided rapidly as long as a similar operating state exists within the database. Otherwise, the case is thoroughly investigated and added to the database as a new entry. This approach is applicable to a wide spectrum of dynamic problems, considering that problem-relevant sets of input data are available.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2019.2919652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8723513","Adaptive;contingency;database;data mining;power-system stability;principal component;screening","Databases;Power system stability;Principal component analysis;Real-time systems;Matrix decomposition;Data mining","data mining;pattern clustering;power engineering computing;power system faults;power system security;power system transient stability;principal component analysis","real-time application;indirect power-system contingency screening method;adaptive PCA;data-mining method;indirect contingency screening;power-system operating conditions;Slovenian power-system model;first-swing stability issues;pre-fault operating conditions;measurement matrix;measurements matrix;principal component analysis method;real-time steady-state conditions;database clusters;global screening;coordinate system;second-stage screening;contingency impact;operating state","","4","","28","IEEE","28 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, identification of suitable locations, where the effect of these FACTs devices will be most beneficial to the network, has been a growing concern to electric power utilities in planning and operation of power systems. Consequently, a safe and reliable power system operation requires that all operating states, which could be used to enhance power system operation such as voltage profile enhancement and loss reduction, must be quickly detected and identified. This paper, therefore, introduces a Line Strength Index (LSI) for identifying suitable locations where reactive power supports such as Thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) could be located for voltage profile enhancement and transmission loss reduction within the system. Furthermore, the influence of TCSC placement on the voltage profile and transmission losses is investigated. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a simple 6-bus power network. The results obtained are compared with that obtained when TCSC is placed at a randomly selected location. This shows that the integrity of a stressed power network, in terms of security and reliability, could be easily enhanced through the application of TCSC whose placement is determined by LSI, a non-iterative-based approach.","","978-1-5386-7709-4","10.1109/CTEMS.2018.8769127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8769127","voltage profile;transmission loss;thyristor-controlled series capacitor;coupling strength matrix;line strength index","Thyristors;Power capacitors;Reactive power;Large scale integration;Power transmission lines;Propagation losses","electricity supply industry;flexible AC transmission systems;power capacitors;power system security;power transmission planning;power transmission reliability;reactive power;thyristors","voltage profile enhancement;transmission loss reduction;TCSC placement;identifying suitable locations;reactive power;electric power utilities;operating states;power system operation;FACT devices;power system planning;LSI;thyristor-controlled series capacitor;system reliability;line strength index;noniterative-based approach;system security;6-bus power network operation","","1","","21","IEEE","25 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed model focuses on static security analysis, where the main objective is to access the existing operating state of the system. If the state is found to be secure, contingency analysis is performed to evaluate system vulnerability and time necessary to obtain such results. This time is compared to traditional computational techniques to evaluate static security of a power system.

These substations are remotely operated by two Operating Centers - Transmission Operating Center (COT Centro de Operacao da Transmissao), Bom Jardim SP, and Back-end Operating Center (COR - Centro de Operacao Retaguarda), Cabreiiva SP. Through the years, CTEEP has been deploying its high reliability and throughput WAN/LAN to connect all of its key facilities. Based on such corporate network infrastructure, it was possible to provide remote operations with a visual, real time monitoring system. Its structure comprises cameras installed in substation strategic spots, local digital image recorder and devices to convert and regulate video streams and control cameras, and Ethernet network interfaces. The system allows visual checking of operating handling, physical status of substation yard, and perimeter integrity thus addressing many corporative areas' needs. Since there is a high reliability, high throughput corporative network infrastructure available to connect main facilities, it enable us to provide remote substation operations with support of a visual, real time monitoring system, which comprises camera movement control, tamper-proof recording, image transmission and viewing, both locally and remotely. SIM - Sistema Integrado de Monitoramento (Integrated Monitoring System) is a joint project among CTEEP's Enterprise Security, Information Technology, and Maintenance and Operations organizations. It aims to deploy a visual monitoring system for electrical substations providing camera movement control, tamper-proof recording, image transmission and viewing, both locally and remotely using existent corporative network (""browser-based""). It allows electrical system operations and enterprise security organizations to monitor substations and other CTEEP facilities through images transmitted via data channels (corporative network), which are enabled by heterogeneous technologies and throughput, from frame relay (64Kbs to 512Kbps) to fiber optic/digital radio links (2Mbps). By promoting integration of video, audio, and text information, and by associating it to company existing databases, SIM also meets CTEEP's strategic goals related to information system integration (technological convergence). In addition to align strategic information integration goals, SIM deployment will provide CTEEP Electrical Transmission System operators with environmental viewing of facilities in a real-time, strategic way, enabling an improvement of operating processes. SIM usage means lower costs related to staff displacement to remotely assisted substations, either for equipment handling checking, equipment current status checking or substation areas physical integrity checking. All of these intended to optimize access to substations risk areas. Also, note that such solution means lower operating and maintenance costs for entire company due to its standardization.","","978-1-4577-0488-8","10.1109/TDC-LA.2010.5762915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5762915","Information Integration;Visual;Real Time Monitoring;Substation Remote Operation;Enterprise Security;Operating Security","Substations;Cameras;Monitoring;Visualization;Security;Real time systems;Streaming media","computerised monitoring;local area networks;power engineering computing;substation automation;wide area networks","real-time monitoring system;remote operation;electrical substations;WAN-LAN;local digital image recorder;video streams;control cameras;Ethernet network interfaces;corporative network infrastructure;camera movement control;tamper-proof recording;image transmission;frame relay;fiber optic links;digital radio links;equipment handling checking;equipment current status checking;substation areas physical integrity checking;operating security;CTEEP;transmission operating center;back-end operating center;remote substation operations;integrated monitoring system;visual monitoring system","","4","","6","IEEE","5 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This leads to open and outsourcing all or part of their information system (IS) to create collaborative processes by composing business services picked in each partner IS and to take advantage of Cloud computing. Business services outsourcing and their dynamic collaboration context can bring lost of control on IS and new security risks can occur. This leads to inconsistent protection allowing competitors to access to unauthorized information. To address this issue, systematic security service invocations may be added, without paying attention to the business context leading to costly over protection. To address this issue, an adaptive security service model deployment is required to provide a business service consistent protection by taking into account the collaboration context (business service data criticity, partners involved in the collaboration, etc.), and the cloud deployment and execution environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security model based on MDS@run.time, the marriage of Model Driven Security (MDS) and Models@run.time approaches, allowing to select at runtime the appropriate security components to apply. The MDS approach is used to generate security policies, which are interpreted at runtime and load appropriate security mechanisms depending on the context (which takes advantage of the Models@run.time approach) ensuring business process end to end protection. A proof of concept prototype is built on top of the OW2 FraSCAti middleware, validating our proposition efficiency. Our experiments and simulations show that MDS@run.time improves the system efficiency when the over-protection risk rate increases.","","978-1-4799-8356-8","10.1109/SOSE.2015.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133513","","Context;Business;Authentication;Context modeling;Middleware;Collaboration","cloud computing;groupware;information systems;middleware;outsourcing;risk management;security of data;software performance evaluation","service protection optimization;model driven security@run.time;MDS@run.time;collaborative business;information system;business services outsourcing;dynamic collaboration context;cloud computing;security risks;adaptive security service model deployment;business service consistent protection;business service data criticity;cloud deployment;execution environment;Models@run.time;security policy generation;OW2 FraSCAti middleware;system efficiency improvement;over-protection risk rate","","2","","29","IEEE","25 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional security systems are password based making them susceptible to problems such as forgetting the password and passwords being stolen. Biometrics, due to their uniqueness and accuracy are now widely used for authentication and identification. However unimodal biometrics has certain limitations. To overcome the problems in unimodal biometrics and to increase the level of security multimodal biometrics is used. Multimodal biometrics is of different types, multi algorithmic, multi instance and multi sensorial. This paper introduces a new personal identification framework that is based on the fusion of face and fingerprint biometrics. Face is being processed using two algorithms, Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to reduce the recognition error. After being processed by LDA, output of LDA is provided to PCA. Then fingerprint is processed using crossing number based method. Finally output from PCA and fingerprint are combined using matching score based on sum rule. Experimental results performed on a given database of face and fingerprint images shows that the proposed framework improved greatly the security and recognition rate.","","978-1-5090-4257-9","10.1109/ICOEI.2017.8300965","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8300965","Biometrics;LDA;PCA;Crossing number method","Fingerprint recognition;Principal component analysis;Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Security;Training","authorisation;biometrics (access control);face recognition;feature extraction;fingerprint identification;principal component analysis","personal authentication;conventional security systems;unimodal biometrics;personal identification framework;fingerprint biometrics;PCA;multimodal biometric security;face biometrics;linear discriminant analysis;principal component analysis","","","","12","IEEE","22 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Experiments and analysis show that client arrival rate is not sufficient for making an adaptation decision. The average requested file size and the client session duration play key roles in the performance effect of such an adaptation. Adaptation with file sizes larger than 8192 bytes and small session durations result in greater performance impact when the server is under heavy load.","","978-0-7695-3448-0","10.1109/PRDC.2008.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725310","Self-adaptation;automation;security;SSL/TLS;performance;trade-off","Runtime;Data security;Quality of service;Costs;Protocols;Communication system security;Programmable control;Adaptive control;Adaptive systems;File servers","client-server systems;fault tolerant computing;security of data","runtime security self-adaptation;SSL/TLS;client-server scenario;transport layer security;secure socket layer","","5","1","13","IEEE","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this respect, the future SPSs provide great advantages but really complicate and introduce new challenges about system security and stability. Hence, exact evaluation of system dynamic performance has become a major concern and require an effective simulation-based modeling.

Security agents, such as cops, use public camera footage to track down the accused's movements. People are assigned to this responsibility of watching the public camera recordings. These individuals must constantly watch the detected faces and compare them to the accused faces. However, because this is a continual process, there is a high risk of manual errors when utilizing this method. The accused person's face can also be discovered using this method, but by the time the assigned person tells the nearest police station, the accused person may have left/escaped. With all of these considerations in mind, it is necessary to avoid these blunders. Manual mistake in determining the perpetrator's face and relaying the information to officials swiftly are the main problems. Installing a camera with an already supplied data collection of suspected people can help cross-check the detected faces with the uploaded data set, which is the first issue. This improves the precision of the accused's detection. The second issue is telling officials about the suspected criminal or accused in a timely manner. If the installed camera has a transmitting unit, with the receiver on the official side and the transmitter on the camera end, this will work. The information is swiftly transmitted to the authorities, and there is a good possibility that the perpetrator will be apprehended. A frequency band is fundamental for any transmission to actually occur. The frequency ranges essential for the above-mentioned transferring data are 400–500 Hz and 900–1000 Hz. The LoRa module will be used to use these bandwidths.","","978-1-6654-7719-2","10.1109/IATMSI56455.2022.10119278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10119278","LoRa;Transmission;Arduino;criminal detection","Training;Technological innovation;Transmitters;Tracking;Manuals;Watches;Cameras;Web servers;Textile antennas;Faces","cameras;face recognition;police data processing;surveillance","burglary;camera end;crimes;criminals;frequency 400.0 Hz to 500.0 Hz;frequency 900.0 Hz to 1000.0 Hz;LoRa module;manual mistake;nearest police station;officials;perpetrator;public camera footage;public camera recordings;security agents;supplied data collection;thefts","","","","15","IEEE","15 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal of the SMM is to perform system management functions, such as hardware control and power management. Because of this, SMM has powerful resources. Moreover, its executive software executes unnoticed by any other component in the system, including operating systems and hypervisors. For that reason, SMM has been exploited in the past to facilitate attacks, misuse, or alternatively, building security tools capitalising on its resources. In this paper, we discuss how the use of the SMM has been contributing to the arms race between system's attackers and defenders. We analyse the main work published on attacks, misuse and implementing security tools in the SMM and how the SMM has been modified to respond to those issues. Finally, we discuss how Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology, a sort of ""hypervisor in processor"", presents a possible answer to the issue of using SMM for security purposes.","","978-1-4799-8937-9","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336375","SMM;security;PC architecture;virtualization;SGX","Security;Registers;Hardware;Operating systems;Virtual machine monitors;Process control","operating systems (computers);security of data;virtualisation","SMM;system management mode;processor operating mode;hardware control;power management;operating systems;hypervisors;system attackers;system defenders;Intel Software Guard Extensions technology;SGX technology;hypervisor","","","","37","IEEE","30 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, network providers are incapable of handling all types of attacks as each security device is designed for a certain purpose. If an attack breaks out, only one particular device becomes busy in terms of resource usage while others being idle. Moreover, it is hard to adjust a level of security service with respect to the importance of network flow. To address these issues, we propose a new security solution, QoSE, which provides adaptive security services based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV). QoSE provides a capability to manage resource usage that the network flow is not concentrated on a specific node. We design QoSE considering a distributed NFV environment to avoid a single point of failure and a bottleneck problem. Our proposed solution has also shown a quick recovery from fault situation. In addition, we provide a novel resource optimization algorithm to operate security services efficiently. We have implemented a prototype system to verify our ideas and have checked that QoSE shows reasonable performance compared with a common device.","1938-1883","978-1-4799-6664-6","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510777","","Quality of service;Security;Ports (Computers);Bandwidth;Resource management;Switches;Optimization","computer network security;optimisation;quality of experience;quality of service;virtualisation","quality of security;QoSE;network security framework;network attacks;network providers;security device;network flow;adaptive security services;network function virtualization;distributed NFV environment;fault situation;resource optimization algorithm","","5","","17","IEEE","14 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the first stage, with day-ahead PV and load predictions, the central controller (CC) performs optimal power flow (OPF) to determine the hourly dispatch of on-load tap changers (OLTC) and capacitor banks (CBs). In the second stage, the ADN is partitioned into different zones only based on PV and load types. The zone controllers (ZC), which is formulated by deep neural networks (DNN), then communicate with their neighbors and track the optimal total reactive power support of PVs in each zone. In the offline training process, an analytical derivation to minimize power losses is also provided that can help the input and output selection of DNN. To online dispatch reactive power for individual utility-scale and customer-owned PVs in corresponding zones, a multi-mode reactive power allocation strategy is proposed. Three different modes namely loss reduction mode (LRM), fair power sharing mode (FPM) and voltage security mode (VSM) are designed to meet varying operation requirements, which can mitigate voltage violations with fair participation for customers and reduced power losses for system operators. Numerical simulations are performed on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in finding a trade-off between voltage security and loss minimization with fairness.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2022.3213587","ARC Research Hub(grant numbers:IH180100020); ARC Training Centre(grant numbers:IC200100023); ARC Linkage Project(grant numbers:LP200100056); ARC(grant numbers:DP220103881); Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society (AIRS); National Natural Science Foundation of China (Key Program)(grant numbers:71931003,72061147004); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72171206); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9916057","Combined central and distributed;deep neural networks;multi-mode reactive power allocation;Volt/Var control;customer-owned PVs","Voltage control;Reactive power;Optimization;Capacitors;Voltage measurement;Training;Security","deep learning (artificial intelligence);load flow control;load forecasting;numerical analysis;on load tap changers;photovoltaic power systems;power distribution control;power engineering computing;power generation control;power generation dispatch;power grids;power system security;reactive power control;voltage control","active distribution networks;ADN;capacitor banks;central controller;customer-owned photovoltaic system;day-ahead PV;deep neural networks;dispatch reactive power;DNN;IEEE 33-bus distribution system;load predictions;load types;loss minimization;loss reduction mode;multimode reactive power allocation strategy;numerical simulations;offline training process;on-load tap changers;optimal power flow;optimal total reactive power support;power losses;power sharing mode;system operators;two-stage combined central and distributed Volt-Var control strategy;utility-scale;voltage regulation;voltage security;voltage security mode;voltage violations;zone controllers","","","","33","IEEE","11 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the grid-connected state, the DC microgrid exchanges energy with the large grid through the grid-connected converter; in the off-grid state, the photovoltaic module and the hybrid energy storage module coordinate and cooperate to supply power to the local load, avoiding the small-scale fluctuation of the DC bus voltage.

This concept is extended in UWA channels with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems and implements a protocol to generate secret keys adaptively based on the channel frequency response (CFR).

This has been demonstrated by a growing number of new encryption algorithms, more intelligent firewall and intrusion detection techniques, new developments in multifactor authentication, advances in malware protection and many more. During a similar period of time the industry has seen the need for network infrastructure which provides a greater degree of trust which has resulted in the development of forensic analysis tools which meet the requirements of law enforcement agencies. Such tools must provide for commercial intelligence and national security. This paper proposes that application of the common ground between security and forensics has great potential to provide for improvements in the effort to achieve real-time adaptive security. This implies an architecture which can detect security breaches and in real-time record and analyse traffic logs in a forensically sound manner, provide corrective feedback to security devices and attempt to trace back to the source of the attack. In addressing computer security and forensic analysis from a real-time perspective, this paper recognises that some of these processes already exist, but proposes methods whereby the ongoing damage and potential risk to critical infrastructure can be reduced. This requires the implementation of a highly integrated approach to security and forensics such that they can inter-work in real-time in order to address the significant security issues which currently face the industry.","","978-1-4244-8484-3","10.1109/NSS.2010.38","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5635616","critical infrastructure;network forensics;real-time adaptive security","Security;Forensics;Fires;Real time systems;Servers;Computer architecture;Adaptive systems","authorisation;computer forensics;real-time systems","network security design;intrusion detection techniques;firewall;multifactor authentication;forensic analysis tools;real-time adaptive security","","3","","11","IEEE","15 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A biometric system works by collecting important biological or behavioural traits of the prospective user. Extracted traits are stored as a feature template in the database of the biometric system. The reliability and accuracy of the biometric systems are improved by using multiple modalities, sensors or algorithms during recognition process. These systems are called as Multibiomtric systems which results into greater accuracy but with increased cost and complexity. In comparison to unibiometric system, a multi-modal system provides better recognition performance and protection from spoof attacks. Biometric systems are generally used in modern day computing to provide security during authentication in many applications but these systems themselves are vulnerable to various types of attacks. In this paper, an analysis of various security issues and template security schemes for Biometric Systems is presented. One of the challenges is to protect user's raw image data from imposters as well as to secure template data. It is found that template data security is a major design issue and needs to be addressed by designing low overhead security schemes. Template security schemes are dependent on the overall performance parameters of the system and must be computationally hard to avoid modality reconstruction.","","978-1-4673-8253-3","10.1109/RAECS.2015.7453302","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7453302","Biometric systems;Feature Template;Template security;privacy protection;Multimodal biometrics;Feature fusion","Databases;Fingerprint recognition;Feature extraction;Cryptography;Sensors","data protection;feature extraction;object recognition;security of data;visual databases","performance analysis;template data security;template data protection;biometric system database;human identification;human verification;biological traits;behavioural traits;feature template;recognition process;multibiomtric systems;unibiometric system;multimodal system;spoof attacks;security issues;template security schemes;user raw image data protection","","6","","21","IEEE","19 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The error in the input data may result in a misleading index which either increases system operating costs or jeopardizes service continuity. This paper aims at establishing an step-by-step algorithm to study impacts of error in measurements on system security indices. Two different security indices representing under voltage severity and over load severity are studied in this paper. The proposed algorithm has three major steps. In the first step, typical measurements are sampled according to the system operating state and randomly generated errors. This is done using Monte Carlo sampling approach. The second step is to extract an approximate model of the system true state which is done via state estimators. Then, security indices are calculated for both the approximated and true states in the third step. Comparison between the indices demonstrates impacts of the erroneous measurements on security assessment.","2164-7054","978-1-4799-1972-7","10.1109/IranianCEE.2015.7146480","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7146480","Erroneous measurement;Monte Carlo simulation;security analysis;state estimation","Decision support systems;Electrical engineering;Conferences","measurement errors;Monte Carlo methods;power system security","security assessment;Monte Carlo sampling approach;randomly generated errors;over load severity;voltage severity;power system real-time security analysis;erroneous measurements","","3","","11","IEEE","2 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Storing data and performing computations using for example cloud services is commonplace nowadays. However, the information security in network-based computation rarely is satisfactory. One technique to improve information security for networked computations is based on secure multiparty computations. The idea of multiparty computation originates from Yao, who considered the secure computation with two parties by introducing the technique called garbled circuits. The technique was then generalized, but still the exact definitions for different security measures were not established until Bellare, Hoang and Rogaway proposed a definition of a garbling scheme and several security notions for garbling schemes. This gave inspiration to study the security properties of garbling schemes from different perspectives, including adaptivity and reusability. In this paper, we study the adaptive security for a certain type of reusable garbling schemes. First, we consider general constraints to achieve security for this specific type of garbling schemes. Then we analyze the adaptive security classes of reusable garbling schemes. More specifically, we prove a relation between security classes that has been left open in earlier research.","","978-1-4799-6239-6","10.1109/CIT.2014.63","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984672","secure multiparty computations;garbling schemes;reusability;adaptive security;projectivity","Games;Medical diagnostic imaging;Software;Encryption;Adaptation models;Privacy","computer network security","reusable projective garbling scheme;network-based computation;data storage;cloud service;information security;networked computation;secure multiparty computation;garbled circuits;security measures;security properties;adaptive security","","1","","24","IEEE","15 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a newly designed framework for Modular Addition over field GF(2) satisfying the algebraic properties of regular Modular Addition 2n albeit with cumulative security enhancements and increased complexity to address these challenges. Nevertheless, it has been observed that the complexity of Modular Addition can be drastically decreased with the appropriate formulation of polynomial equations and probabilistic conditions. In this article we propose a new extended design framework for advanced Modular Addition and it is characterized by user-specified extendable security which does not impose additional changes in existing layout of ciphers including both stream and block ciphers. This framework can be rapidly scaled to use-specific requirements which boosts the algebraic degree of the overall structure. This, in turn it thwarts the probabilistic conditions by retaining the original hardware complexity sans critical modifications of Modular Addition 2n.","","978-1-908320-73-5","10.1109/ICITST.2016.7856683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7856683","Algebraic Cryptanalysis;Addition Modulo;Algebraic Degree;Scalability;SNOW2.0;TRIVIUM;S-Box;IDEA;AES;LFSR;NFSR;SAT solver;Stream Cipher;Block Cipher","Ciphers;Complexity theory;Mathematical model;Internet;Input variables","computational complexity;cryptography;formal logic;polynomials;probability","adaptive security framework;extensible computational complexity;cipher systems;algebraic cryptanalysis;algebraic tools;cryptosystems;modular addition;logic exclusive-OR;security threats;polynomial equations;probabilistic conditions;hardware complexity","","1","","15","","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As an important building block of the ICT system, power system state estimation is of critical importance to maintain normal operation of the smart grid, which, however, is under mounting threat from potential cyber attacks. In this article, we introduce a graph-based framework for performing cyber-security analysis in power system state estimation. Compared to conventional arithmetic- based security analysis, the graphical characterization of state estimation security provides intuitive visualization of some complex problem structures and enables efficient graphical solution algorithms, which are useful for both defending and attacking the ICT system of the smart grid.

To ensure the system stability and minimize potential economic losses, it is imperative to monitor operating states and detect attacks at the early stage. To meet this demand, Micro-Phasor Measurement Units (μPMU) are increasingly popular in monitoring distribution networks. However, due to the relatively low sampling rate, μPMU has not yet been used to detect and classify cyber-attacks in power electronics enabled smart grid. To our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to use μPMU to detect cyber attacks that degrade the performance of power electronics systems. We propose to apply data-driven methods on micro-PMU data to implement attack detection. We have evaluated data-driven methods, including decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN).

A joint reserve scheduling model considering the cross-sectorial impacts of operation uncertainties is essential but still insufficient to guarantee the reliable operation of the integrated electricity and natural gas system (IEGS). Therefore, this paper proposes a day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model for the IEGS to schedule the operation and reserve si-multaneously considering reliability requirements. Firstly, the multi-state models for generating units and gas wells are established. Based on the multi-state models, the expected unserved energy cost (EUEC) and the expected wind curtailment cost (EWC) criteria are proposed based on probabilistic methods considering wind fluctuation and random failures of components in IEGS. Furthermore, the EUEC and EWC criteria are incorporated into the day-ahead SCUC model, which is noncon-vex and mathematically reformulated into a solvable mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) problem. The proposed model is validated using an IEEE 30-bus system and Belgium 20-node natural gas system. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively schedule the energy reserve to guarantee the reliable operation of the IEGS considering the multiple uncertainties in different subsystems and the cross-sectorial failure propagation.","2196-5420","","10.35833/MPCE.2021.000028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584449","Integrated electricity and natural gas system (IEGS);natural gas reserve;electric reserve;expected unserved energy cost;expected wind curtailment;multi-state model;operational reliability","Reliability;Power system reliability;Natural gas;Uncertainty;Wind power generation;Probabilistic logic;Modeling","concave programming;demand side management;integer programming;natural gas technology;power generation dispatch;power generation reliability;power generation scheduling;probability;thermal power stations","Belgium 20-node natural gas system;cross-sectorial failure propagation;cross-sectorial impacts;day-ahead SCUC model;day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment model;EUEC criteria;EWC criteria;expected unserved energy cost criteria;expected wind curtailment cost criteria;gas well systems;IEEE 30-bus system;IEGS;integrated electricity and natural gas system;joint reserve scheduling model;MISOCP problem;mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem;multistate models;optimal energy reserve scheduling;reliability requirements;wind fluctuation","","","","31","","22 Oct 2021","","","SGEPRI","SGEPRI Journals"

Toward this end, we expand the notion of QoS to include the level of security that can be offered within performance and CPU resource availability constraints. To address performance and security tradeoffs in asymmetric and dynamic client-server environments, we developed Authenticast, a dynamically configurable user-level communication protocol offering variable levels of security throughout the execution. Authenticast comprises multiple heuristics to realize dynamic security levels and to decide when and how to apply dynamic security. To demonstrate this protocol, we have implemented a prototype of a high-performance privacy system. This prototype offers a novel security control abstraction with which tradeoffs in security vs. performance may be made explicit and then utilized with dynamic client-server asymmetries. Authenticast uses the ""security thermostat"" to enable adaptive security processing. The results demonstrate increased scalability and improved performance when adaptive security is applied to the client-server platform with varying numbers of clients and varying resource availabilities at clients.","","0-7803-4482-0","10.1109/IWQOS.1998.675229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=675229","","Authentication;Communication system security;Information security;Availability;Protocols;Prototypes;Protection;Computer applications;Computer networks;Privacy","computer network management;message authentication;client-server systems;performance evaluation;electronic data interchange;telecommunication services;data privacy","dynamic authentication;high-performance networked computing applications;information exchange;information integrity;information protection;security procedures;public communications media;tradeoffs;service quality;CPU resource availability constraints;asymmetric dynamic client-server environments;Authenticast;dynamically configurable user-level communication protocol;multiple heuristics;dynamic security levels;high-performance privacy system;security control abstraction;security thermostat;adaptive security processing;scalability;resource availability","","19","14","15","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method thus provides operators with information on the near-future reliability of the power system and has the ability to warn them when preventive actions might be required. To achieve a sufficient accuracy, this assessment must take into account multi-state components such as generating units with derated states, multiple transmission lines with common-mode outages and the uncertainty on the load forecast. To achieve the speed required for online use, the method relies on the State Space Partitioning (SSP) technique, which divides the system state space into two subspaces. The system states with a large probability of occurrence comprise the first subspace and are identified using the Fast Sorting Technique (FST). System states that have a low probability of occurrence but which could have severe consequences are sampled using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) over the residual subspace. This computational acceleration is particularly important when multi-state components are taken into account. Tests carried out using the IEEE-RTS demonstrate the speed and accuracy of this enhanced SSP method.","","978-1-4244-5721-2","10.1109/PMAPS.2010.5528895","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5528895","short-term reliability;multi-state components;Monte Carlo simulation;state enumeration;state space partitioning","Power system reliability;Power system security;Power system modeling;State-space methods;Space power stations;Sorting;Power transmission lines;Load forecasting;Uncertainty;Real time systems","Monte Carlo methods;power system reliability","online short-term reliability assessment;power system reliability;state space partitioning;SSP technique;fast sorting technique;Monte Carlo simulation;IEEE-RTS","","1","","15","IEEE","29 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, in this paper, we are contemplating the feasibility of an approach to probing attacks that are the basis of others attacks in computer network systems. Our approach adopts a supervised neural network phenomenon that is majorly used for detecting security attacks.

On the basis of the model, the hybrid control is proposed, which consists of upper level control strategies (including logic control commands for discrete events and energy management strategies) and lower level continuous controls for component units. The upper level control strategies are responsible for switching operating modes for the purpose of security operation following a significant disturbance, as well as power assignment for the economical efficiency of operation, and the lower level continuous controllers are responsible for regulating dynamic stability of the systems.

Firstly, a state observer is constructed to mitigate the impact of sensor attacks. And then neural networks are used to approximate the nonlinear term and compensate for state-dependent actuator attacks. Finally, in order to reduce the impact of FDI attacks, we design a special time-varying symmetry barrier function in backstepping control design, which can achieve specific output signal constraints under FDI attacks.

A variety of biometrics are being used, such as finger sensors and digital signatures. A multimodal biometric system combines more traits and provides maximum accuracy in authenticating the users. The aim of this survey is to delineate the importance of using multimodal biometrics. Getting illegitimate access in unimodal biometric systems is easy, but multimodal biometric systems need more effort to break into the system. A digital biometric system works on the physiological and behavioural characteristics of an individual. It determines identification through automated technology. Many companies are investing large amounts in multimodal biometric systems and they are mostly being used in IoT devices for security purposes. An economy based on digital computing technologies is a digital economy and multimodal biometric systems are enhancing it.

In this connection, several novel approaches for assessing vulnerability in real time have been developed. However, most of the work is commonly focused on tackling stability phenomena, while the possible overloads are often treated as negligible in real-time power system security. But sometimes, high electric post-contingency currents might provoke overloads which could increase the system vulnerability problem. This paper presents a novel method for assessing the possibility of fast post-contingency overloads using Statistical Distribution Factors (SDFs) that allow computing an Overload Index (OVI) in real time. First, Monte Carlo-based contingency analysis is performed to iteratively calculate ac Distribution Factors (ac-DFs). After, SDFs are defined by the mean and standard deviation of ac-DFs. These SDFs are then used together with principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine classifier (SVM-C) in order to structure a table-based real-time post-contingency overload estimation algorithm, which allow computing OVIs depending on the actual operating state and the type of contingency. The proposal is tested on the IEEE New England 39-bus test system. Results show the feasibility of the methodology in alerting about fast possible overloads.","","978-1-4673-2673-5","10.1109/TDC-LA.2012.6319111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6319111","Monte Carlo;overload;principal component analysis;security;smart grid;support vector machine;vulnerability assessment","Power system stability;Real-time systems;Load flow;Thermal stability;Stability analysis;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines","Monte Carlo methods;pattern classification;power engineering computing;power system planning;power system reliability;power system security;power system stability;principal component analysis;real-time systems;smart power grids;statistical distributions;support vector machines","probabilistic-based overload estimation;real-time smart grid vulnerability assessment;power system control;power system protection;power system monitoring;stability;real-time power system security;high electric post-contingency currents;power system vulnerability problem;fast post-contingency overloads;statistical distribution factors;SDF;overload index;OVI;Monte Carlo-based contingency analysis;iterative calculation;ac distribution factors;ac-DF;principal component analysis;PCA;support vector machine classifier;SVM-C;table-based real-time post-contingency overload estimation algorithm;IEEE New England 39-bus test system","","8","","34","IEEE","4 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is well known that induction motor loads have a particularly hazardous role in the voltage stability. On the other hand, in transmission systems loaded by induction motor loads, configuration changes such as line tripping, may cause voltage collapse. Moreover, if there is a fault on transmission lines, the disturbance effect will then significantly increase the possibility of voltage collapse. In this study, a transmission system subjected to different faults on different locations is examined from the viewpoint of voltage stability. The study shows that in the certain cases of paralleled transmission lines, single or double phase tripping of a faulted line will have positive effects on voltage stability, instead of all three phase tripping.","","0-7803-5836-8","10.1109/PTC.1999.826511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=826511","","Transmission lines;Voltage;Circuit faults;Power system stability;Power transmission lines;Power system dynamics;Induction motors;Power system modeling;Reactive power;Power system faults","power transmission control;power transmission faults;power transmission lines;power system dynamic stability;control system analysis;induction motors;load (electric);power system security","transmission line faults;dynamic voltage stability;power systems;induction motor loads;transmission systems;line tripping;voltage collapse;transmission lines faults;paralleled transmission lines;single-phase tripping;double-phase tripping","","2","","2","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper tackles the possible overload issues by applying a novel adaptive load shedding (ALS) method. First, the possibility of fast post-contingency overloads is evaluated using Statistical Distribution Factors (SDFs) that allow computing an Overload Index (OVI) in real time. The results are then used for triggering an adequate ALS scheme that allows improving the system security level when the OVI reaches a critical value. For this purpose, Monte Carlo-based contingency analysis is firstly performed to iteratively calculate ac Distribution Factors (ac-DFs). After, SDFs are defined by the mean of ac-DFs. These SDFs are then used together with principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine classifier (SVM-C) in order to structure a table-based real-time post-contingency overload estimation algorithm, which allow computing OVIs depending on the actual operating state and the type of contingency. In the cases where OVI reaches inadmissible levels, an ALS scheme is triggered using a centralized strategy. The aim is to alleviate the current in overloaded transmission lines before the local overload protection acts, since it might initiate a cascading event that would eventually drive the system to a blackout. The proposal is structured to act in coordination with the traditional underfrequency and undervoltage load shedding. For this purpose, PMU measurements of voltage phasors and frequency are used for evaluating the event evolution in order to determine the adequate amount of load to be shed due to overload problems. The scheme also determines the location of the load to be shed by analyzing the participation of each load in the overloaded line via the computation of electrical distances between the overloaded-line receiving-end bus and the load bus. The proposal is tested on the IEEE New England 39-bus test system. Results show the feasibility of the methodology in alerting about possible overloads and defining an appropriate ALS scheme that allows alleviating the current in the possible overloaded lines.","","978-1-4799-6251-8","10.1109/TDC-LA.2014.6955190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6955190","Monte Carlo;overload;principal component analysis;security;smart grid;support vector machine;vulnerability assessment;adaptive load shedding‥","Load flow;Real-time systems;Estimation;Indexes;Security;Power system stability;Principal component analysis","load shedding;Monte Carlo methods;phasor measurement;power system security;power transmission lines;principal component analysis;support vector machines","event evolution;electrical distances;overloaded-line receiving-end bus;load bus;IEEE New England 39-bus test system;voltage phasors;PMU measurements;cascading event;overloaded transmission lines;table-based real-time post-contingency overload estimation algorithm;SVM-C;support vector machine classifier;PCA;principal component analysis;ac-DF;ac distribution factors;Monte Carlo-based contingency analysis;system security level;OVI;overload index;SDFs;statistical distribution factors;fast post-contingency overloads;ALS method;adaptive load shedding method;overload issues;high electric post-contingency currents;real-time power system security;stability phenomena","","4","","11","IEEE","13 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we consider that the transition between different modes follows a Markov chain model with a certain transition probability. However, when the Stuxnet attack is launched, the attack signals with random multitude and frequency will be injected to trigger more hazard modes, and finally, hasten fatigue of control devices. Under this unpredictable attack, the transition between operating modes will not follow the regular transition probabilities. Therefore, a hidden Markov model with time-varying transition probabilities is utilized to describe the Stuxnet attack. The transition probabilities are estimated based on the measurements. By recognizing operating modes and predicting the number of the occurrence of hazard modes, the Stuxnet attack can be detected earlier if the predicted value exceeds the threshold. In the operating mode recognition, the expectation maximization algorithm is used to estimate the parameters considering random packet dropouts caused by the unreliable network.

These axiomatic assumptions are, however, increasingly untrue in contemporary software development practices in which software systems evolve drastically in later stages. In addition, software-intensive systems are increasingly faced with uncertainty in their operational contexts, and these are nearly impossible to enumerate in early development stages.

To deal with the bad meter measurements caused by various faults in state estimation, power system researchers have developed numerous detection schemes in the past. Liu et al. recently proposed a new stealthy false data injection attack, which can bypass the existing bad data detection schemes and arbitrarily manipulate the states of power system, posing dangerous threats to the control of a power system. Nevertheless, their results did not show the detailed information of meters to be compromised. In this paper, we tend to tackle this issue and develop mechanisms to efficiently compute the optimal set of meter measurements given a number of state variables to be manipulated in a power-grid network. We formalize the problem of finding the optimal set of meter measurements as a known NP-hard problem and propose a heuristic approach to derive the near-optimal set of meter measurements efficiently. We implement our proposed scheme on the IEEE 9-bus, 14-bus, 30-bus, 118-bus and 300-bus systems and our data shows its efficiency and effectiveness.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-9268-8","10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134479","","State estimation;Vectors;Power systems;Search methods;Equations;Power measurement;Educational institutions","computational complexity;power grids;power system faults;power system measurement;power system security;power system state estimation","hierarchical false data injection attack;power system state estimation;best-fit state estimation;meter measurements;power-grid network;power system faults;bad data detection schemes;power system control;NP-hard problem;heuristic approach;IEEE bus system","","6","","14","IEEE","19 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The output of a single execution, presented to the control center operator, consists of the static security assessment and five different strategies for security enhancement. Each strategy is the solution of a different SCOPF problem, each having a different mix of base case corrective, precontingent preventive and postcontingent corrective action. The SCOPF solutions incorporate base case and contingent state load flow solutions, network switching, staged constraint and control activation, and linear program solutions.

The proposed waveform has three modes of operation and maximum achievable throughput of 1.33 Mbps. The user throughput of the proposed hybrid waveform is compared with the classical CDMA scheme using the same bandwidth.

On the other hand, it also makes the power system more vulnerable to various kinds of attacks. One attack that has serious consequences is the False Data Injection (FDI) attack against the state estimation process. Although some techniques have been proposed to select meters to protect, none of them considers the cost of protecting meters, and thus will not perform well when only a limited number of meters can be protected due to budget limitation. In this paper, we consider a new problem: Given a limited budget, how to select the most critical meters to protect so that the probability of attackers launching successful stealthy FDI attack is minimized? We first formalize this problem which is NP-complete, and then propose heuristic based solutions. The idea is to rank and select meters based on a metric called vulnerability index, which considers two factors: how likely the meter will be targeted by the attacker to launch FDI attacks and how much damage will be caused by compromising the meter in case of a successful stealthy FDI attack. Evaluation results show that our algorithm can significantly reduce the probability of successful attacks, as well as the potential damage caused by FDI attacks.","","978-1-5386-4586-4","10.1109/CNS.2018.8433215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8433215","","Meters;State estimation;Voltage measurement;Monitoring;Security;Smart grids","computational complexity;power engineering computing;power system security;probability;SCADA systems;security of data;smart power grids;state estimation","protecting meters;critical meters;successful stealthy FDI attack;FDI attacks;successful attacks;smart grid;enhanced capabilities;SCADA system;power system;operating states;state estimation process;mitigating stealthy false data injection attacks;false data injection attack","","3","","25","IEEE","13 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For real-time voltage/reactive power control, a suboptimal power flow procedure has been derived by using a reduced set of control variables. This procedure is based on sensitivity theory applied to the determination of zones for the secondary voltage/reactive power control and the corresponding reduced set of regulating sources, whose reactive outputs represent control variables in the optimal power flow program.

Temporal diversity can be achieved by making periodic configuration changes; however in an infrastructure of multiple similarly purposed computers diversity must also be spatial, ensuring multiple computers do not simultaneously share the same configuration and potential vulnerabilities. Given the number of possible changes and their potential interdependencies discovering computer configurations that are secure, functional, and diverse is challenging. This paper describes how a Genetic Algorithm (GA) can be employed to find temporally and spatially diverse secure computer configurations. In the proposed approach a computer configuration is modeled as a chromosome, where an individual configuration setting is a trait or allele. The GA operates by combining multiple chromosomes (configurations) which are tested for feasibility and ranked based on performance which will be measured as resistance to attack. Successive iterations of the GA yield configurations that are often more secure and diverse due to the crossover and mutation processes. Simulations results will demonstrate this approach can provide at MT environment for a large infrastructure of similarly purposed computers by discovering temporally and spatially diverse secure configurations.","","978-1-4673-0402-3","10.1109/SafeConfig.2011.6111663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6111663","","Computers;Biological cells;Security;Genetic algorithms;Computational modeling;Hamming distance;Diversity reception","configuration management;genetic algorithms;security of data","moving target environment;genetic algorithms;computer systems;security;temporal diversity;periodic configuration changes;secure computer configurations","","16","1","12","IEEE","26 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking thunderstorm as an example, this paper analyzes the mechanisms of natural disasters affecting power systems. The required data are discussed and an early-warning method is proposed based on data provided by a lighting location system. Firstly according to the proposed criteria, the thunder locations detected within the current interval are grouped into areas; secondly the results are matched with those of the previous interval; finally the most possible thunder areas can be estimated for the next several intervals. Unlike traditional models with annual average probability of thunder-striking faults, the proposed real-time probability model which considers real-time information is space dependent, as well as time dependent. Instead of being fixed, the list of preassigned faults to be on-line assessed is time varying. Thus, the task of online security analysis is adaptive and more efficient.","","978-1-4577-0365-2","10.1109/DRPT.2011.5993862","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5993862","natural disasters;data acquisition;thunderstorm trend analysis;adaptive security assessment","Lighting;Power transmission lines;Flashover;Pollution;Ice;Probability","alarm systems;data acquisition;disasters;power system faults;power system measurement;power system protection;power system security;probability;thunderstorms","power system early-warning defense scheme;wide area meteorological information;natural disaster;data acquisition;microcosmic meteorology data;macroscopic meteorology data;thunderstorm;lighting location system;thunder location detection;thunder-striking fault probability;real-time probability model","","5","","24","IEEE","22 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fountain code has such a characteristic that as long as the legitimate user correctly collects sufficient fountain packets before the malicious user does, information leakage can be voided and secure communication can be realized. Inspired by this insight, we develop a fountain coding mechanism which dynamically adjusts the fountain code construction via the feedback channel. Moreover, transmit power control is employed to enhance the rate of packet reception of the legitimate receiver. We analyse the performance of our scheme in terms of intercept probability and QoS violating probability. Numerical simulations verify our theoretical analysis results, and demonstrate that the proposed scheme enhances the system secrecy and reduces the decoding delay compared with the other previous schemes.","2472-7628","978-1-7281-3555-7","10.1109/WCSP.2019.8927854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8927854","physical layer security;fountain codes;intercept probability;QoS violating probability","Decoding;Delays;Security;Encoding;Wireless communication;Probability;Quality of service","adaptive codes;channel coding;decoding;feedback;probability;telecommunication security","decoding delay;numerical simulations;QoS violating probability;intercept probability;packet reception rate;transmit power control;information leakage avoidance;fountain code construction mechanism;fountain packets;adaptive security transmission scheme;channel feedback;secure communication","","3","","9","IEEE","8 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Streaming refers to downloading software to client hardware platforms for temporary local execution. OS and application software is managed from a centralized server and provided only on-demand. Users obtain a clean, consistent, current build each time they log in, removing the nuisance of security patching and rebooting for environmental changes. Local execution and caching preserves user experience comparable to traditionally installed applications. To explore feasibility, Intel conducted a proof-of-concept (POC) to evaluate streaming in its call center and manufacturing environments on multi-user systems. The four-part study included performance, usability, IT operations and total cost of ownership (TCO). The proof-of-concept was successful in identifying streaming as a feasible technology with good performance and positive TCO in the tested scenarios. The biggest benefits were related to locking down the client and thus eliminating service calls related to configuration changes, software installation and viruses. The major challenges encountered were around the high learning curve and the software maturity related to packing applications for streaming. Based on the strong positive outcome of the POC, Intel has added streaming to its IT roadmaps.","2159-5100","978-1-890843-17-5","10.1109/PICMET.2008.4599691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599691","","Software;Streaming media;Manufacturing;Cities and towns;Africa;Servers;Computational modeling","DP industry","Intel case study;software on demand;software as a service approach;software streaming;proof-of-concept","","","2","","","15 Aug 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Real-time stability assessment is dependent on very fast computation of different properties of the grid operating state, and strict time constraints are difficult to adhere to as the complexity of the grid increases. Several suggested approaches for real-time stability assessment require Thevenin impedances to be determined for the observed system conditions. By combining matrix factorization, graph reduction, and parallelization, an algorithm for computing Thevenin impedances an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches is developed. The factor-and-solve algorithm is tested with data from several power grids of varying complexity, and experiments show how the algorithm allows real-time stability assessment of complex power grids at millisecond time scale.","","978-1-4673-4896-6","10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497824","","Power system stability;Admittance;Real-time systems;Stability analysis;Impedance;Complexity theory;Runtime","distributed power generation;matrix decomposition;power grids;power system security;power system stability;renewable energy sources","power grids;factor-and-solve algorithm;matrix factorization;grid operating state properties;real-time stability assessment;noncontrollable renewable energy sources;distributed energy sources;power production;power system stability operation;power system security operation;real-time Thevenin impedance computation","","21","","27","IEEE","15 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we have implemented the operation of lights through the voice-controlled home automation system by giving voice commands as an input to the system for the user to turn ON and turn OFF the lights at home. The system mainly uses the Raspberry Pi module, which happens to be an important component of our smart light system implementation. It consists of both hardware and software components, which have a speech recognition module implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has voice commands that can be understood, and accordingly, lights can be operated with its usage. It has a special feature that when the light gets turned ON or OFF, it will be ensured to the user through an audio output by the speaker. The main working of a voice-automated system depends on the recognition of the voice given by the user as an input. Raspberry Pi module keeps all electrical home appliances connected through a single interface for complete smart home system automation. Today's modern world is shifting from conventional switches to centralized control systems with less human intervention, as result, the use of manual operating switches is slowly deteriorating. In this paper, we have used voice recognition for operating the home appliances where there is no need to use the conventional switches, and hence human effort required for the system is comparatively very less. Research work on smart home systems mainly aims to satisfy the needs, which help elderly and disabled people etc. in operating home appliances without any helping support from others.

Unfortunately, prior work on configuration errors has largely ignored the security impact of configurations of connected components. To address this gap, we present SCIBORG, a framework that improves the security posture of distributed systems by examining the impact of configuration changes across interdependent components using a graph-based model of the system and its vulnerabilities. It formulates a Constraint Satisfaction Problem from the graph-based model and uses an SMT solver to find optimal configuration parameter values that minimize the impact of attacks while preserving system functionality.

The work presented in this paper focuses on the particular problem of traffic management for emergency services, for which a delay of few minutes may cause human lives risks as well as financial losses. The goal is to reduce the latency of emergency services for vehicles such as ambulances and police cars, with minimum unnecessary disruption to the regular traffic, and preventing potential misuses. To this end, we propose to design a framework in which the Traffic Management System (TMS) may adapt by dynamically adjusting traffic lights, changing related driving policies, recommending behavior change to drivers, and applying essential security controls.

This was driven initially by military requirements for flexibility, but more recently by the commercial pressure to take advantage of economies of scale, reductions in maintenance costs and more efficient utilisation of spectrum. Therefore, initial projects looking at this concept have focussed on the technology for providing multi-mode and software reconfigurable terminals. The Transparently Reconfigurable Ubiquitous Terminal (TRUST) project differs in that it examines the user requirements in order to identify the frameworks and systems that are needed to support software reconfigurable radios from the users' perspective. The primary goal of the TRUST project is to realise the user potential of reconfigurable radio systems, which will provide network connectivity and services when and where they are required. The project will achieve this through a four-step process: (1) understand the users' requirements from their perspective of the system: ""the terminal"" (2) translate these users' requirements into technology requirements (3) advance the terminal and network technologies through research and innovation (4) validate, promote and disseminate these advancements and technologies.","","0-7803-6463-5","10.1109/PIMRC.2000.881582","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=881582","","Software radio;Security;Application software;Software standards;FCC;Europe;Laboratories;Educational institutions;Software testing;Economies of scale","land mobile radio;telecommunication terminals;data communication","IST-TRUST;reconfiguration;future mobile terminals;software download;reconfigurable software radio;Transparently Reconfigurable Ubiquitous Terminal;user requirements;software reconfigurable radios;user potential;network connectivity","","14","9","13","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different methods for image scaling are presented and their impact on the algorithms are measured. We propose an adaptive scaling mechanism, that implies the selection and dynamic adaptive configuration of one of the available hardware engines (interpolators), in order to optimize the power consumption and the bandwidth used for data transmission. The artificial intelligence processing outputs are used as a source for these configuration changes. Besides the optimal decision on enabling the appropriate re-sampling interpolator, the parameters computed (in order to configure this selected hardware block) are the quality of the scaling and the image resolution. The hardware implementation for this mechanism is presented and the measured results are discussed.

Occasional incidents may cause overload problems, voltage problems, and cascading failures. These problems may damage the system stability. Therefore, in the normal state of the system, it is important to study the state transition and its harm to the system through security analysis. Besides, adopting certain control measures to reduce the risk of the system, such as the coordination of prevention and emergency control, is of great significance to both the safety and the economy of the system. In this premise, this paper proposes a risk-based two-layer optimization model for coordination on prevention control and emergency control of quasi-steady state AC-DC system. By introducing a continuous derivable function, the non-derivable constraints in the traditional model are replaced by continuous derivable constraints. The method can greatly improve the computational efficiency of the model. According to the characteristic of the two-layer optimization model, the first layer optimization problem is solved by the golden section method, and the second layer optimization problem is solved by the active and reactive power alternating approach method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified with simulation example.","","978-1-5386-5392-0","10.1109/CIEEC.2018.8745954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8745954","AC-DC system;risk;coordination control;active and reactive power alternating approach method","Power system stability;Mathematical model;Optimization;Stability analysis;Power conversion;Reactive power","AC-DC power convertors;hybrid power systems;optimisation;power system control;power system security;power system stability;reactive power;risk analysis","risk-based two-layer optimization model;quasisteady state AC-DC hybrid system;cascading failures;voltage problems;overload problems;security analysis;continuous derivable function;golden section method;active and reactive power alternating approach method;system stability;emergency control;prevention control;risk-based coordination research","","","","15","IEEE","27 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This arrangement of measures was able to restore the grid to a secure operating state, even with the five lines still out of service. The simulation studies show the effectiveness of a protection arrangement, functioning during the first postdisturbance period, with well-timed measures concentrated only in the region most affected by the disturbance. By limiting the application of measures only to this area, it also prevents any effects of the disturbance from spreading to the remainder of the power grid.<>","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.141782","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=141782","","Power system interconnection;Power system simulation;Voltage;Power system security;Power system stability;Power generation;Power system protection;Power system reliability;Power system dynamics;Power grids","electrical faults;power system interconnection;power system protection;stability","voltage collapse;security;interconnected power systems;simulation;voltage instability;disturbance;grid;protection","","47","","14","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The two existing proposals to date are ART (Cohn-Gordon et al., CCS18) and TreeKEM (IETF, The Messaging Layer Security Protocol, draft). TreeKEM is the currently considered candidate by the IETF MLS working group, but dynamic group operations (i.e. adding and removing users) can cause efficiency issues. In this paper we formalize and analyze a variant of TreeKEM which we term Tainted TreeKEM (TTKEM for short). The basic idea underlying TTKEM was suggested by Millican (MLS mailing list, February 2018). This version is more efficient than TreeKEM for some natural distributions of group operations, we quantify this through simulations.Our second contribution is two security proofs for TTKEM which establish post compromise and forward secrecy even against adaptive attackers. The security loss (to the underlying PKE) in the Random Oracle Model is a polynomial factor, and a quasipolynomial one in the Standard Model. Our proofs can be adapted to TreeKEM as well. Before our work no security proof for any TreeKEM-like protocol establishing tight security against an adversary who can adaptively choose the sequence of operations was known. We also are the first to prove (or even formalize) active security where the server can arbitrarily deviate from the protocol specification. Proving fully active security – where also the users can arbitrarily deviate – remains open.","2375-1207","978-1-7281-8934-5","10.1109/SP40001.2021.00035","European Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9519462","secure-group-messaging;adaptive-security;message-layer-security","Adaptation models;Privacy;Protocols;Subspace constraints;Security;Servers;Proposals","cryptographic protocols;message authentication;polynomials;public key cryptography","Tainted TreeKEM;secure continuous group key agreement;strong security guarantees;similar security guarantees;Messaging Layer Security Protocol;IETF MLS working group;dynamic group operations;TTKEM;security proof;security loss;TreeKEM-like;tight security;proving fully active security","","2","","25","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Probe data from mobile phones provides an important data source for collecting system performance data that can be used as feedback to improve the management of the various transportation and queuing systems used by airport travelers. This paper reports on a study using Bluetooth sensors to quantitatively evaluate the operations of airport security checkpoints. Bluetooth sensors were deployed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport from 30 August to 13 September, 2010 and collected over 100,000 travel time records between data collection stations located along access roads, parking garages, non-sterile areas of terminals, and sterile areas of terminals. In addition, hourly checkpoint passenger volumes were collected. The large volume of this data necessitated the development of statistical characterization procedures and graphics that characterize both the travel time records and checkpoint information. These checkpoint operations reports provide dashboard level reports useful for management to rapidly assess operations, and identify opportunities for improved allocation of staffing. The paper concludes by providing examples of how the checkpoint operations report concept can be extended to characterize the movement of traffic through the airport, the entire passenger arrival experience, and numerically characterize user delay in person-hours. A final overview procedure using pareto sorting to identify correctable periods where airports have opportunity to improve their utilization is shown.","2153-0017","978-1-4799-2914-6","10.1109/ITSC.2013.6728411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6728411","","Airports;Security;Delays;Bars","airports;Bluetooth;data analysis;pedestrians;security","multimodal airport land side probe data;Bluetooth enabled mobile devices;data analysis;data collection;Bluetooth sensors;airport security checkpoint operations;George Bush Intercontinental Airport;hourly checkpoint passenger volumes;dashboard level reports;travel time records;checkpoint information","","3","","12","IEEE","30 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A chaotic generator has been used to increase the randomness and robustness of generated key-streams. The proposed architecture was implemented on Xilinx virtex-S FPGA technology and its security was evaluated using many security tests (generated key-stream distribution, key sensitivity, key space, and NIST statistical tests). The experimental results show that the proposed design allows to encrypt data in two operating modes (SNOW-3G and ZUC modes) using limited hardware resources and power consumption while ensuring more resistance against cryptanalysis attacks.","","978-1-5386-4683-0","10.1109/CyberSecPODS.2018.8560677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560677","SNOW-3G stream cipher;ZUC stream cipher;Robustness;Mobile security;Chaotic generator;NIST statistical analysis;Key sensitivity;Key space;Cryptanalysis;FPGA implementation","","3G mobile communication;chaotic communication;cryptography;field programmable gate arrays;Long Term Evolution;statistical testing;telecommunication security","chaotic system;stream ciphers;3GPP organization;3rd Generation Partnership Project;enhanced algorithm;standard SNOW-3G;LTE network;chaotic generator;security tests;key sensitivity;key space;Xilinx Virtex-S FPGA technology;robust SNOW-ZUC algorithm;combined SNOW-ZUC algorithm;Long Term Evolution;LTE network security;generated key-stream distribution;NIST statistical tests;data enryption;hardware resources;cryptanalysis attacks;radio network security","","3","","28","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Solutions for enabling information security in BANs require extensive use of cryptographic primitives that involve considerable performance overhead. Consequently, information security is typically not available in wearable technologies. We need adaptive security solutions that increase the level of security in the event of threats but otherwise impose minimal security overhead in order for them to viable for BANs. The first step in building adaptive security for BANs is to detect the threats. In this paper we propose a solution for detecting adversaries attacking the communication channel of a BAN called a wearable honeypot system. It works by communicating fake user health information between the base station and a set of designated decoy nodes in the BAN. Any alteration of this traffic, in content or arrival time, is considered adversarial tampering. A preliminary implementation of this wearable honeypot system demonstrates that it is effective in detecting a variety of communication attacks on a BAN.","","978-1-5090-1540-5","10.1109/SARNOF.2016.7846755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7846755","","Base stations;Accelerometers;Security;Biomedical monitoring;Communication channels;Peer-to-peer computing;Monitoring","body area networks;telecommunication security","adversarial tampering;wearable honeypot system;information security;body area network;wearable networks","","","","8","IEEE","9 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accordingly, a high throughput, low latency Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure should be opted in this regard. Due to the low cost, low power profile, dynamic nature, improved accuracy and scalability, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be a good choice. Yet, the efficiency of a WSN depends a lot on the network design and the routing technique. In this paper a new design of the ICT network for smart grid using WSN is proposed. In order to understand the interactions between different entities, detect their operational levels, design the routing scheme and identify false data injection by particular ICT entities, a new model of interdependency called the Multi State Implicative Interdependency Model (MSIIM) is proposed in this paper, which is an updated version of the Modified Implicative Interdependency Model (MIIM) [1]. MSIIM considers the data dependency and operational accuracy of entities together with structural and functional dependencies between them. A multi-path secure routing technique is also proposed in this paper which relies on the MSIIM model for its functioning.

In this paper, three topology control (corrective transmission switching) methodologies are presented along with the detailed formulation of robust corrective switching. By incorporating robust optimization into the corrective switching framework, the switching solution is guaranteed to be feasible for a range of system operating states. The robust model can be solved offline to suggest switching actions that can be used in a dynamic security assessment tool in real-time. The proposed robust topology control algorithm can also generate multiple corrective switching actions for a particular contingency.

A digital twin (DT) is a virtual representation of a real-time counterpart of a physical world. DT offers significant advantages to cybersecurity experts, empowering them to predict risks without entering the physical world, and to simulate and test cyber-attacks that would otherwise be infeasible to do in real-time in the physical environment. DT in healthcare helps to identify security vulnerabilities, conduct attack simulations, and potential security breaches by creating a virtual replica of the targeted healthcare systems.

Achieving these goals would require software development, management, and operation platforms that support elasticity, diversity, awareness, cooperation, and intelligence. In this paper, we propose CyberX, a situation-aware trustworthy management platform. CyberX utilizes our Cell Oriented Architecture (COA) capability that separates the main design concerns: data, logic and physical resources to employ runtime diversity via hot shuffling of similar-function different-quality-objective code variants. CyberX employs such diversity to modify the application implicit behavior at runtime utilizing autonomous execution elasticity and adaptability. Further, CyberX enhances application resilience against failures and attacks via multi-mode recovery and real-time, context- and situation-aware adjustment of shuffling and recovery policies. Using analysis and simulation, results show that CyberX-managed COA-based software systems can efficiently adapt to maintain the desired performance and resilience objectives even in hazardous, unstable environments at a reasonable overhead.","","978-1-4673-2740-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6450965","software management platform;system diversity;moving target defense;biologically-inspired software architecture;resilience;hot shuffling","Cryptography;Biological system modeling;Adaptation models;Resilience;Runtime;Reliability","security of data;software engineering;trusted computing","biologically-inspired platform;cyber trust management;infrastructure assets;cyber attacks;trace-resistant moving target defense;autonomous trustworthy cooperative defense;software development;situation-aware trustworthy management platform;cell oriented architecture;hot shuffling;different-quality-objective code variants;application resilience;CyberX-managed COA-based software systems","","","2","14","","7 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud computing is ubiquitous, next generation's in-formation technology architecture which offers on-demand access to the network. It is dynamic, virtualized, scalable and pay per use model over internet. In a cloud computing environment, a cloud service provider offers “house of resources” includes applications, data, runtime, middleware, operating system, virtualization, servers, data storage and sharing and networking and tries to take up most of the overhead of client. Cloud computing offers lots of benefits, but the journey of the cloud is not very easy. It has several pitfalls along the road because most of the services are outsourced to third parties with added enough level of risk. Cloud computing is suffering from several issues and one of the most significant is Security, privacy, service availability, confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and compliance. Security is a shared responsibility of both client and service provider and we believe security must be information centric, adaptive, proactive and built in. Cloud computing and its security are emerging study area nowadays.

Also, for configuration interfaces to be remotely accessible, corporate networks need to be configured accordingly to provide access possibilities. Such additional access possibilities might then be used by adversaries when attacking corporate networks and thus, are often seen as a security weakness. If ICPS are not updated, outdated configurations also lead to security weaknesses.

Security of online e-commerce over the Internet is provided through Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS). The SSL/TLS uses public key cryptographic algorithms which are computational intensive due to the modular multiplications. Therefore, SSL/TLS servers often become overloaded while performing public key decryptions when the simultaneous requests increase rapidly. Overload can lead e-commerce applications to considerable revenue losses, response times may grow to unacceptable levels and as a result the server may saturate even crash. So load management of SSL/TLS web server is a critical issue in e-commerce. The proposed work in this paper is to manage load on the server by applying Adaptive SSL policy and session handling mechanism. This policy is self-adaptive security, which offers great potential in providing timely and fine grained security control on server, by runtime adaptation of cryptographic algorithm.

However, the increasing integration of the 6G network with the physical world leads to a plethora of new scenarios that bring new challenges to 6G, especially from the security and energy aspects. In 5G networks, security solutions across all devices and base stations are configured with universal settings for certain types of attacks. This one-size-fit-all strategy no longer suits 6G security due to the higher diversity in device capabilities, service features, energy conditions, attack vulnerabilities, and other time-varying attributes. Since each scenario may have unique security requirements and energy availability, the selection and configuration of security strategies need to be optimized for 6G networks in an adaptive and dynamic manner. In this article, we explore 6G security from an energy efficiency perspective by balancing the tradeoff between security and energy consumption in various scenarios. Specifically, we first investigate the AI-empowered 6G network architecture with promising applications and visions. Then we identify the challenges for adaptive and dynamic security optimization in 6G from the aspects of heterogeneity, dynamics, and modeling complexity. To balance security-energy trade-off, we propose an optimization framework that provides customized recommendations of security strategy to different user devices and base stations.

An active power system (APS) may have a great variety of diverse operating conditions that effectively prevent any visual recognition and manual control of its operating modes; besides, they require automatic real-time process control. Such circumstances call for adjustments in the requirements to the structure of communication networks, metering and instrumentation systems, power system protections, monitoring and control systems. The algorithms that are used by phasor measurement units (PMU) and PMU-based smart devices (SD) to estimate current and voltage parameters are of fundamental importance. Active power systems are more demanding with respect to electric power quality and measurement accuracy. Calculations herein show the need to lower the allowable margin of voltage and current error in PMUs, as the existing requirements are not consistent with the functioning of active power systems. The paper analyzes how signals are processed digitally when there are short frequency fluctuations in a wide dynamic range, and how distortion factors affect the sine wave of currents and voltages.","","978-1-6654-3316-7","10.1109/USSEC53120.2021.9655728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9655728","Active power system;distributed generation;phasor measurement unit;smart device;digital signal processing;electric power quality;measurement accuracy","Automatic frequency control;Voltage measurement;Power measurement;Instruments;Process control;Phasor measurement units;Automatic voltage control","distributed power generation;electric current measurement;energy conservation;energy security;energy storage;phasor measurement;power engineering computing;power supply quality;power system control;power system protection;process control;signal processing;voltage measurement","active power system;active customer-side power system;energy storage systems;metering systems;instrumentation systems;power system protections;control systems;electric power quality;ESS;allowable current error;allowable voltage error;integrated distributed generation;energy security;primary energy resources;secondary energy resources;energy efficiency;energy conservation;APS;visual recognition;manual control;automatic real-time process control;communication networks;monitoring systems;phasor measurement units;PMU-based smart devices;current parameters;voltage parameters;sine wave;signal processing","","","","22","IEEE","31 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, most discovery tools use manually written rules, which require specific knowledge of software and systems. Approaches based on manually written rules are often fragile and require constant maintenance in this era of continuous integration. In this paper, we propose a novel “discovery by example” approach to autonomously search for and identify system changes. Our approach learns characteristic features of system changes automatically, without requiring any explicit rule definitions or specific knowledge of the underlying software or systems. In this approach, given a system change, our method searches a repository that contains previous stored system changes and returns those that are similar to it. We further explore the use of various forms of “fingerprints” to represent system changes efficiently and faithfully in a compact manner. We propose and evaluate two types of fingerprints: the “basename fingerprint” and the “1-D histogram fingerprint”. We show that both fingerprints exhibit different efficiency and accuracy trade-offs, and they can be effectively employed in different use cases. We evaluate the performance of our approach with both techniques and further present an application of it in system real-time streaming monitoring.","","978-1-4799-5666-1","10.1109/BigData.2014.7004217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004217","","Software;Histograms;Fingerprint recognition;Feature extraction;Big data;Security;Monitoring","computer centres;software packages","software installation;security patches;cloud platforms;base-name fingerprint;1-D histogram fingerprint","","7","","18","IEEE","8 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, In-band Network Telemetry (INT) has presented its unique capabilities in acquiring the insights of a network and thus has been adopted in many production networks. However, less attention was put on the potential threats on INT (e.g., the man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojan horse injection) that may falsify network measurements resulting in catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose a secure INT architecture called SINT that can effectively mitigate INT vulnerabilities and can be implemented using ‘chiplet’ based multi-modal network processors (MNP). SINT adopts blockchain technology into INT, in which a network status snapshot acquired via INT is viewed as a block and added into a network telemetry blockchain to prevent arbitrary access and malicious modification. To minimize the intrusiveness of the INT and blockchain operations, SINT is designed to be a lightweight protocol and uses improved RAFT consensus mechanisms to reduce its network and computing overhead. The design of the chiplet MNP system makes SINT highly flexible and adaptive to facilitate INT convergence and related blockchain updates. In the SINT architecture, INT tasks and blockchain operations are dispatched to different chips to achieve an optimal trade-off among measurement accuracy, security requirements, and computing resource on the data plane. Experiments and simulations show that SINT can alleviate most cyberattacks on INT and retain 97% of bandwidth utilization for other users’ normal traffic in a complex scenario with 500 nodes. Furthermore, SINT converges the INT results quickly and accurately with minor overhead compared to that of the state-of-art INT methods.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2023.3269891","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1800602); China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022M710677); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10107633","INT;blockchain;multi-modal network processor;security","Blockchains;Telemetry;Computer architecture;Security;Current measurement;Control systems;Task analysis","blockchains;computer network security;invasive software;security of data;telemetry","blockchain operations;blockchain technology;blockchain-based;chiplet based multimodal network processors;In-Band Network Telemetry Architecture;INT convergence;INT results;INT tasks;INT vulnerabilities;managed network;network management;network measurements;network status snapshot;network telemetry blockchain;production networks;related blockchain updates;secure INT architecture;SINT architecture;state-of-art INT methods","","","","50","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Basing on this, we can alarm and prevent the outage to assure the safety and reliability of the power system. Traditional reliability is an expected value of long-term reliability level under the fixed operating mode, which cannot reflect the real time reliability level under the current operational state. This essay presents the novel conception and algorithm of online evaluating the short-term reliability in order to study the operational reliability level. The influence of the variable system states on the reliability level is reflected according to the real time operational information provided by the SCADA/EMS/WAMS. Markov process is adopted to solve the transient state probability of the components, so that forecasting the system state basing on the transient probability is possible. The probability of the system state and the reliability indices of the system changes as the time varying. The analysis and the assessment of IEEE RTS-79 system indicates that there are great differences between the short-term and long-term reliability indices, and only the transient probability evaluation can assess the short-term probability properly. In this paper the relationship between the enumerating number of the system states and the forecasting time is also studied. The result indicates that only a few system states are needed to get relative high degree of evaluation accuracy, which can be applied online.

This method is further implemented by FPGA hardware, such that the performances of real-time and security of the control network are both guaranteed.

In this manner, multi-modal biometric generates more interest than a single biometric identification system. Researchers are interested in multimodal biometric systems' certificates because, compared to those of a unimodal biometric system, they offer advantages like improved accuracy in recognition competence and dependable security. Here, a Hand vein and Iris based multimodal Fingerprint system is designed with Deep Learning. Encrypting the alignment maintaining characteristics, the hand vein based method aims to be more robustly tolerant of the possible fractures, rotating, and translational shifts. As a step towards Palm Vein Identification, a picture processing method is used to examine the vascular pattern of the hand palm vein. Iris biometrics were integrated into the authentication process to further strengthen its reliability. An infrared camera or scanner device is used to collect the palm vein pattern, and this data is then put through four distinct filters.

The former issues are typically addressed by optimizing key factors, such as iris size, image quality and acquisition wavelength. As for the latter, introducing error correction codes to reduce intra-user variability in the enrolled identifiers becomes novelly promising. This paper proposes a conventional iris authentication system and a hardware-friendly QC-LDPC error correction code scheme on a microprocessor-FPGA platform. Different QC-LDPC codes in IEEE 802.16e were analyzed and selected. Suitable codes were applied, followed by the evaluation experiments. The proposed design achieves a competitive result with up to 0.20% EER and 0.50% ZeroFAR on the CASIA-IrisV4-Syn database. Cryptographic keys with lengths of up to 288 bits can also be generated and recovered. Such a device can be potentially used for applications such as an access control system in high-security areas, identity verification at the borders, biometric cryptography and related authentication scenarios.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3133908","Exploration Squared Limited (ES Ltd.), New Zealand; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9642996","Iris authentication;biometric;error correction codes;LDPC;QC-LDPC;FPGA;dynamic partial reconfiguration","Iris recognition;Codes;Biometrics (access control);Field programmable gate arrays;Error correction codes;Authentication;Decoding","biometrics (access control);cryptography;error correction codes;field programmable gate arrays;image coding;iris recognition;microprocessor chips;parity check codes","IEEE 802.16e;CASIA-IrisV4-Syn database;cryptographic keys;access control system;related authentication scenarios;effective multimode iris authentication system;microprocessor-FPGA heterogeneous platform;iris biometrics;iris authentication systems;corresponding variability reduction methods;iris size;image quality;acquisition wavelength;error correction codes;intra-user variability;enrolled identifiers;conventional iris authentication system;hardware-friendly QC-LDPC error correction code scheme;microprocessor-FPGA platform;QC-LDPC codes;storage capacity 288.0 bit","","1","","49","CCBY","8 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

REGNs can reduce the operating cost of a MG; they also affect the operating states of the connected grids, especially the voltages. The larger the power generation of REGNs, the greater the impact on voltage of MGs. Therefore, the power generation of a REGN in a MG should be limited for the grid security. In the current study the binary search method is employed to determine the maximum power generation of REGNs in an islanded MG considering the current and voltage limits. The algorithm for determining the maximum power generation of a REGN without violating the current and voltage limits is presented.

Current protocols and applications allow significant changes to a system to take place within a short time or small network footprint, which can be exploited by attackers to cause a great impact on the physical systems. This paper proposes adaptive Commensurate Response (CR) to narrow down the asymmetry between the cost of attacks and their impact through enforcing command footprints to be commensurate with their impact on the system. Such impact is measured by the change of the setpoint (change-driven CR) or the distance between the operating state and the critical state (criticality-driven CR). Change-driven CR is effective for setpoint attacks with big setpoint changes, and criticality-driven CR can be used to combat both setpoint attacks and actuation attacks. Our case study on automobile cruise control demonstrates that CR can effectively improve the system resilience and attack survivability while satisfying QoS requirements.","","978-1-5386-0683-4","10.1109/CNS.2017.8228641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8228641","Cyber-Physical Systems;SCADA;Commensurate Response;Industrial Control Systems;PLC","Security;Cruise control;Temperature measurement;Steady-state;Communication networks;Fault tolerance","cyber-physical systems;security of data","adaptive commensurate response;command footprints;setpoint attacks;actuation attacks;system resilience;attack survivability;power systems;medical systems;critical infrastructures;network footprint;attackers;cyber-physical systems;change-driven CR;criticality-driven CR;automobile cruise control;QoS requirements","","7","","37","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we develop a deep learning based methodology for detection, localization, and data recovery of FDIA on power systems in a coherent and holistic manner. However, the multi-modal probability distributions of both measurements and state variables in SE due to ever-changing operating points and structural/topological changes pose great challenges in detecting and localizing FDIA. To address this challenge, we first propose an enhanced attack model to launch massive FDIA on limited access points. Second, we train an auto-encoder (AE) with a Bayesian change verification (BCV) classifier using $N-1$ contingencies to detect FDIA with unseen $N-k$ operational topologies. Third, to avoid model collapse caused by multi-modal measurement distribution, an AE-based generative adversarial network (GAN) is derived to generate a diverse candidate set of normal measurement vectors with various operational topologies. Finally, we develop a pattern match algorithm to localize and recover the falsified measurements and state variables by comparing the falsified measurement vectors with the normal measurement vectors in the candidate set. Case studies with IEEE benchmark systems and a modified 415-bus China Southern Grid system are provided to validate the proposed methodology.

Given the trend toward interconnecting OT and IT networks for business reasons, and given the disclosure of highly sophisticated attacks against OT environments, OT network operators increasingly recognize the need to deploy security solutions that are widely known in IT also to OT. OT networks are running critical control processes. Configuration changes are avoided to reduce the risk of misconfiguration or unforeseeable side effects detrimental to the network's operation. Therefore, passive non-intrusive security technologies are favored. Consequently, security intelligence applied to passively collected network data is the most acceptable technology to be deployed in OT networks. In this paper, we show how IT-specific security intelligence techniques can be applied to passively collected OT network data.

Modern industrial processes leverage advanced IT technologies to increase productivity and often combine multiple system concepts such as Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and Cloud Computing. Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPS) are key enablers of this revolution. In CPPS, raw materials, machines, and operations are interconnected to form a sophisticated network. Protecting them against advanced cyber-threats is a priority concern for the future implementation of Industry 4.0 applications. Any impairment of such systems can lead, in fact, to catastrophic damages resulting in a substantial financial loss for governments, companies, as well as endanger the safety of the society. The need for high availability and reliability of these systems is therefore the pillar guiding our research. This paper proposes the adoption of anomaly detection as a method to support self-adaptation in CPPS and to ensure flexibility, reliability, and protection of industrial environments against modern cyber threats. An anomaly detection mechanism can be employed to monitor, and learn the normal behavior of an industrial system, and to generate alerts when the observed events indicate abnormal activities. On this concept we base our work, and we demonstrate how timely identifying critical security events can enable, through the self-adaptation (e.g., triggering automatic configuration changes), an efficient protection of the CPPS against advanced threats, and an effective containment of their effects.","","978-1-5386-6531-2","10.1109/ICPHYS.2018.8387655","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387655","Cyber Physical Production Systems;Self-adaptation;Anomaly Detection;Industry 4.0","Security;Monitoring;Anomaly detection;Measurement;Industries;Sensors;Planning","cloud computing;cyber-physical systems;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;security of data;self-adjusting systems","anomaly detection mechanism;productivity;IoT;Internet of Things;CPPS self-adaptation;Industry 4.0;cyber physical production systems protection;cloud computing;industrial processes;fourth industrial revolution;financial loss;cyber-threats","","18","","19","IEEE","21 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the statistical data, more than sixty percentages of the synchronous generator faults are the excitation system faults, which might cause loss of load, tie-line tripping, instability, collapse and etc. Therefore, it is crucial to identify loss of field as early as possible and take countermeasures. In loss of field protection, the impedance boundary criterion of steady state stability limit is widely used to distinguish loss of field and normal condition. However, the steady state stability limit circle is affected by the system operating modes, which might result in mis-operation of the relay.

Hence, intelligent robots have diverse applications in domains such as security, automation, industry and agriculture. Such robots when used for surveillance or spying operations by military or police forces are called spybots. This paper aims to highlight the need and importance of developing systems that have the ability to remotely control their functions, response and operation, using multiple-controls and commands given by multiple-modalities. As an example, to give a live physical demonstration of the proposed concepts, a prototype smart spybot is developed. The prototype spybot can be controlled using multi-modalities such as text, touch, speech and gestures. It can be remotely operated using an application running on an Android based smart-phone, or a website, or an interactive program running on a laptop. Each can be connected by wires or wirelessly. The prototype spybot also has decision making capability and obstacle-avoidance feature. It is GPS enabled, and can be used as a tracker also. This intelligent spybot can directly fetch the live-video feeds and the spied data to a website, along with GPS coordinates. Since the prototype spybot is speech and gesture-enabled, it can also be used effectively by the people having restricted physical abilities.

However, it is often viewed as difficult to use due to the elaborate configuration that is needed to ensure correct (and secure) operation. In this paper, we seek to answer the question of how to build IPsec VPNs without affecting the network assets. We exploit ""repeater-encryption"", which is similar to the IPsec bump-in-the-wire mode of operation. Our IPsec encryption unit works at Layer-2 of the network stack and does not encrypt control packets that are used for routing, address resolution and resource reservation. Although this is fairly straightforward for IPv4 networks, IPv6 introduces several new features and messages that complicate the operation of such a box. We report our findings of implementing transparent, repeater-based IPsec protection for IPv4 and IPv6. Our approach requires no configuration changes to other devices in the network, making it an attractive mechanism for security network traffic. We discuss the features of our IPsec encryption unit and show how it adapts to IPv4 and IPv6 networks. We also implement our approach on the OpenBSD IPsec stack to demonstrate its feasibility. We show that our transparent IPsec box can easily support speeds in excess of 100 Mbps.","2332-5798","1-4244-0000-7","10.1109/ICON.2005.1635498","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1635498","","Repeaters;Cryptography;Bridges;Protection;Computer science;Virtual private networks;Routing;Data security;Protocols;Communication system traffic control","cryptography;telecommunication security;IP networks","repeater encryption unit;1Pv4 networks;1Pv6 networks;IPsec;network communications security;repeater-encryption;IPsec encryption unit","","1","1","11","IEEE","19 Jun 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since EHRs are very sensitive, they are always encrypted before being outsourced, which makes retrieval of target EHRs by either identity or attribute value hard. Moreover, the EHRs are encrypted by different doctors, a researcher, who is delegated to research a certain kind of disease, cannot find out all corresponding EHRs due to the difference of encryption keys. In this article, we construct a triple dictionary index structure for the attribute-value type database to allow a researcher to retrieve encrypted EHRs by the identity and attribute value and to perform dynamic operations over them. We employ an identity server to assist doctors in generating encryption keys via an oblivious way.

The successful utilization of DSRs relies heavily upon the infrastructure of advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs). Notably, ICT systems may suffer from cyber attacks and communication latency, which could result in the malfunctions of DSRs and consequently bring adverse impacts on the reliability of power systems. In this paper, a novel operating reliability evaluation framework for multi-state power systems with DSRs and wind power considering malfunctions of cyber systems is proposed. For avoiding increasing complexity caused by multiple system states, an analytic method based on Lz transform technique is proposed to achieve dynamic system reliability. The reliability model for a typical hierarchical decentralized control infrastructure in demand side considering cyber attacks and communication latency is first proposed. Then, reserve capacity from DSRs considering stochastic behavior under the cyber infrastructure is modelled. Moreover, multi-state models for power generation systems with stochastic wind power and conventional generation are developed considering cyber malfunctions. Reliability indices based on load curtailment by conducting optimal power flow for various system states are utilized for reliability assessment. A modified IEEE RTS with four cases is adopted to validate the proposed model and method, which denotes that reserve capacity from DSRs can definitely enhance system operating reliability and affected by proportions of DSRs, consideration of cyber malfunctions, actual committed time for DSRs and initial system conditions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992636","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019TQ0090); National Social Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:19ZDA081); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086434","Operating reliability evaluation;DSRs;cyber security;cyber attacks;communication latency;Lz~transform method","Reliability;Transforms;Power system reliability;Cyberattack;Wind power generation","demand side management;load flow;optimisation;power engineering computing;power generation reliability;security of data;stochastic processes;wind power plants","operating reliability evaluation framework;cyber malfunctions;initial system conditions;system operating reliability;reliability assessment;optimal power flow;reliability indices;stochastic wind power;power generation systems;multistate models;cyber infrastructure;reliability model;dynamic system reliability;multiple system states;cyber systems;multistate power systems;communication latency;cyber attacks;ICT systems;high wind power penetration;reserve capacity;DSRs;demand-side resources","","3","","33","CCBY","5 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This omnipresence as well as the wireless nature of many embedded applications give rise to the need for sophisticated security and privacy preserving mechanisms. Trusted Computing is a promising new approach for computer security in which a system should be permanently in a well-defined and therefore trustworthy state. The adaption of such concepts for embedded systems with application specific requirements and limitations can provide promising security benefits. Besides, both in the industrial and academical sector a trend has become apparent to develop chips which include programmable cores as well as system reconfigurable components. Resultant chips will not be a single part of an embedded system anymore but rather can be used for the development of a whole system. Thus, FPGAs have become integral parts of embedded computing platforms. The reconfigurability of FPGAs offers major advantages when using them for cryptographic applications and it is suggested that an adaptive hardware-based trust anchor can greatly enhance the overall security level of an embedded system.

Since most of the biometric systems only use one modality, it may cause issues such as noise in sensed data, intra-class differences, and similarities between classes, etc. In order to avoid some problems i.e., universality and security purposes multi-modal biometrics are proposed in this work. Multi-modal biometrics uses more than one modality for recognition. Various fusion techniques, including feature level, score level, decision level, etc., will be used to carry out these biometric recognition systems. In this study, we will put into practice a multi-modal biometric face and fingerprint identification system employing feature level fusion. The stages involved in building this system are, firstly it details the preprocessing techniques for both face and fingerprint and then the VGG16 model is built to carry out the further process i.e., extracting the individual features and then the individual model's features are classified using the support vector classifier SVC and got the accuracy of 90% for face and 93% for fingerprint.

Multi-modal biometric systems are commonly believed to be intrinsically more robust to spoof attacks, but recent works have shown that they can be evaded by spoofing even a single biometric trait. This result was however obtained under the worst-case scenario that the attacker is able to fabricate an exact replica of the genuine biometric trait, which was simulated by assuming that the matching score distribution of fake traits is identical to the one of genuine users. This demands for a more thorough investigation of the robustness of multi-modal biometric systems against realistic spoof attacks, namely under non-worst case scenarios. In this paper we focus on bi-modal systems made up of a face and a fingerprint matcher, whose scores are fused using the well-known sum, product, weighted sum and likelihood ratio (LLR) rules. We evaluate their robustness against realistic spoof attacks obtained by fabricating fake biometric traits. The main goal of our study is to investigate whether a realistic spoof attack against both modalities can allow the attacker to crack the multimodal system. Our results show that even in a realistic, non-worst case scenario, the false acceptance rate (FAR) can remarkably increase.","","978-1-4577-0766-7","10.1109/BIOMS.2011.6053682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6053682","","Face;Robustness;Biometrics;Three dimensional displays;Security;Face recognition;Cameras","authorisation;fingerprint identification;fraud","spoof attack;fake biometric trait;security;multimodal biometric system;matching score distribution;bimodal system;fingerprint matcher;likelihood ratio rule;false acceptance rate","","10","","21","IEEE","31 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The key solution to achieve this goal is to integrate multiple avionic systems, apply new signal processing and RF capabilities. A generalized and reconfigurable architecture of Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) with integrated and modularised structure based on Direct RF Sampling (DRFS) and Software Defined Radio (SDR) is presented in this paper for avionic applications. The proposed architecture is composed of a DRFS digital receiver integrated within a SDR software modules. DRFS technology is adopted in the digital receiver, which consists of Pre-selection Filters and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to provide flexible compatibility for diverse modulation modes and various RF/IF frequency bands. By employing the concept of DRFS/SDR, distinct procedures for different avionic purposes, such as Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) and Instrument Landing System (ILS), can be achieved in the same hardware platform. Notably, this proposed architecture has the potential to be reconfigured and improved in several ways without any hardware change to accommodate new features and signal capabilities. As per experimental validation phase, an MMR integrated system for VOR and ILS receivers has been designed and implemented. Test results have illustrated that the implementation feasibility of multi-mode DRFS avionic receivers is beneficial and efficient using the proposed architecture. Moreover, the benefits obtained from this new approach are not only covering miniaturization, lightweight, and low power consumption but is also promising to overreach the equivalent commercial systems in the future.","2375-5318","978-1-4673-8823-8","10.1109/RADAR.2017.7944467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7944467","Avionic;DRFS;SDR;MMR;IMA;VHF;VOR;ILS","Aerospace electronics;Receivers;Radio frequency;Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Band-pass filters;Mixers","avionics;instrument landing systems;radio receivers;software radio","direct RF sampling;avionic systems;VOR;ILS receiver;aerospace industry;avionic architecture;cost reduction;weight reduction;maintenance complexity;RF efficiency;signal processing;generalized architecture;reconfigurable architecture;multimode receiver;MMR;integrated structure;modularised structure;software defined radio;SDR;DRFS digital receiver;SDR software modules;pre-selection filters;field programmable gate arrays;FPGA;flexible compatibility;diverse modulation modes;RF-IF frequency bands;very-high-frequency omnidirectional range;instrument landing system;hardware platform;MMR integrated system;multimode DRFS avionic receivers;power consumption","","6","","16","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Security is important in data protection so as not to be infringed by unauthorized parties. If the vulnerabilities found are not amended, it leads to cyber-attacks such as Structured Query Language Injection Attack (SQLIA) performed by certain parties which enable them to gain unauthorized data access. To cater security issues, variety of security frameworks for secure software development life cycle (SDLC) were introduced. Secure SDLC is created by integrating security-related activities to an each phase of in used development methodologies such as waterfall model or agile model. However, the application security problem continues to grow. Strict, complicated and heavyweight frameworks are underutilized due to several factors. The factors that influence the implementation of secure SDLC identified in public sector (the scope is State Secretary Offices in Malaysia) are inadequate development timeline, improper development team size and less awareness of team members' workload. It is agreed that integrating security at earlier (requirement and design) phase is the most effective and cheapest way to develop secure web application. Hence, an adaptive secure SDLC model is proposed to integrate security activities using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) focusing on the influence factors as the main criteria and meet the international and local secure frameworks standards. The proposed model will recommend adaptive security activities as a guideline to be applied at earlier phases of SDLC to help eliminate/ minimize the web application vulnerabilities and increase the application security and implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype at selected Malaysian public sector for in-house web application development.","","978-1-5386-6925-9","10.1109/AINS.2018.8631401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8631401","web application;security activities;secure SDLC;in-house web application development;public sector","Security;Software;NIST;Information technology;Testing","analytic hierarchy process;data protection;fuzzy set theory;Internet;security of data;software engineering;SQL","structured query language injection attack;software development life cycle;Malaysian public sector;SQLIA;waterfall model;FAHP;fuzzy analytic hierarchy process;agile model;health organizations;financial organizations;in-house web application development;local secure frameworks standards;international frameworks standards;adaptive secure SDLC model;unauthorized data access;cyber-attacks;data protection","","","","46","IEEE","3 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the load limit verification, select the load with large peak-to-valley difference and photovoltaic and hydropower data with small peak-to-valley difference, and perform load-limit verification by fitting the hydropower data.

IOV is an integrated service system that can support the applications for automatic driving, intelligent transport and information services. As the number of incidents on IOV has been on the rise in the past few years, IOV security is becoming increasingly important in the IOV architecture. One of the most notable risks of IOV faces is intelligent terminal security. The vehicle's intelligent terminal can be used to launch for further attacks on the on-board operating system to penetrate into the internal network of connected vehicle, and consequently threaten the safety of the vehicle. Thus, it is of paramount importance that we protect the security of the intelligent terminal. We propose two intelligent terminal based privacy-preserving multi-modal implicit authentication protocols to protect the security of the intelligent terminal in IOV. The proposed protocols use the password and the vehicle owner's behavior features as the authentication factors to protect the security of the intelligent terminal. Since the vehicle owner's behavior features are sensitive and the privacy information of the user must be protected, we also consider the privacy protection of the behavior features. Our protocols do not reveal any information about the vehicle owner's behavior features to the authentication server and the adversary except the ciphertext size of the feature vector. We analyze the security of our proposed protocol and compare them with other related protocols in terms of computation and communications costs.

The share in volatile energy sources connected through power electronic components increases, whereas the installed power of grid-connected generators and associated inertia decreases. In this context, critical operating states up to system blackouts, that threaten the security of supply and the access to electical energy, might occur. In order to restore the grid after a blackout in an efficient way, this paper proposes an advanced control concept for high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems using voltage source converters (VSC) in grid-forming mode. VSC-HVDC systems open new restoration paths and offer the possibility to involve healthy grid areas form a far distance to take part in the restoration process. To benefit from the potential of renewable energy sources and energy storage devices to support the process, established restoration strategies are extended by the consistent integration of power electronics and intelligent control schemes. The presented model predictive controller (MPC) enables precise voltage reference tracking inside the restoration area to ensure a grid compatible voltage ramp-up process by avoiding undesireable effects, e.g. inrush phenomena of transformers. Moreover, the grid frequency is used as a system-wide parameter that is used as a physical information channel between the grid-forming VSC-HVDC station and further power converters inside the restoration area. In that way, renewable energy sources and storage devices can contribute to speed up the restoration process while guaranteeing system stability.","","978-9-0758-1528-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8515409","Predictive control;Grid-forming;HVDC transmission;Grid restoration;Predictive reference tracking;Dynamic frequency adaption","Voltage control;Power conversion;HVDC transmission;Europe;Capacitors","HVDC power convertors;HVDC power transmission;intelligent control;optimal control;power grids;power system restoration;power transmission control;predictive control;renewable energy sources;voltage-source convertors","renewable energy sources;restoration process;system stability;frequency-adaptive MPC;grid-forming VSC-HVDC systems;optimal voltage reference tracking;grid restoration strategies gain;electrical power grids;volatile energy sources;grid-connected generators;critical operating states;system blackouts;electical energy;advanced control concept;high voltage direct current systems;voltage source converters;grid-forming mode;energy storage devices;power electronics;intelligent control schemes;precise voltage reference;grid compatible voltage ramp-up;grid frequency;system-wide parameter;grid-forming VSC-HVDC station;power converters;power electronic components;VSC-HVDC systems;restoration strategies;model predictive controller","","","","7","","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inspired by the game theory, in this research work, we model the interactions between the attacker and the adaptation manager as a two-player zero-sum Markov game. Using this game-theoretic approach, the adaptation manager can refine its strategies in dynamic attack scenarios by utilizing what has learned from the system's and adversary's actions.

Failures of CPEs can occur in both their cyber and physical parts and may, in both cases, result in significant economic losses, service interruption and, even threats to the environment and the population. Traditionally, safety and security of CPEs are addressed separately, the former dealing with failures in the physical part, the latter with breaches in the cyber part. While physical aging is often accounted for, it is not for the cyber elements although it may have an impact on CPEs controllability, stability and, ultimately, reliability. In this paper, we propose a dynamic reliability assessment framework that embeds a multi-state cyber aging model of literature into a Goal Tree Success Tree-Master Logic Diagram (GTST-MLD) that accounts for both stochastic hardware components failures and cyber aging that may open breaches for cyber attacks to the control system.

This paper proposes an ADMM-based distributed state estimate approach and a Markov attack detection mechanism to address the constraints of traditional state estimate and location of cyber-attacks. First, through separating power grid into many regions, we propose a distributed alternate direction state estimation approach based on multipliers that reduces the power system’s communication and computational expense. Second, by adopting presented combination attack model of false data injection attack and DoS attack, a Markov attack detecting mechanism based on distributed state estimate is developed.

The representation of protection functions greatly enhances the accuracy of the transient stability study and leads to a better understanding of power system states during emergency conditions. Although modeling all of the protective relays within transient stability studies may result in a better estimation of system behavior, representing, updating, and maintaining the protection system data becomes an insurmountable task. Inappropriate or outdated representation of the relays may result in incorrect assessment of the system behavior. This paper presents a systematic method to determine essential relays to be modeled in transient stability studies. The desired approach should identify protective relays that are critical for various operating conditions and contingencies. The proposed strategy is verified as a viable technique based on results obtained from the WECC 179-bus and the IEEE 145-bus test cases, while considering various operating states and contingencies.

MBF are expected to be more reliable due to the presence of multiple independent pieces of biometric traits. The aim of these multibiometric systems is to achieve a high reliability to determine or verify person's identity. The motivation for using fuzzy logic is that it offers methods best suited to model the information that is inherently uncertain and ambiguous.

To prevent such attacks, presentation attack detection (PAD) techniques have been proposed in the last decade. For the particular case of fingerprints, most approaches are based on conventional optical or capacitive sensors, acquiring a single image, and which can thus detect only a limited number of PAIs. In this work, we present a new multi-modal PAD approach based on a recently developed capture device, which is able to acquire four different types of samples: i) finger photos, ii) finger vein samples, iii) multi-spectral short wave infrared images, and iv) laser speckle contrast image sequence samples.

However, the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant strategies for CGRAs apply either temporal or spatial scheme, including redundancy, periodic detection, workload balancing, and reconfiguration, failing to exploit the feature of dynamic and partial reconfiguration of CGRAs. Also, vulnerable judging circuits and inflexible mode shifting bottleneck the reliability design of fault-tolerant CGRAs. This paper proposes a novel multi-mode fault-tolerant framework for CGRAs, which combines spatial-redundant data-paths with temporal-redundant voters and thus reduces the vulnerable judging circuits while balancing the performance and reliability. This framework can also enable a changing reliability level at runtime via an online configuration transformation method based on pre-compiled patterns. Within the proposed framework, we systematically searched the design space spanning various combinations of the mainstream schemes with a Markov process model to compare the effectiveness and accordingly selected five points as available modes in our design after comprehensive consideration of fault tolerance and time overhead on CGRA. The framework is comprehensively evaluated on a cycle-accurate CGRA simulator, considering both permanent and transient faults. The experimental results show that the fault coverage rate of single transient faults or permanent faults has increased from 71.74% to 93.84%, which means the fault tolerance of the system has been increased by 31.03% compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

To ensure reliable system operation, monitoring, control and protection have to be improved. In this paper, new Hierarchically Coordinated Protection (HCP) approach to mitigate the effects of increased grid complexity on its operation is proposed. The proposed approach utilizes local and wide area measurements and relies on the three HCP framework levels: fault anticipation and prediction, adaptive fault detection, and relay operation correction in case of unwanted tripping. It brings intelligence to the relays at all voltage levels and uses information and statistics from the systems such as weather, lightning, animal and bird migration patterns, component outage history, etc to enhance protection system tripping dependability and security.","","978-1-84919-715-1","10.1049/cp.2012.2039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6521880","adaptive relaying;distributed generation;neural nets;protective relaying;synchronized sampling","","distributed power generation;power distribution faults;power distribution protection;power distribution reliability;power generation faults;power generation protection;power generation reliability;relay protection;smart power grids","smart grid operation;hierarchically coordinated protection approach;generation patterns;power system configuration switching;distributed generation high penetration;conventional relays;reliable system operation;reliable system monitoring;reliable system control;reliable system protection;HCP approach;grid complexity;wide area measurements;fault anticipation;fault prediction;adaptive fault detection;relay operation correction;unwanted tripping;voltage levels;protection system tripping dependability;protection system tripping security","","5","","","","30 May 2013","","","IET","IET Conferences"

However the security and privacy challenges have been a concern. This is because shared data may contain some private and sensitive information of data owners or users. So it has been an important issue to balance data utilization, data privacy and users privacy. Privacy-preserving multi-authority attribute-based encryption (MA-ABE) is a promising tool to tackle this issue, but it cannot be directly applied to addressed scenario of smart power grid systems. In this paper, we propose a framework to achieve secure data sharing in smart grid. The scheme uses the technique of inner product encryption (IPE). Under this framework, the access policy and the attribute set are fuzzy by converting them into two vectors. Only when the two vectors are orthogonal, users can successfully obtain the sharing data. Besides, our scheme allows that the threshold access policy only involves attribute name indexes, and sensitive attribute values are not sent along with the shared data so the attribute privacy is preserved. In addition, in order to improve efficiency, our scheme adds a testing phase to avoid the unnecessary operation before recovering data.

Therefore, it becomes imperative to guarantee for all GNSS users the compatibility, interoperability and interchangeability between all these systems. The goal is to ensure that the user's multi-mode receiver can choose and mix signals from different GNSS and SBAS systems to achieve more availability, accuracy and robustness. Attaining that objective will require agreements on frequency plans and signal designs, as well as other details including means to ensure interoperability of system times and geodetic reference systems. This paper suggests a Universal-SBAS (U-SBAS) standard, compatible with all the existing and planned regional GNSS systems (and their evolutions) in the world, like IRNSS, QZSS, PCW, BEIDOU-1, WAAS, EGNOS, SDCM, GAGAN, MSAS. The proposed worldwide multimodal U-SBAS standard carries additional channels (signals and messages) to cover the non-aeronautical specific Safety-of-Life (SoL) services, and also High Precision Positioning Services (HPPS), Position Velocity Time (PVT), authentication services, safety services, scientific application services, High Precision Timing Services (HPTS), etc. U-SBAS is designed to be fully interoperable with the current SBAS standards and to allow significant performance and service improvements in operational, scientific and/or security areas. Finally usage examples of the proposed standard are given for different types of applications such as science, aviation, precise point positioning, timing, security, robust positioning, maritime and reflectometry.","2325-5455","978-1-4244-8741-7","10.1109/NAVITEC.2010.5708076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708076","","Global Navigation Satellite Systems;Global Positioning System;Satellites;Satellite broadcasting;Interference;Receivers","open systems;radio receivers;satellite navigation;telecommunication standards","universal multi-SBAS standard;compatibility;interoperability;interchangeability;GNSS systems;multi-mode receiver;position space based augmentation system","","1","2","92","IEEE","4 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Surveys were distributed to workers in the hospital who require access to patient records - such as clinicians and administrators. The survey resulted in an 86% response rate. The results revealed key problem areas which related to a lack of user awareness and acceptance. One of the key problems was that 79% of respondents indicated they have never had any security awareness sessions or training. Insights from the survey were used to create a framework. The framework extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance of User Technology (UTAUT) model, to address awareness and acceptance problems. The focus was on how user attitudes, beliefs and personal knowledge influence acceptance and usage of access-control technology. Recommendations made to the hospital included that mandatory awareness training programmes be conducted regularly to increase user acceptance of smart card and fingerprint-based access control.","2576-8581","978-1-905824-60-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8417340","Access control;user awareness;user acceptance;biometrics;smart cards;medical information systems;multi-modal access control","Access control;Hospitals;Smart cards;Fingerprint recognition;Medical information systems","authorisation;medical information systems;smart cards","acceptance problems;access-control technology;user acceptance;smart card;fingerprint-based access control;user awareness;medical information systems;South Africa;multimodal access control systems;security awareness sessions;Charlotte Maxeke academic hospital;Johannesburg;interpretive research design;qualitative research design;patient records;clinicians;administrators;personal knowledge influence acceptance;user attitudes;user beliefs;mandatory awareness training programmes;unified theory of acceptance of user technology model;UTAUT model","","","","24","","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems have greater advantages over traditional systems that are difficult to break and provide good anti-spoofing abilities. Use of these systems has increased in recent years owing to the increasing trend of thefts, breaking of security systems, hacking and another means of unauthorized access. In this paper a multimodal recognition algorithm using palm print and palm vein images. The palm print image is rich in line features as it consists of wrinkles, ridges and principal lines. On the other hand the palm vein image contains rich texture features in the form of blood vessel patterns also called as vein patterns. A multimodal identification system has been proposed in this paper which uses Contourlet transform to analyze the features present in palm print and palm vein images. The proposed algorithm captures local minutae and a global feature from a palm print and palm vein images and stores them as a compact code. After extraction of the ROI from the source images the (2-D) image spectrum is divided into fine sub-components (called subbands) using iterated directional filter bank structure. The feature matching technique is then performed using Euclidean Distance algorithm. For this algorithm CASIA Palm print Database V1.0 is used.","2325-9418","978-1-4799-2275-8","10.1109/INDCON.2013.6726010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726010","Biometrics;Contourlet transform;Palm print;palm vein;Euclidean distance","Veins;Feature extraction;Transforms;Gabor filters;Filter banks;Image resolution;Laplace equations","authorisation;channel bank filters;computer crime;discrete transforms;feature extraction;image matching;image texture;palmprint recognition;vein recognition;visual databases","antispoofing abilities;multimodal biometric recognition systems;multimodal recognition algorithm;palm print images;palm vein images;palm print features;palm vein features;line features;wrinkles;ridges;principal lines;texture features;blood vessel patterns;vein patterns;multimodal identification system;contourlet transform;local minutae;global feature;ROI extraction;source images;2-D image spectrum subcomponents;subbands;iterated directional filter bank structure;feature matching technique;Euclidean distance algorithm;CASIA palm print database V1.0","","8","","11","IEEE","30 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Owing to its adaptive nature in delivering a dynamic rule base, it is particularly useful for those systems which experience frequent changes. Network security is one such area where frequent changes are quite likely due to changing network conditions and traffic. Thus, D-FRI has the potential to offer an optimised and adaptive approach for improving network security. The popular Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Firewall is capable of monitoring and alerting a range of common threats, by baselining the traffic of a network and analysing the statistics of dropped packets. An ASA process yields a large volume of statistical information relating to certain security events. Yet, threat detection is a rudimentary function since additional intelligence is required to automate the extraction of meaningful information for alerting the users. This could be achieved using expensive automated tools offered by a third party, but doing so may unnecessarily expose an organisation to other security threats. This paper takes a different approach, presenting a DFRI-CiscoFirewall in support of automated threat detection for Cisco ASA Firewall. Through utilising threat detection statistics, the approach can customise the detection process according to organisational requirements. It performs the relative analysis of prioritised security events and is able to predict comprehensive security situations while no matching rules are available. In particular, the approach supports the creation of a dynamic rule base, derived from changing network conditions and traffic density. Its efficacy is demonstrated by experimental evaluations.","1558-4739","978-1-5386-1728-1","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2019.8858999","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8858999","","Firewalls (computing);Interpolation;Fuzzy logic;Monitoring;Access control;Communication networks","computer network management;firewalls;fuzzy reasoning;interpolation;knowledge based systems;security of data","dynamic fuzzy rule interpolation;Cisco ASA Firewall;sparse rule-based fuzzy reasoning;dynamic rules;dynamic rule base;network security;optimised approach;adaptive approach;security threats;automated threat detection;threat detection statistics;prioritised security events;comprehensive security situations;matching rules;D-FRI-CiscoFirewall;Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Firewall","","5","","19","Crown","11 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An initial study has concluded that the use of a hybrid ESS/wind farm under the NETA conditions would result in an increase in operating revenue. However preliminary protection investigations have highlighted concerns over appropriate control and protection under the particular scenarios of a change in operating mode from load (i.e. as an electrolyser) to a generator (i.e. to a fuel cell) and vice versa. Work is continuing to produce more detailed modelling results of such a system.

Scientist and researchers have constantly pursued the technology for automated confirmation of the identity of subjects based on measurements of physiological or behavioral traits of humans. But even the best single biometric system suffers from spoof attacks, intra-class variability, noise, susceptibility etc. To address this issue, we develop a hybrid multibiometric system which integrates multi-algorithm and multi-modal approaches of multibiometric system and use bilevel fusion to combine biometric information. We use face, ear and signature biometric traits which are first classified by three classification techniques-multilayer perceptron, Fisher-image and Bayesian network. The outcomes of these classifiers for face are fused by rank fusion method. Outcomes for ear and signature are also fused similarly. The second level fusion occurs when we combine the results of these three rank fusion methods' outcomes for face, ear and signature with decision fusion method. We use Borda count and Borda fuse approaches for rank fusion and majority voting, weighted majority voting and behavioral knowledge space approaches for decision fusion. The final results indicate that this hybrid multi biometric system outperforms the single biometric systems build on the same data using the same classification algorithms. This system can be effectively used in law enforcement or homeland security department or for commercial purposes.","","978-1-4244-2773-4","10.1109/CIB.2009.4925691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925691","","Security;Biometrics;Ear;Voting;Authentication;Access control;Electrical equipment industry;Industrial control;Humans;Bayesian methods","authorisation;belief networks;multilayer perceptrons","hybrid multibiometric system;access control;automated identity confirmation;biometric user authentication techniques;spoof attacks;intra-class variability;multi-modal approaches;biometric information;bilevel fusion;multilayer perceptron;Fisherimage;Bayesian network;rank fusion method;decision fusion method;Borda count;Borda fuse approaches;majority voting;behavioral knowledge space approaches","","3","","36","IEEE","15 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper is the result of that study. Beginning with a hypothetical problem, we develop alternative solutions for two different operating environments using network products available today.

When we can have a machine to help us track the target, we can naturally solve more problems. Not only it can be used in military applications, such as warplane radar and missiles but it can be applied in civilian purposes including home security, event broadcasting, smart home. The target tracking is becoming increasingly mature. In this paper, we aim to develop a practical three-axis target tracking system by simulating the hunting ability of snakes in nature, and we add thermal infrared images to increase the model modality and optimize the ability of existing Siamese tracking network. Multi-Modal Machine Learning (MMML) is modified with the Siamese tracking network into a multi-modal fusion model, so as to improve the model's perception. At the same time, the Siamese networks models for training normal images and thermal infrared images are separated and a pseudo-Siamese network is used as the main framework to process the different the databases. This paper successfully improves the stability and accuracy of the model. With the embedded development version and three-axis servo motor, our system can be more flexible in tracking applications.","","978-1-6654-0996-4","10.1109/AICAS54282.2022.9869937","Ministry of Science and Technology(grant numbers:110-2221-E-011-125-,110-2218-E-001-006-MBK,111-2218-E-011-011-MBK); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9869937","Target tracking;Siamese tracking network;Multi-Modal Machine Learning","Training;Missiles;Target tracking;Machine learning;Smart homes;Radar tracking;Stability analysis","image classification;infrared imaging;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor fusion;servomotors;target tracking","modern racing;military applications;warplane radar;civilian purposes;home security;event broadcasting;smart home;three-axis target tracking system;hunting ability;thermal infrared images;model modality;existing Siamese tracking network;MultiModal Machine;multimodal fusion model;Siamese networks models;normal images;pseudoSiamese network;embedded development version;tracking applications;embedded target tracking systems","","","","24","IEEE","5 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Papalexopoulos","ECCO International, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA","IEEE Power Engineering Society Summer Meeting,","26 Sep 2005","2002","3","","1168 vol.3","","Summary form only given as follows. The FERC in its RTO Order 2000 reaffirms the requirement that an RTO must (1) encourage market-motivated operating and investment actions for preventing and relieving congestion; (2) accommodate efforts by state regulatory commissions to create multi-state agreements to review and approve new transmission facilities, coordinated with programs of existing Regional Transmission Groups (RTGs) where necessary; and (3) file a plan with the FERC with specified milestones that will ensure that it meets the overall planning and expansion requirement no later than three years after initial operation, if the RTO is unable to satisfy this requirement when it commences operation. In the alternative, the RTO must demonstrate that an alternative proposal is consistent with or superior to these three requirements. The FERC expresses its preference for market-based plans, and noted that the pricing mechanisms and actions used by the RTO as part of its transmission planning and expansion program should be compatible with the pricing signals for shorter-term solutions to transmission constraints (i.e., congestion management) so that market participants can choose the least-cost response. Development and implementation of transmission projects remains a major challenge in the new competitive environment. Alternative business models including RTOs, and Transcos have been proposed as the best infrastructure under which appropriate transmission investments can be made to ensure the security of the transmission grid at least cost. This presentation discusses the various analytical approaches for evaluating prospective transmission projects. Two areas of particular difficulty are also discussed. These are: dealing with uncertainty and the interdependence of transmission and generation investment. Finally, the incorporation of market power in the wholesale electricity market into the transmission evaluation process is also discussed.","","0-7803-7518-1","10.1109/PESS.2002.1043470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1043470","","Power system planning;Pricing;Investments;Meeting planning;Proposals;Security;Costs;Uncertainty;Electricity supply industry","power transmission planning;power transmission economics;investment;costing;power markets","FERC;power system expansion planning;power system pricing;deregulated environment;RTO Order 2000;market-motivated operating actions;market-motivated investment actions;congestion prevention;congestion relief;state regulatory commissions;new transmission facilities approval;Regional Transmission Groups;market-based plans;pricing mechanisms;transmission constraints;congestion management;least-cost response;uncertainty;generation investment;transmission investment;wholesale electricity market;transmission evaluation process","","2","","","IEEE","26 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The importance of trust in a Layered Sensing construct","M. Nowak","Autonomic Trusted Sensing of Persistent Intelligence Division, Air Force Research Laboratory, Dayton, OH, USA","2010 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems","3 Jun 2010","2010","","","555","556","The technological advances of the information age have created both an opportunity and a challenge for military decision makers. At first glance, the variety of data gathered by a multitude of traditional and non-traditional Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensors should allow decision makers to better understand their environment and the threat. However, a number of factors tend to erode this advantage. Incompatible data formats, bandwidth limitations, sensor persistence and revisit rates, and multi-level security issues are but a few of the technical challenges that preclude end users from being able to take full advantage of the sensor information. Further, as the amount of sensor data increases, real challenges emerge in identifying the most salient pieces of information, fusing that with other relevant sensor modalities, and rapidly moving this information in a presentation format that does not overwhelm the decision maker. It was this problem space of improving information understanding to increase the situational awareness of decision makers that spawned the Layered Sensing vision. Layered Sensing has grown from an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate initiative into an AFRL effort that seeks to bring fused, multi-source, multi-spectral, multi-dimensional (e.g. cultural, environmental, etc.) information to decision makers consistent with their needs, regardless of their location. The end goal of Layered Sensing is to improve the situational awareness of decision makers by providing them with tailored sensor information. In essence, Layered Sensing is a Sensing Oriented Architecture where the customer can provide or request information tailored to their needs in order to facilitate situational awareness. The benefits of Layered Sensing extend beyond military application. For example, the Department of Homeland Security is one federal agency that could potentially face many of the same information challenge in operations as diverse as providing a common operating picture during a post-Katrina type reconstitution scenario or in fusing multi-source and multi-mode data (e.g. HUMINT, electronic intercepts, etc) in order to track or capture a suspected terrorist. Regardless of who implements a Layered Sensing architecture, the critical attribute of “trust” will have to be addressed - trusted information, trusted communication and trusted sensors. Trust is the sine qua non for any Layered Sensing implementation as it is difficult, if not impossible, to build situational awareness upon inaccurate, misleading, or maliciously modified information. The challenge of instilling and measuring trust in a system has many components. At the sensor node the issue of trust is one of ensuring the sensor works as intended and has not been compromised or co-opted. Between sensors, communications paths must be reliable, secure, and robust enough to recover from equipment degradation or malfunctions. Ideally, the local and global architecture should be autonomic with the ability to optimize sensor and communication performance. Finally, there needs to be a means to measure and portray the overall architecture trust picture status to those who are using it. The use of commercial off-the-shelf equipment, while cost effective, introduces its own trust issues due to uncontrollable supply chains. Relying solely on components from trusted sources is not feasible either economically or practically. As Layered Sensing moves from local architectures supporting an urban scenario to a global scenario the issue of complexity will arise. Seamlessly integrating a large number of spatially and temporally distributed heterogeneous sensors will require effective means to authenticate the new arrivals. Dynamic bandwidth allocation to account for optimal data transmission will also be important. Encompassing all of these trust issues is a way to measure and portray a “trust picture” to users. Instinctively, decision makers weigh the accuracy of data they receive based on their experiences with those data sources. For example, live-feed imagery will likely carry more weight in forming the user's situational awareness of a battle space rather than dated intelligence reports or HUMINT. For sensor derived information, the measure of trust of data is a function of the sensor, the environment it's operating in, the networks transmitting that data, and the fusion engine used to correlate the information. It's important these metrics of trust be available to the decision maker particularly if he/she is predisposed to rely on certain sensors/information sources over others. This conference represents the third time papers and studies have been presented that address the challenges associated with Layered Sensing. The purpose of this presentation is to provide a lead-in that introduces the concepts of Layered Sensing and lays the groundwork for subsequent session papers focused on the various aspects of trust.","","978-1-4244-6622-1","10.1109/CTS.2010.5478463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5478463","Layered sensing;trust;autonomic networks;situation awareness","Intelligent sensors;Terrorism;Surveillance;Reconnaissance;Bandwidth;Data security;Information security;Force sensors;Sensor fusion;Cultural differences","decision making;military computing;security of data;sensor fusion","layered sensing construct;information age;military decision makers;intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance;bandwidth limitations;sensor persistence;multilevel security;layered sensing vision;air force research laboratory;tailored sensor information;homeland security department;trusted information;trusted communication;trusted sensors;optimal data transmission;sensing oriented architecture","","","","","IEEE","3 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Managing traditional desktop environments is incredibly challenging and costly. Tasks like installations, configuration changes, security measures require time-consuming procedures and dedicated deskside support. Also these distributed desktops are typically underutilized, resulting in low ROI for these assets. Further, this distributed computing model for desktops also creates a security concern as sensitive information could be compromised with stolen laptops or PCs. Desktop virtualization, which moves computation to the data center, allows users to access their applications and data using stateless ldquothin-clientldquo devices and therefore alleviates some of the problems of traditional desktop computing. Enterprises can now leverage the flexibility and cost-benefits of running users' desktops on virtual machines hosted at the data center to enhance business agility and reduce business risks, while lowering TCO. Recent research and development of cloud computing paradigm opens new possibilities of mass hosting of desktops and providing them as a service. However, transformation of legacy systems to desktop clouds as well as proper capacity provisioning is a challenging problem. Desktop cloud needs to be appropriately designed and provisioned to offer low response time and good working experience to desktop users while optimizing back-end resource usage and therefore minimizing provider's costs.

In this article, a puncturable identity-based PRE (P-IB-PRE) scheme is proposed to efficiently protect the security and privacy of the group message. The proposed scheme introduces a message server as the proxy to transform ciphertext for each participant in the group; thus, the heavy computation overhead is delegated to the message server with abundant resources. Most importantly, our scheme enables the recipient to revoke its private key’s decryption capability of the specific messages without affecting other messages. Moreover, the identity-based mechanism eliminates the burden of certificate management as well as improves efficiency.

Such severe disturbances effect voltage phasor, current phasor and system frequency. So, to better monitor the dynamics of large power system, wide area synchronized monitoring of voltage phasor, current phasor and system frequency is vital. For efficient real time monitoring and operation of power system, high resolution based phasor measurement units (PMUs) should be used. PMU can accurately measure node and branch phasors at high sampling rate. In this paper, application of PMUs to monitor power quality and voltage instability due to contingency is shown. The paper proposes a novel approach for contingency filtering and assessment in sense of power quality and voltage instability. The approach consists of two-block technique: first block filters out dangerous contingency; then second block assesses it for severity based upon performance index. Another application is to understand system dynamics during different kinds of disturbance such as generator trip or load rejection. To realize this logic-based approach is used for analysis. This will help the operator in real time analysis of system as a whole and in deciding the nature and location of disturbance. Overall, it will help to detect emergency condition and take necessary control action in real time.

In recent years, multi-modal methods had been proven to be effective in prediction of AD and MCI by utilizing the complementary information across different modalities in AD data. In this paper, we propose self-paced sample weighting based low-rank representation (SPLRR) to explore the latent correlation across different modalities. By imposing rank minimization on different modalities regression coefficients, we can capture the intrinsic structure among modalities. Meanwhile, we introduce self-paced learning to allot the corresponding weight to samples based on the contribution of each sample to the label in the current modality.

But the recognition of face can be affected by illumination variation, facial expression and other issues. Therefore, the authentication using only face image might be difficult for the system. To overcome this challenge, biometric authentications have to rely on more than one method. In this paper, we consider audio-video person authentication based on two sources of information. Single modality evidence has limitations in both security and robustness. Therefore, here, audio recognition is added with visual recognition. Facial features, as well as speech is extracted separately from audio-visual data and integrate both the modality for secure user authentication. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is used as the speech feature. Viola-Jones and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm are used for visual feature extraction. After the extraction of audio and visual features, the feature selection method is employed.

In the past decade, False Data Injection (FDI) attacks have attracted extensive attention, as they provide a strategy to introduce bias to SE results by maliciously modifying measurements in a way that can bypass BDD. Regrettably, although FDI attacks are plausible in math, whether they are feasible in practice has not been paid enough attention. This paper tries to give an answer by formulating three FDI attack vectors, each exploiting the vulnerability of a different communication protocol to achieve background reconnaissance and data tampering. Based on the proposed attack vectors, the path of launching FDI attacks in a concrete cyber environment and the corresponding defense countermeasures are analyzed through cyber-physical co-simulation. Case studies demonstrate that applying classical countermeasures, such as cryptographic techniques and access control policies, can effectively frustrate FDI attacks in the real world. Futhermore, it can be summarized from the experiments that attackers may leverage side-effects of defense countermeasures to mount more subtle attacks. It is essential to consider defending against cyber-physical attacks from an overall perspective in the future.","","979-8-3503-2117-3","10.1109/PandaFPE57779.2023.10140382","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10140382","attack vector;cyber-physical power system;false data injection attack;cyber-physical co-simulation;state estimation","Access control;Protocols;Reconnaissance;Data models;Power systems;Cryptography;State estimation","access protocols;authorisation;computer network security;cryptography;cyber-physical systems;state estimation","access control policies;accurate operating states;background reconnaissance;Bad Data Detection;BDD;classical countermeasure perspective;communication protocol;concrete cyber environment;cryptographic techniques;cyber-physical attacks;cyber-physical co-simulation;data tampering;defense countermeasures;False Data Injection attacks;FDI attack vectors;measurement outliers;redundant field measurements;SE results;simulation implementation;State Estimation","","","","17","IEEE","9 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider the observer with messages and the input with keys to be the transmitting agents. The optimal linearization technique is utilized to obtain the exact linear models of a chaotic system for operating states of interest. An EKF algorithm is used to estimate the parameters and states in which the message is already embedded.

Real-time successful identification of false data injection attacks is an indispensable requirement to ensure secure and reliable grid operation. State forecasting driven detection models can effectively determine the deviations of the operating states due to FDIA.

Such methodology may no longer be sufficient and appropriate for investigating the performance of state-of-the-art systems. This paper addresses this gap by establishing taxonomy of biometric systems and proposing a baseline methodology that can be applied to the majority of contemporary biometric systems to obtain an all-inclusive description of their performance. In doing that, a novel concept of multi-order performance analysis is introduced and the results obtained from a large-scale iris biometric system examination are presented.","2329-6275","978-1-4244-3763-4","10.1109/CISDA.2009.5356531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356531","","Biometrics;Image recognition;Taxonomy;Performance analysis;Software measurement;System testing;Computational intelligence;Security;Large-scale systems;Iris","iris recognition","person recognition system;contemporary biometric system evaluation;taxonomy;multi-order performance analysis;large-scale iris biometric system examination","","17","","8","IEEE","18 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the abundance of data could improve system efficiency, it poses major reliability challenges. In particular, state estimation aims to find the operating state of a network from the telemetered data, but an undetected attack on the data could lead to making wrong operational decisions for the system and trigger a large-scale blackout. Nevertheless, understanding the vulnerability of state estimation with regards to cyberattacks, which is a special instance of graph-structured quadratic sensing problem, has been hindered by the lack of tools for studying the topological and data-analytic aspects of networks. Algorithmic robustness is critical in extracting reliable information from abundant but untrusted grid data. For a large-scale power grid, we quantify, analyze, and visualize the regions of the network that are not robust to cyberattacks in the sense that there exists a data manipulation strategy for each of those local regions that misleads the operator at the global scale and yields a wrong estimation of the state of the network at almost all buses. We also propose an optimization-based graphical boundary defense mechanism to identify the border of the geographical area in which data have been manipulated. The proposed method does not allow a local attack to have a global effect on the data analysis of the entire network, which enhances the situational awareness of the grid, especially in the face of adversity. The developed mathematical framework reveals key geometric and algebraic factors that can affect algorithmic robustness and is used to study the vulnerability of the U.S. power grid in this paper.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2020.3043065","ONR(grant numbers:N00014-17-1-2933); NSF(grant numbers:1807260); ARO(grant numbers:W911NF-17-1-0555); AFOSR(grant numbers:FA9550-17-1-0163); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9290080","Power system state estimation;CPS security;robust algorithm;smart grid","Power grids;Robustness;Sensors;Power system reliability;State estimation;Computer crime;Optimization","graph theory;optimisation;power grids;power system reliability;power system state estimation","mathematical framework;U.S. power grid;untrusted grid data;telemetered data analysis;large-scale blackout;reliability;data-centric;power system state estimation;cyber threat;optimization-based graphical boundary defense mechanism;data manipulation strategy;large-scale power grid;graph-structured quadratic sensing problem;cyberattacks","","9","","46","IEEE","10 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A typical application is to combine both audio and face for multimodal person recognition, since either face or voice is among the most natural biometrics that people use to identify each other. In this paper, a novel approach called multi-feature subspace analysis (MFSA) is proposed for audio-video based biometric person recognition. In the MFSA framework, each face sequence or utterance is represented with a fix-length feature vector, and then subspace analysis method is performed on a collection of random subspaces to construct an ensemble of classifiers for robust recognition.

However, in robot applications, the conditions are far severer compared to the traditional biometric security systems. The robots should be able to recognize users non-intrusively, which confines the available biometric features to face and voice. Also, the robots are expected to recognize users from relatively afar, which inevitably deteriorates the accuracy of each recognition module. In this paper, we tried to improve the overall accuracy by integrating the evidences issued by independently developed face and speaker recognition modules. Each recognition module exhibits different statistical characteristics in representing its confidence of the recognition. Therefore, it is essential to transform the evidences to a normalized form to integrate the results. This paper introduces a novel approach to integrate mutually independent multiple evidences to achieve an improved performance. Typical approach to this problem is to model the statistical characteristics of the evidences by well-known parametric form such as Gaussian. Using Mahalanobis distance is a good example. However, the characteristics of the evidences often do not fit into the parametric models, which results in performance degradation. To overcome this problem, we adopted a discrete PDF that can model the statistical characteristics as it is. To confirm the validity of the proposed method, we used a multi-modal database that consists of 10 registered users and 550 probe data. Each probe data contains face image and voice signal. Face and speaker recognition modules are applied to generate respective evidences. The experiment showed an improvement of 11.27% in accuracy compared to the individual recognizers, which is 2.72% better than the traditional Mahalanobis distance approach.","1944-9437","978-1-4244-1634-9","10.1109/ROMAN.2007.4415170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4415170","","Speaker recognition;Probability density function;Biometrics;Character recognition;Probes;Intelligent robots;Service robots;Security;Face recognition;Speech recognition","biometrics (access control);face recognition;Gaussian processes;intelligent robots;probability;robot vision;service robots;speaker recognition","face recognition systems;speaker recognition systems;discrete probability density function;user recognition;intelligent service robots;biometric security systems;Gaussian parametric;Mahalanobis distance;statistical characteristics","","1","","10","IEEE","16 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A combined objective function appropriate for various system load levels with suitable constraints for the treatment of power system security and economy is also proposed. For the real-time voltage/receiver power control, a suboptimal power flow procedure has been derived by using the reduced set of control variables. This procedure is based on sensitivity theory applied to the determination of zones for the secondary voltage/reactive power control and a corresponding reduced set of regulating sources, whose reactive outputs represent control variables in the optimal power flow program.

The COVID-19 is virulent and spreads widely. An outbreak in one region often triggers the spread of others, and regions with relatively close association would show a strong correlation in the spread of the epidemic. In the real world, many factors affect the spread of the outbreak between regions. These factors exist in the form of multimodal data, such as the time-series data of the epidemic, the geographic relationship, and the strength of social contacts between regions. However, most of the current work only uses historical epidemic data or single-modal geographic location data to forecast the spread of the epidemic, ignoring the correlation and complementarity in multi-modal data and its impact on the disease spread between regions. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal InformatioN fusion COVID-19 Epidemic forecasting model (MINE). It fuses inter-regional and intra-regional multi-modal information to capture the temporal and spatial relevance of the COVID-19 spread in different regions. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the best results compared to state-of-art methods on benchmark datasets.","","978-1-6654-0126-5","10.1109/BIBM52615.2021.9669328","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Shandong University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9669328","multi-modal information fusion;COVID-19 forecasting;graph neural network;self-attention;social network analysis","COVID-19;Epidemics;Correlation;Fuses;Biological system modeling;Network analyzers;Predictive models","Bayes methods;diseases;sensor fusion;statistical analysis;time series","multimodal information fusion-powered regional Covid-19;current raging spread;COVID19;future epidemic trend;public health security;outbreak;multimodal data;time-series data;disease spread;Multimodal InformatioN fusion COVID-19 Epidemic forecasting model;intra-regional multimodal information;COVID-19 spread","","","","20","IEEE","14 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, the setup modification is unnecessary by a customer, which shows a merit for both a system administrator and a customer. However, there is a problem to be solved. In existing DACS scheme, it is promised that, DACS client for controlling the communication must be implemented on all clients.

The increase in bots breaking CAPTCHAs shows the ineffectiveness of the text-based CAPTCHAs that are used on most websites and Webmail services today. Bots can easily read the distorted letters and words using optical character recognition (OCR) or break the CAPTCHA using a dictionary attack.

The optimization problem is formulated to schedule the system operation in both normal and islanding modes by addressing the prevailing uncertainties of islanding duration as well as prediction errors of loads, renewable power generation, and electricity price. In a normal operation mode, where the grid-connection is available, the energy and reserve of local resources and energy trading with the main grid is scheduled to maximize the operator's profit considering feasible islanding. In a resilient operating mode, which is triggered by a disturbance in the main grid, the local resources should be scheduled to supply loads with the lowest emergency load shedding. To balance the economy and security requirements under uncertainties, the optimal scheduling is done properly through a security-constrained power flow method by considering system's objectives and constraints. Moreover, to properly handle the uncertainties of the problem, conditional value-at-risk metric is incorporated with the optimization model to control the risk of profit variability. The proposed scheme is implemented on a test microgrid and various case studies are presented to verify its effectiveness in normal and resiliency operating conditions.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2020.3026142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9229142","Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR);demand response;optimal scheduling;resilient microgrid;stochastic framework","Microgrids;Uncertainty;Optimal scheduling;Stochastic processes;Islanding;Load modeling;Indexes","demand side management;distributed power generation;load flow;load shedding;optimisation;power distribution economics;power distribution faults;power generation economics;power generation scheduling;power grids;power markets;power system security;pricing;stochastic processes","islanding modes;renewable power generation;electricity price;operation mode;grid-connection;local resources;energy trading;resilient operating mode;optimal scheduling;security-constrained power flow method;conditional value-at-risk metric;optimization model;risk-based stochastic scheduling;resilient microgrids;demand response programs;risk-constrained stochastic framework;load shedding;resiliency operating conditions","","27","","31","IEEE","19 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, information integration from different imaging modalities, such as thermal infrared and visible spectrum, can significantly improve the detection rate in respect to mono-modal strategies. For this reason, an effective fusion scheme is necessary to combine the information presented by multiple sensors. In this paper, we propose a pedestrian classification method based on the multiple kernel learning framework; standard pixel features (such as spatial derivatives) from both imaging modalities are employed to learn several feature-related basic kernels and a compound kernel is found as an optimized linear combination of basic kernels. Finally the compound kernel is used to train an SVM. Experiments performed on the OTCBVS dataset [1], demonstrate that our recipe definitely outclasses a wide set of literature fusion modalities.","1051-4651","978-4-9906441-0-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6460652","","Kernel;Feature extraction;Vectors;Training;Imaging;Support vector machines;Standards","image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);pedestrians;support vector machines;traffic engineering computing","multiple kernel learning approach;multimodal pedestrian classification;computer vision applications;surveillance systems;security systems;information integration;thermal infrared spectrum;visible spectrum;detection rate improvement;monomodal strategies;multiple sensors;standard pixel features;spatial derivatives;imaging modalities;feature-related basic kernels;compound kernel;linear combination optimization;SVM;OTCBVS dataset;literature fusion modalities;pedestrian detection","","","","13","","14 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A multi-robot system performing exploration can be highly beneficial for this purpose by distributing the work amongst the different robots. In this paper, we present a distributed approach to multi-robot exploration which always keeps all the robots in communication range. The algorithm is based on a utility function that guarantees communication while using best effort for the exploration itself. The robots randomly sample configuration changes of the overall system, i.e., the set of the next best joined movements based on this utility function. This process can be very well distributed with very few communication overhead by having each robot computing a part of the sample and broadcasting its best candidate configuration change found. The globally best candidate among the broadcasted ones is then executed by the team. The algorithm is tested in a high-fidelity marine robotics simulator including realistic vehicle physics and proper underlying software for mapping, path-planning, and motion-control.","2374-3247","978-1-61284-769-6","10.1109/SSRR.2011.6106767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6106767","Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV);Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV);exploration;multi robot coordination;utility based control;underwater communication","Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Heuristic algorithms;System recovery;Underwater vehicles;Bandwidth","mobile robots;motion control;multi-robot systems;path planning;remotely operated vehicles;underwater vehicles","distributed communicative exploration;underwater communication constraint;unmanned underwater vehicle;safety security and rescue robotics;military reconnaissance;marine search and rescue;mine hunting;multi-robot exploration;utility function;high-fidelity marine robotics;mapping;path planning;motion control","","8","","30","IEEE","19 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article summarizes power grids as temporal weighted networks (TWNs) which are different from conventional temporal networks. For TWN, the topological structure is fixed but weight distribution is time varying. Then it is noted that for different operating states represented by different weight (power flow) distribution at different time sections, the risks of cascading failures would be completely different. Inspired by the analysis of intersubnetworks power shifts in cascading failures, inverse-community (IC) structure is proposed in TWN to intuitively identify the risk of cascading failures. IC describes a structure in weighted networks with several communities in which the weighted interaction between communities is significantly stronger than that within the same community. Furthermore, the conventional modularity is upgraded as inverse-modularity (IM) to quantify the characteristic of IC structure in power networks. Subsequently, considering the risk of cascading failures represented by IM and the cost of power network operation, a security/economic dispatch (SED) method is designed to handle the optimal power dispatch issues. Simulation results prove a positive correlation between IM of power flow distribution and risk of cascading failures. Furthermore, the results on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SED method in mitigating cascading failure risks.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3189001","Research Development Fund of Xi’an Jiaotong–Liverpool University(grant numbers:RDF-15-02-14,RDF-18-01-04); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51877181); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9817092","Cascading failure;complex network;Internet of Things (IoT);inverse-community (IC) structure;security/economic dispatch (SED);temporal weighted network","Power system protection;Power system faults;Power grids;Load flow;Internet of Things;Load modeling;Integrated circuit modeling","Internet of Things;load flow;power engineering computing;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power grids;power system security","cascading failures;Internet of Things;inverse-community structure;optimal power dispatch issues;power flow distribution;power grids;power network operation;security-economic dispatch method;SED method;temporal weighted networks","","","","43","IEEE","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a dynamic feature, lip reading feature is not easy to imitate, and can be collected with face information at the same time, so it has high convenience. Fusion of lip reading and face information can improve the accuracy of the authentication system, at the same time, greatly enhance the anti-counterfeiting ability of the recognition system.

Modern grid operators must detect the presence of such attacks in the raw field measurements to guarantee a safe and reliable operation of the grid. State forecasting based FDIA identification schemes have recently shown its efficacy by determining the deviation of the estimated states due to an attack. This work emphasizes on a scalable deep learning state forecasting model which can accurately determine the presence of FDIA in real-time.

The visual differences presented to the face have a significant effect on the recognition capabilities of the kinship systems. We argue that aggregating multiple visual knowledge can better describe the characteristics of the subject for precise kinship identification. Typically, the age-invariant features can represent more natural facial details. Such age-related transformations are essential for face recognition due to the biological effects of aging. However, the existing methods mainly focus on employing the single-view image features for kinship identification, while more meaningful visual properties such as race and age are directly ignored in the feature learning step. To this end, we propose a novel deep collaborative multi-modal learning (DCML) to integrate the underlying information presented in facial properties in an adaptive manner to strengthen the facial details for effective unsupervised kinship verification. Specifically, we construct a well-designed adaptive feature fusion mechanism, which can jointly leverage the complementary properties from different visual perspectives to produce composite features and draw greater attention to the most informative components of spatial feature maps. Particularly, an adaptive weighting strategy is developed based on a novel attention mechanism, which can enhance the dependencies between different properties by decreasing the information redundancy in channels in a self-adaptive manner. Moreover, we propose to use self-supervised learning to further explore the intrinsic semantics embedded in raw data and enrich the diversity of samples. As such, we could further improve the representation capabilities of kinship feature learning and mitigate the multiple variations from original visual images. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experimental evaluations conducted on four widely-used datasets show that our DCML method is always superior to some state-of-the-art kinship verification methods.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3098165","University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2018-00035-FST,MYRG2019-00086-FST); Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR(grant numbers:0034/2019/AMJ,0087/2020/A2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9490195","Kinship verification;information security;self-supervised learning","Feature extraction;Task analysis;Visualization;Supervised learning;Correlation;Collaboration;Semantics","computer vision;deep learning (artificial intelligence);face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;image fusion;security of data;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","information security;DCML;biological effects;unsupervised kinship verification;original visual images;self-supervised learning;self-adaptive manner;adaptive weighting strategy;spatial feature maps;composite features;visual perspectives;adaptive feature fusion mechanism;facial properties;meaningful visual properties;single-view image features;face recognition;age-related transformations;age-invariant features;multiple visual knowledge;recognition capabilities;computer vision;unsupervised kinship estimation;deep collaborative multimodal learning","","","","59","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has prompted most governments and business organizations to change the way they do business and manage the user's identity information. However Internet users are vulnerable to identity fraud, which is on the increase and costing the global economy excessive amounts. With the advent of wireless technologies, peer-to-peer communication, GSM networks, it is becoming more challenging to build systems to authenticate users more efficiently. Traditional methods of authenticating a user with passwords and PIN numbers only are slowly proving ineffective since these credentials are easy to guess and steal. This paper proposes a distributed multimodal authentication system as a solution for managing digital identity information on most wireless networks. The proposed system uses artificial intelligence methods and biometrics to improve the security and privacy of users and service providers in a transparent, reliable and efficient way.

Understanding the impact of design decisions on the system quality is crucial for successful system development. It is difficult to estimate the requirements for safety (at an early development stage) considering the innovation aspect of automated driving. These safety requirements have a considerable influence on project planning and development cost. Therefore, it is important for the industry to understand the decision points and their impact on system design. In this article, we share our experience on understanding the impact of early design decisions on safety requirements. We particularly discuss the impact of design decisions regarding the operational design domain on (functional) safety. We provide two automated driving systems as discussion cases and investigate the impact of the operational situation on the safety requirements such as safe state and degraded operating mode.

Risk-aware, real-time security constrained economic dispatch (RT-SCED) provides an efficient solution towards promptly, economically and robustly responding to the changes in the power system operating state. Despite different model-based methods have been developed to handle uncertainties, significant computation burden arise to incorporate $N$-1 contingency constraints with a higher temporal resolution in RT-SCED. Driven by similar computational challenges, risk evaluation is often overlooked in the current application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based data-driven methods in RT-SCED. This paper proposes a DRL-based risk-aware RT-SCED methodological framework by incorporating a novel data-driven risk evaluation model to foster efficient agent-environment interactions. The real-time dispatch policies are constructed with an improved twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient method. The policy network features a residual network architecture and incorporates an active power allocation mechanism to integrate empirical dispatch knowledge, preventing early termination and fostering more efficient learning behavior.

Thus, the aim of this paper is to comparatively evaluate the robustness of multi-modal systems, in serial and parallel fusion modes, under spoofing attacks. In particular, we empirically investigate the vulnerability of serial and parallel fusion of face and fingerprint biometrics to real spoofing attacks. Our results show that multi-modal systems in both fusion modes are vulnerable to attacks against a single bio-metric trait.

Many counterfeits can be identified once installed, however even a tech-savvy user may struggle to detect them before installation as app icons and descriptions can be quite similar to the original app. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage the recent advances in deep learning methods to create image and text embeddings so that counterfeit apps can be efficiently identified when they are submitted to be published in app markets. We show that for the problem of counterfeit detection, a novel approach of combining content embeddings and style embeddings (given by the Gram matrix of CNN feature maps) outperforms the baseline methods for image similarity such as SIFT, SURF, LATCH, and various image hashing methods. We first evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two well-known datasets for evaluating image similarity methods and show that, content, style, and combined embeddings increase precision@k and recall@k by 10-15 percent and 12-25 percent, respectively when retrieving five nearest neighbours. Second specifically for the app counterfeit detection problem, combined content and style embeddings achieve 12 and 14 percent increase in precision@k and recall@k, respectively compared to the baseline methods. We also show that adding text embeddings further increases the performance by 5 and 6 percent in terms of precision@k and recall@k, respectively when $k$k is five. Third, we present an analysis of approximately 1.2 million apps from Google Play Store and identify a set of potential counterfeits for top-10,000 popular apps. Under a conservative assumption, we were able to find 2,040 potential counterfeits that contain malware in a set of 49,608 apps that showed high similarity to one of the top-10,000 popular apps in Google Play Store.

In this paper, we propose to complement these learned models with the specification approaches. To build a robust model, we need to consider configuration-level specifications in addition to protocol specification. As Modbus/TCP is a simple protocol with handful function code(s) or commands for each communication channel, designing a specification-based approach is suitable for monitoring this communication. We do a comparison of DFA and DTMC approaches in two datasets and illustrate how to use our inferred specification to complement these models.","","978-1-5090-3065-1","10.1109/CNS.2016.7860524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860524","","Protocols;Data models;Conferences;Intrusion detection;Communication channels;Buildings","computer network security;deterministic automata;Markov processes;SCADA systems;telecommunication channels;transport protocols","Modbus TCP modeling;intrusion detection;deterministic finite automata;DFA;DTMC;discrete time Markov chain;SCADA;supervisory control and data acquisition system;configuration-level specification;specification-based approach","","8","","10","IEEE","23 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Magnetic field sensors are important for building automated functions in production lines, intelligent transportation systems, security systems and so on. The orthogonal fluxgate mechanism provides miniaturized low-cost magnetic sensors which can be incorporated in a compact electronic systems.

When the magnetic anisotropy is present, however, in an amorphous wire at off circumferential direction, the offset may arise and the input-output response curve becomes asymmetric with respect to the origin.

Because of the rise of battery or even field-supplied systems these mechanisms often heavily decrease available power budgets or lead to significantly increased production costs. Therefore, this paper introduces novel micro-architectural execution signature characterization and handling techniques for system-on-chip designs providing power estimation hardware.

Biometric security becomes a positive solution, adopted for many identification problems in various sectors, including Aviation. As the avionics business keeps growing worldwide, air terminals face the difficulties of increasingly more passenger volumes; with that, travelers' desire for a secure and consistent pass through the airport terminals is just expanding. COVID-19 has managed a hit in all parts of our lives. Maintaining social distance and wearing masks are very important in maintaining a person's health in this pandemic situation. In this scenario, facial recognition for passenger identification is difficult and tends to false acceptance of passengers with identical faces. To address this issue, contactless biometric traits like iris and fingerprints are considered for security growth. The paper deals with the fusion of iris and fingerprint to identify passengers without removing the masks and promotes safe travel. The iris and fingerprint features are extracted using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM) and cross number technique. Maintaining these templates requires more space for storage. To make this simple, Sparse autoencoder, an unsupervised deep learning technique is incorporated on the fused template for attaining the dimensionality reduction. A minimum cost matcher(MCM) is employed to increase the multimodal biometric system's accuracy and performance. Thus, the proposed system honors passenger security builds confidence in air travel, and also strives for economic growth.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438214","","Dimensionality reduction;Deep learning;COVID-19;Pandemics;Face recognition;Fingerprint recognition;Retina","airports;avionics;biometrics (access control);deep learning (artificial intelligence);face recognition;feature extraction;fingerprint identification;image fusion;iris recognition;unsupervised learning","unsupervised deep learning;fused template;dimensionality reduction;multimodal biometric system;passenger security;air travel;sparse autoencoder;number technique;fingerprint features;safe travel;security growth;iris;contactless biometric traits;identical faces;passenger identification;facial recognition;pandemic situation;wearing masks;social distance;COVID-19;airport terminals;secure pass;travelers;passenger volumes;air terminals;avionics business;aviation;identification problems;biometric security;multimodal biometrics;dimensional reduction","","1","","34","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we use SDN paradigm combined with machine learning to leverage the benefits of programmable flow-based telemetry with flexible data-driven models to manage IoT devices based on their network activity. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We analyze traffic traces of 17 real consumer IoT devices collected in our lab over a six-month period and identify a set of traffic flows (per-device) whose time-series attributes computed at multiple timescales (from a minute to an hour) characterize the network behavior of various IoT device types, and their operating states (i.e., booting, actively interacted with user, or being idle); (2) We develop a multi-stage architecture of inference models that use flow-level attributes to automatically distinguish IoT devices from non-IoTs, classify individual types of IoT devices, and identify their states during normal operations. We train our models and validate their efficacy using real traffic traces; and (3) We quantify the trade-off between performance and cost of our solution, and demonstrate how our monitoring scheme can be used in operation for detecting behavioral changes (firmware upgrade or cyber attacks).","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2020.2971213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8981946","IoT;device monitoring;flow characteristics;machine learning","Monitoring;Telemetry;Performance evaluation;Object recognition;Machine learning;Cameras;Internet of Things","computer network security;firmware;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic;telemetry","nonIoTs;real traffic traces;IoT cyber-security;cyber-security risks;Internet of Things devices;network operators;network monitoring technologies;network switches;programmable flow-based telemetry;flexible data-driven models;network activity;traffic flows;network behavior;real consumer IoT devices;flow-level attributes;SDN paradigm;machine learning;time-series attributes;firmware upgrade;cyber attacks","","38","","57","IEEE","4 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although those results were obtained under a worst-case scenario when the attacker is able to replicate the exact appearance of the true biometric, this raises the issue of investigating more thoroughly the robustness of multi-modal systems against spoof attacks and devising new methods to design robust systems against them. To this aim, in this paper we propose a robustness evaluation method which takes into account also scenarios more realistic than the worst-case one. Our method is based on an analytical model of the score distribution of fake traits, which is assumed to lie between the one of genuine and impostor scores, and is parametrised by a measure of the relative distance to the distribution of impostor scores, we name “fake strength”. Varying the value of such parameter allows one to simulate the different factors which can affect the distribution of fake scores, like the ability of the attacker to replicate a certain biometric. Preliminary experimental results on real bi-modal biometric data sets made up of faces and fingerprints show that the widely used LLR rule can be highly vulnerable to spoof attacks against one only matcher, even when the attack has a low fake strength.","2153-0742","978-1-4577-0903-6","10.1109/CCST.2011.6095935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095935","","Robustness;Biometrics;Biological system modeling;Testing;System performance;Data models;Training data","biometrics (access control);security of data","robustness analysis;likelihood ratio score fusion rule;multimodal biometric system;spoof attack;spoofed biometric replica;robust system design;robustness evaluation method;fake trait score distribution;genuine score;impostor score;fake strength","","15","","16","IEEE","8 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through experiments using a Raspberry Pi platform, we demonstrate the capability of our target detection system to provide efficient operational tradeoffs among detection accuracy, energy efficiency, and processing speed.","2076-1465","978-0-9928626-7-1","10.23919/EUSIPCO.2017.8081355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8081355","","Sensors;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Acoustics;Signal processing algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Signal processing","data flow analysis;embedded systems;object detection;sensor fusion","optimized embedded target detection system;acoustic sensors;seismic sensors;low power embedded devices;border security;sensor fusion;border surveillance;multimode embedded signal processing system;long term energy-efficient standby operation;single-modality signal processing;dual-modality signal processing;dataflow-based design optimization;Raspberry Pi platform","","4","","14","","26 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A Cancelable Multi-Modal Biometric Based Encryption Scheme for Medical Images","A. N. Carey; J.

It is based upon the ever-secure Advanced Encryption Standard Cipher Block Chaining (AES-CBC) mode of encryption and Indexing-First One (IFO) hashing for the generation of the secret keys. The proposed system utilizes two biometrics of the user, the iris and the fingerprint, but instead of using the features of the biometrics directly, they are hashed through the IFO process to create a secret key that can be revoked and regenerated in case of a compromise ensuring the security of the users biometrics. The IFO hashes obtained from the biometric feature vectors are then used as two different secret keys in a two round AES-CBC system to encrypt the medical image. The medical image can be decrypted by performing the AES-CBC rounds in reverse with the correct keys, meaning that with high probability, only the correct user will be able to decrypt the image. This encryption technique improves upon many existing medical encryption schemes based on biometrics, which do not take the protection of the biometric template into account. We were able to perform one full key generation, encryption and decryption in.027 seconds. In addition, this processes is lossless, meaning that there is no change in the pixels of the medical image during the encryption or decryption process, which is necessary of a medical image encryption system.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9377901","Arkansas Research Alliance; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377901","Encryption;Medical Images;Biometrics;Template Protection;Image security;AES-CBC","Image coding;Biometrics (access control);Big Data;Encryption;Standards;Biomedical imaging;Iris recognition","biometrics (access control);fingerprint identification;indexing;iris recognition;medical image processing;private key cryptography;vectors","IFO hashing;biometric feature vectors;secret keys;AES-CBC system;decryption process;medical image encryption system;cancelable multimodal biometric;medical encryption schemes;encryption process;advanced encryption standard cipher block chaining system;indexing first one hashing;fingerprint biometric;iris biometric","","2","","34","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To support collaborative awareness, cloud-assisted CAV are being developed besides Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communications. CAVs require efficient and accurate information from numerous sources, internal and external to the vehicle, for time-critical safety applications. As such, cloud-assisted CAVs would be exposed to a large amount of dynamic information (such as speed, location, vehicle ID, travel routes, passengers' personal information, bank details and so on). Moreover, CAVs have a reasonably long lifetime due to which the associated vehicular technologies in CAVs age and it is possible that vulnerabilities can be exploited to inflict harm. As a result, when technologies change, the security requirements evolve. This research aims to discuss significant research challenges, classify emerging threats, attacks and countermeasures and identify immediate research directions to protect the evolving cloud-assisted CAVs with security mechanisms to adapt to complex and dynamic environments.","","978-1-83953-089-0","10.1049/cp.2019.0142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9038006","CONNECTED AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES;CLOUD;ATTACK TAXONOMY;ADAPTIVE SECURITY","","","","","","","","","19 Mar 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This paper proposes a short-term reliability assessment approach for IPGS with alternative gas injections. First, the multi-performance and multi-state universal generating functions (UGF) are constructed to efficiently model the short-term reliability of the power-to-gas facility and the wind farm, respectively. Then, a reliability management UGF operator is proposed to minimize both load shedding and gas security violation. A set of novel reliability indices is proposed to comprehensively assess the gas security violations under uncertain gas compositions. Moreover, an analytical short-term reliability assessment approach is proposed, where the state-based sequential approximation and state-based McCormick envelope techniques are tailored and embedded. By optimizing the solution order by the system states, the nonconvexities in the reliability management optimization problem can be handled tractably without increasing the computation burden.

State estimation algorithms (SEAs) play a pivotal role in this domain by accurately furnishing the operating states of the grid. Lately a new genre of cyber attacks compromising the data integrity of the grid namely the false data injection attack (FDIA) has illustrated its detrimental consequences by efficiently evading the traditional bad data detection algorithm. Grid operators must ensure an efficient identification of such class of attacks residing in the measurement set, hence confirming a safe and reliable operation of the power sector. Identification of FDIA subsuming state forecasting policies can accurately capture the variations introduced in the set of estimated states due to an attack. This work advocates the implementation of a scalable neural network structure which showcases an effective forecasting policy of operational states, hence showcasing its potential to detect the presence of an attack in real-time. The recommended neural network structure with its optimum hyper-parameters promote a superior state forecasting stratagem with the least error in comparison to most of the modern state forecasting approaches.

Throughout your career, you will likely have to oversee and participate in incident response activities, which will include conducting investigations, handling material that may be used as evidence in criminal prosecution and/or civil suits, and performing forensic analysis. The Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) should also be familiar with common tools for mitigating, detecting, and responding to threats and attacks; this includes knowledge of the importance and use of event logging as a means to enhance security efforts. Another facet the security practitioner may have to manage could be how the organization deals with emergencies, including disaster recovery. There is a common thread running through all aspects of this topic: supporting business functions by incorporating security policy and practices with normal daily activities. This involves maintaining an accurate and detailed asset inventory, tracking the security posture and readiness of information technology (IT) assets through the use of configuration/change management, and ensuring personnel are trained and given adequate support for their own safety and security.","","9781119601968","10.1002/9781119601951.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821765.pdf&bkn=9820841&pdfType=chapter","","Ethics;Codes;Security;Law;Organizations;Safety;Standards","","","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Intrusion detection performance depends on accuracy, which needs to improve to decrease false alarms and to increase the detection rate. To resolve concerns on performance, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM), and other techniques have been used in recent work. Such techniques indicate limitations and are not efficient for use in large data sets, such as system and network data. The intrusion detection system is used in analyzing huge traffic data; thus, an efficient classification technique is necessary to overcome the issue. This problem is considered in this paper. Well-known machine learning techniques, namely, SVM, random forest, and extreme learning machine (ELM) are applied. These techniques are well-known because of their capability in classification.

The increase of Internet-connected devices has caused attackers to focus their attention more on these devices. Therefore, new and more sophisticated attacks on IoT systems are discovered every day. Currently, to ensure reliability and operability, most IoT systems are designed to operate in a relatively static configuration in a highly heterogeneous environment. However, a system that does not continuously change its configurations, i.e., a static system, gives an advantage to attackers; with enough time and resources, an attacker will eventually find and exploit the vulnerabilities of any static target. This work proposes a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy that randomly shuffles the communication protocols through which a node communicates to a gateway in an IoT network. The system’s configuration changes have an associated cost. The objective of the proposed MTD strategy in this work is to balance the increase in system performance overhead, the increase in business impact (system unavailability), and, at the same time, the decrease in the probability of success of a given attack. A framework is proposed to design this strategy; this framework can guide any MTD strategy for IoT systems. The framework’s objective is to find, after several iterations, the MTD strategy parameters that achieve a balance between five different measurable variables of an IoT system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3107403","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (CONACYT); Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN)(grant numbers:SIP-1999,SIP-20210039); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521488","Moving target defense;Internet of Things;cybersecurity;framework","Protocols;IP networks;Computer security;System performance;Internet of Things;Resilience;Performance evaluation","computer network security;Internet of Things;probability;protocols","moving target defense strategy;IoT network;IoT system;MTD strategy parameters;Internet of Things;Internet-connected devices","","4","","19","CCBY","24 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Physiological signals gathered from smartbands may be used to create a multi-modal and multi-sensor authentication system. The popularity of smartbands enables us to deploy new applications without a need to buy additional hardware. In this study, we explore the multi-modal physiological biometrics with end-to-end deep learning and feature-based traditional systems. We collected multi-modal physiological data of 80 people for five days using modern smartbands. We applied a deep learning approach to the multi-modal physiological data and used feature-based traditional machine learning classifiers.

With a total of 154 remote substations communicating through the SCADA system with a Control Room and over 98 days of observation, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the most extensive dataset of this kind analyzed to date.By combining the information obtained from engineering and IEC 104 network traffic, we reconstruct the gas distribution system’s layout, including the type and purpose of the substations and the physical properties of the gas that enters the SCADA system. Our analysis shows that it is possible to extract this information, essential for security monitoring, purely from the raw network traffic and without background knowledge provided by the control system engineers.

Increasingly, critical decisions are being made using these AI systems in application domains such as employment, finance, and crime prevention. These applications are done through the use of more abstract concepts such as emotions, trait evaluations (e.g., trustworthiness), and behavior (e.g., deception). These abstract concepts are learned by the AI system using the verbal and non-verbal cues from the human subject stimuli (e,g., facial expressions, movements, audio, text) for inference. Because the use of AI systems often happens in high stakes scenarios, it is of utmost importance that the AI system participating in the decision-making process is highly reliable and credible. In this paper, we specifically consider the feasibility of using such an AI system for deception detection. We examine if deception can be caught using multimodal aspects such as facial expressions and movements, audio cues, video cues, etc. We experiment using three different datasets with varying degrees of deception to explore the problem of deception detection. We also study state-of-the-art deception detection systems and investigate whether we can extend their algorithm into new datasets. We conclude that there is a lack of reasonable evidence that AI-based deception detection is generalizable over different scenarios of lying (lying deliberately, lying under duress, and lying through half-truths) and that in the future additional factors will need to be considered to make such a claim.","","978-1-7281-8543-9","10.1109/TPS-ISA50397.2020.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9325368","deception detection;multi-modal data analysis;machine learning;ethics;facial expressions","Feature extraction;Artificial intelligence;Reliability;Measurement;Face recognition;Security;Government","artificial intelligence;decision making;face recognition;security of data;video signal processing","AI system;application domains;abstract concepts;AI-based deception detection;multimodal deception detection;artificial intelligence systems;video processing;face recognition;video cues;audio cues;facial expressions","","2","","39","IEEE","19 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose to overcome this issue by using anomaly detection on multi-modal images for traversability classification, which is easily scalable by training in a self-supervised fashion from robot experience. In this work, we evaluate multiple anomaly detection methods with a combination of uni- and multi-modal images in their performance on data from different environmental conditions. Our results show that an approach using a feature extractor and normalizing flow with an input of RGB, depth and surface normals performs best.

The detection policy involves a robust, nonlinear deep learning approach that is capable of not only forecasting the operating states of the grid, but also can be effectively deployed by the operator to determine any attacks within the raw measurements. It is seen that such scalable models working in real-time promote a robust performance under measurement noise as well.

Especially, spatial information, body shape/posture and temporal evolution of actions are highlighted using illustrative representations obtained from a combination of dynamic RGB images, dynamic depth images and skeleton data representations. Therefore, each video is represented with three images that summarize the ongoing action. Our framework takes advantage of transfer learning from pre-trained models to extract significant features from these newly created images. Next, we fuse extracted features using Canonical Correlation Analysis and train a Long Short-Term Memory network to classify actions from visual descriptive images.

Various detection methods (e.g., lookup systems, fraud cue-based methods) have been proposed to identify phishing websites. The limitations of lookup systems (e.g., failing to address newly created attacks) and the fraud cue-based methods (e.g., relying on feature engineering) motivated the development of deep representation-based methods capable of learning deep fraud cues for enhanced anti-phishing capacity. Focusing mostly on URLs, these methods fail to analyze other two important modalities of website content: textual information and visual design. Moreover, the interpretability of these deep learning based methods is limited, reducing model trustworthiness and preventing relevant and actionable intelligence. As such, we propose a multi-modal hierarchical attention model (MMHAM) which jointly learns the deep fraud cues from the three major modalities of website content for phishing website detection. Specifically, MMHAM features an innovative shared dictionary learning approach for aligning representations from different modalities in the attention mechanism.

A series of events and activities are analyzed for feature selection to efficiently detect adversarial behavior. Selected feature vectors are used for model training during the implementation phase. A deep learning based approach is proposed that detects insiders with greater accuracy and low false positive rate.

The authors present the first general treatment of the coercion problem in secure computation. They first present a general definition of protocols that provide resilience to coercion. Their definition constitutes a natural extension of the general paradigm used for defining secure multiparty protocols. They next show that if trapdoor permutations exist then any function can be incoercibly computed (i.e., computed by a protocol that provides resilience to coercion) in the presence of computationally bounded adversaries and only public communication channels. This holds as long as less than half the parties are coerced (or corrupted). In particular, theirs are the first incoercible protocols without physical security assumptions.

The existing formal-based approaches for enforcing security policies are mainly expressed using first-order logic. A major drawback of using first-order logic in implementing dynamic policies is that new observations cannot override previously inferred consequences. In fact, a security system whose enterprise policies are implemented using first-order logic is required to have complete access to data in advance in order to be able to perform an informed reasoning and enforce restricting policies. As a major problem, the systems designed based on these first order logic-based approaches are often static, inflexible, and hard to manage and scale. This paper introduces an approach for expressing and enforcing adaptive access control policies dynamically. The paper presents a non-monotonic formal approach based on Answer Set Programming where default policies are explicitly separated from context-dependent and exception policies that often occur in dynamic systems and in particular when the required context data are unavailable ahead of time.

However, the mechanical design and locomotion strategies of current drones limit the size of the confined space that can be explored. In this work, we present a quadcopter capable of traversing long passageways 34% smaller than its nominal size. The combination of a soft morphing frame and multi-modal mobility allows the drone to exploit a new dynamic strategy for passageway traversal. The drone flies at a given speed towards the entrance of the passageway until it collides with it. The momentum and ability of the frame to soften allow the drone to passively fold and enter. Once the drone is squeezed between the walls of the passageway, it uses two tracks to crawl through. Through experiments, we characterize the main mechanical systems of the drone and study the entry into crevices of different sizes.","2475-8426","978-1-6654-1764-8","10.1109/SSRR53300.2021.9597683","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9597683","","Space exploration;Safety;Security;Mechanical systems;Robots;Drones","autonomous aerial vehicles;disasters;helicopters;mobile robots","soft drone;multimodal mobility;confined space;post-disaster scenarios;long passageways;narrow passageways;remote exploration;mechanical design;locomotion strategies;current drones;soft morphing frame;passageway traversal","","1","","19","IEEE","16 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is used to store, track, and analyze traffic that belongs to Virtual Networks (VNETs), Virtual Machines (VMs), or Network Interfaces (NICs). It is used for logging ingress and egress IP traffic flows, number of bytes and packets transmitted and received, and network connections. Flow logging is critical for the investigation of firewall functionalities, security incidents, and threat detection. Moreover, it can be used for detecting connection and network anomalies such as connection outages, configuration changes, or malicious activities. Alerts can be fired for any suspicious network activities. Visualization of flows logs provides insights such as who is using a web-service or an application, when customers are logged in and out, and what are the geographical locations where connections are being initiated or terminated. In this paper, a novel method for VNF that details the framework for logging network flows in a Cloud environment is provided. The method aims at accommodating multiple and simulations Cloud tenants and enabling the logging of network flows while at the same time accommodates high incoming rates of flow events and data. One of the major benefits of this new method is that it supports high number of flows per second that facilitates flow logging of high traffic volumes. Not only customers can experience higher number of flows logged, but the flow logs are visualized and contain the number of packets and bytes transmitted and received for outbound and inbound flows, respectively.","","978-1-5386-7693-6","10.1109/UEMCON.2018.8796641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8796641","Cloud;Distributed System;flow logging;virtualization;SDN;VNF","","cloud computing;computer network security;Internet;IP networks;network interfaces;telecommunication traffic;virtual machines;virtualisation","flow events;facilitates flow logging;high traffic volumes;flow logs;outbound;inbound;viewing;VNF;logging ingress;network connections;firewall functionalities;threat detection;detecting connection;connection outages;suspicious network activities;cloud environment;network analysis;virtualized network function;virtual networks;virtual machines;network interfaces;multiple simulations cloud tenants;advanced network flow logging;Microsoft azure distributed system","","1","","22","IEEE","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the existing IBHS schemes, which either handle only linear functions or has a large public key parameter and satisfies only the artificial notion of selective security. In this work, we construct the first leveled adaptively secure identity-based fully homomorphic signature (IBFHS) schemes without additional public parameters, which can be used to sign many different datasets. Thereby positively answering the open question of constructing a leveled IBFHS scheme with short public parameters, proposed by Wang et al., (ISC, 2015, Springer). We achieve the stronger security and better parameters by using the trapdoor vanishing and vector encoding technique. In our scheme, the size of every evaluated signature depends only logarithmically on the size of the input dataset, and the complexity of verifying a signature for a computation can be amortized when verifying the same computation on many different datasets.

In order to offer person-specific services for/of specific person a pre-identifying step should be done in the run-up. Using biometric in such application is encountered by diverse challenges. First, using one trait and excluding the others depends on the application aimed to. Some applications demand directly touch to biometric sensors, while others don't. Second challenge is the reliability of used biometric arrangement. Civilized application demands lower reliability comparing to the forensics ones. And third, for biometric system could only one trait be used (uni-modal systems) or multiple traits (Bi-or Multi-modal systems). The latter is applied, when systems with a relative high reliability are expected. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive view about biometric and its application.

Selection methods are typically based on the principle of identifying the effect of contingencies on multiple normalized performance indices and ranking them using the results. Presently used performance indices are highly nonlinear and they are known to mask the effects of single contingencies leading to misclassifications. In this paper, we propose two new methods, one relying on margin-based performance indices and another based on state sensitivity. New performance indices are proposed based on margins of 1) circuit loading, 2) bus voltages, and 3) reactive power. In addition, a state sensitivity method is proposed which estimates a system's post contingency operating state via a single iteration of the quadratized power flow model and provides estimates of post contingency line loading, bus voltages, and reactive power levels. Numerical experiments on a three phase version of the IEEE Reliability Test System show that the proposed performance indices yield more accurate results, at a computational cost comparable to a single power flow iteration. The state sensitivity method is more accurate in identifying critical contingencies but its computational cost is higher. The method has been also demonstrated in the larger PEGASE systems.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2555987","Power Systems Engineering Research Center (PSERC); National Science Foundation; Onassis Foundation; PSERC and the Onassis Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7457673","Contingency selection;online security analysis;unbalanced networks","Mathematical model;Security;Load flow;Indexes;Performance analysis;Sensitivity;Jacobian matrices","load flow;power engineering computing;power system reliability","fast online contingency selection;margin-based framework;unbalanced power systems is;circuit loading;bus voltages;reactive power;IEEE reliability test system;single power flow iteration","","5","","28","IEEE","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing literature proposes several techniques for data encryption but their computational complexity is a major bottleneck to meet strict latency requirements for the development of future multi-modal hearing aids. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a novel real-time audio/visual data encryption scheme based on chaos-based encryption using the Tangent-Delay Ellipse Reflecting Cavity-Map System (TD-ERCS) and Non-linear Chaotic (NCA) Algorithms.

However, a weakness of Monero's current blockchain data structure is that lightweight clients cannot authenticate the responses returned from a remote node. In this paper, we show that malicious responses from a remote node can lead to reduced privacy for the client. We discuss several lightweight mitigations that reduce the attack's effectiveness. To fully eliminate this class of attack, we also show how to augment Monero's blockchain data structure with an additional index that clients can use to authenticate responses from remote nodes.

We propose a multi-modal face authentication system, which pushes the limit of state-of-the-art image based face recognition solutions by incorporating a new dimension of sensing modality - acoustics. It actively emits almost inaudible acoustic signals from the earpiece speaker to ""illuminate"" the user's face and extracts features from the echoes using a customized convolutional neural network, which are fused with sophisticated visual features extracted from state-of-the-art face recognition models, for secure face authentication. Because the echo features depend on 3D facial geometries and material, our multi-modal design is not easily spoofed by images or videos like image based face recognition systems. It does not require any special sensors thus eliminating the extra costs in solutions like FaceID. Experiments show that our design achieves comparable face recognition performance to the state-of-the-art image based face authentication, while able to block image/video spoofing.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761776","","Face;Feature extraction;Authentication;Acoustics;Sensors;Visualization;Smart phones","convolutional neural nets;cryptography;face recognition;feature extraction","multimodal face authentication system;inaudible acoustic signals;multimodal design;deep visual features;convolutional neural network;face recognition performance;image based face authentication security;smartphones;feature extraction;3D facial geometries","","5","","24","IEEE","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such devices will however be broadly used only if they are ""prescribed"" by the hospitals as a part of a therapy and are reimbursed by the insurances. For this we need the proof of their safety, medical efficacy and economic efficiency. Aside of obligatory clinical trials we need an extensive system of post-market surveillance, because: a medical device is a part of a complex cyber-physical system, with humans in the loop / the environment cannot be sufficiently defined / humans react differently to the therapy, they also behave differently / after every software upgrade the device is not the same as before In their operation such devices generate huge amounts of data that can be reused for such analysis. Technically oriented people believe it can be done using a Big Data Analytics system without a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. It is doubtful if such approach can deliver useful results. The main problems seem to be: unbalanced cohort / various patient groups with various preferences / multiple quality parameters (basic algorithm, signal propagation, battery, security & privacy, obtrusiveness, etc.) / multiple variants (operating modes, device settings) / variability of the device and of the environment. When we transform data into ""actionable knowledge"", especially if the generated decisions influence human health, utmost care has to be applied. The goal of this paper is to present the complexity of the problem, warn against hasty, purely technical solutions, raise interest among specialists in health statistics and ignite an interdisciplinary cooperation to solve it.","","978-1-4673-9473-4","10.1109/3PGCIC.2015.96","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424592","Smart Medical Devices;Medical Statistics;Evidence Based Medicine","Software;Biomedical imaging;Hospitals;Biomedical monitoring;Smart phones;Monitoring;Batteries","Big Data;computational complexity;cyber-physical systems;data analysis;medical computing;socio-economic effects;statistical analysis","statistical challenges;quality assessment;smart medical devices;connected medicine;disruptive trend;health care;hospitals;insurances;medical efficacy;economic efficiency;obligatory clinical trials;post-market surveillance;complex cyber-physical system;software upgrade;technically oriented people;big data analytics system;unbalanced cohort;patient groups;multiple quality parameters;device variability;actionable knowledge;human health;problem complexity;health statistics","","2","","28","IEEE","3 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following the IEEE Standard 1547.4-2011, the operation and control of large distribution networks can be enhanced by dividing these networks into multiple virtual microgrids. The proposed planning framework incorporates the necessary conditions for microgrids to operate efficiently in grid-connected operating mode and successfully during islanding. To obtain a robust design, the clustering process considers three objectives: maximizing the self-adequacy of the designed microgrids, maximizing microgrid islanding success probability, and a combination of both targets. For this purpose, the PG&E distribution system with 69 buses is selected as a test case. Backtracking search optimization algorithm, a probabilistic load flow approach, and graph-based theories are used to accomplish this research. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the self-adequacy and the islanding success probability objectives in the clustering process. Compared with other strategies present in the previous literature, the proposed framework results in more self-sufficient and successful islands assessed in terms of active and reactive power adequacy as well as voltage constraints. Next, the effects of increased penetration level of DGs and installation of both distributed energy-storage units and distributed reactive sources on the design process are examined. Finally, a comparison with other microgrid design objectives applied in previous researches reveals that the resultant design is sensitive to the system's reliability, security, and economic requirements.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2019.2904319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8681447","Backtracking search;clustering;islanding;microgrid design;optimization;reactive sources;self-adequacy;storage units","Microgrids;Load modeling;Reliability;Planning;Probability density function;Islanding;Optimization","distributed power generation;energy storage;graph theory;IEEE standards;load flow;optimisation;power distribution control;power distribution economics;power distribution faults;power distribution planning;power distribution reliability;power generation control;power generation economics;power generation planning;power generation reliability;power system security;probability;reactive power","graph theory;economic requirements;system reliability;system security;voltage constraints;multiple virtual microgrids;IEEE Standard 1547;multiple distributed generation units;distribution networks;planning framework;design process;distributed energy-storage units;reactive power adequacy;active power adequacy;clustering process;load flow approach;backtracking search optimization algorithm;PG&E distribution system;microgrid islanding","","42","","46","IEEE","4 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It also supports a broadcaster to deliver the personalized messages to the individual authorized users simultaneously. However, none of the existing BEPM schemes consider the anonymity of authorized users, which is a crucial security requirement for many BEPM application scenarios. Besides, the previous studies on BEPM only achieve security against chosen-plaintext attack adversaries. Certificate-based cryptosystem gives a viable way to construct more secure and efficient BEPM schemes. We propose the new concept of anonymous certificate-based broadcast encryption with personalized messages (ANON-CBBE-PM). Subsequently, we illustrate the formal definition and the security model of ANON-CBBE-PM. Furthermore, we present an ANON-CBBE-PM scheme, which solves key escrow problem in identity-based cryptosystem and certificate management problem in traditional public key cryptosystem. Compared with the existing BEPM schemes, the proposed scheme not only protects the privacy of authorized users, but also has advantage in performance. To be more specific, the lengths of the user secret key and the system public parameters, as well as the cost for decryption are constant. For those BEPM applications with a multitude of users whose computing ability is limited, the proposed scheme is more practical. In addition, our scheme simultaneously achieves anonymity and confidentiality under adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack in the standard model.","1557-9611","","10.1109/TBC.2020.2984974","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972095,U1736112,61772009,61672207); Jiangsu Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:BK20161511); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2016B10114); Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Big Data Security & Intelligent Processing, NJUPT, and the Project of Scientific Research Innovation for College Graduate Student of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:KYZZ15_0151); Transverse Research Project of Huaiyin Institute of Technology(grant numbers:Z421A19815); Doctoral Scientific Research Starting Foundation of Huaiyin Institute of Technology(grant numbers:Z301B19563); Open Project of Jiangsu Internet of Things Mobile Internet Technology Engineering Laboratory(grant numbers:JSWLW-2017-007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9078860","Broadcast encryption;anonymity;chosen-ciphertext attack;standard model;adaptive security","Encryption;Adaptation models;Public key cryptography;Standards","authorisation;broadcast communication;data privacy;message authentication;private key cryptography;public key cryptography","adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack;system public parameters;traditional public key cryptosystem;key escrow problem;security model;formal definition;ANON-CBBE-PM;chosen-plaintext attack adversaries;encrypted broadcast message;cryptographic primitive;BEPM;user secret key;certificate management problem;identity-based cryptosystem;personalized messages;anonymous certificate-based broadcast encryption","","24","","54","IEEE","27 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we have formulated two novel distributed localization and tracking schemes, based on Gradient Descent and Extended Kalman Filter algorithms, to cope with erroneous GPS location. Sensor-rich vehicles exploit Vehicle-to-Vehicle communications and a multitude of integrated sensors, like LIDAR and Cameras, to generate and fuse heterogeneous data. Each vehicle interacts only with its own connected neighboring vehicles, formulating individual star topologies. Extensive simulation studies using CARLA autonomous driving simulator, verify the significant reduction of GPS error achieved by the two methods in various experimental conditions.

Most organizations perform risk management to manage their information security. Generally, they use the information system risk assessment (ISRA). However, the method has difficulties supporting sufficiently analyzing security risks and actively responding to these attacks due to the limitations of asset-driven qualitative evaluation activities.

In this paper, we have combined for the first time textual, contextual and interpersonal communicative information of users in online social networks to develop a biometric system. The SBB traits are combined using the weighted sum rule score level fusion algorithm with the genetic algorithm employed to choose the feature weights. The effects of template aging on the individual SBB traits and overall system have been analyzed for the first time.

Before deploying traditional CP-ABE in real mHealth applications, there are three concerns worth considering. First, the scale of pre-defined attribute universe is lack of scalability. Second, the plaintext access policy sent along with the ciphertext would leak the PHR owner’s privacy. Third, it is difficult to identify the malicious user who intentionally disclosed his (partial or modified) private key. In this paper, we present HTAC, a fine-grained policy-hiding and traceable access control scheme for mHealth. In HTAC, the attribute universe is exponentially large and unbounded. Each attribute is expressed by an attribute name and an attribute value. In the encryption phase, the value is hidden in the ciphertext and only the generic attribute name is exposed. The malicious user will be precisely identified by searching the identity linked with the suspicious private key in an identity table. We further extend HTAC by removing the identity table and assigning more explicitly responsibility for the authority and the trace center. Then the storage overhead of tracing the malicious users is constant. The security analysis and performance comparison indicate that HTAC and the extended scheme are secure and practicable for real mHealth.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3004897","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFC1314903); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872088,61941116,61502248); Major Science Research Project of Jiangsu Provincial Education Department(grant numbers:19KJA310010); National Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2019J01276); Innovation Capability Support Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2020KJXX-052); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2019KW-053,2020ZDLGY08-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9133097","Large universe;partially hidden access policy;traceable CP-ABE;adaptive security","Access control;Medical services;Encryption;Indexes;Systems architecture","authorisation;data privacy;electronic health records;health care;mobile computing;private key cryptography","private key;identity table;HTAC;ciphertext policy attribute based encryption;CP-ABE;mobile healthcare systems;mHealth;plaintext access policy;traceable access control;policy-hiding;personal health record privacy","","14","","44","CCBY","3 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, erroneous camera registrations due to noisy motor encoder readings, a faulty kinematic model or other error sources can drastically reduce the model quality. Most existing approaches register the pose of a free-floating single camera without considering constraints by the kinematic robot configuration. In contrast, ARM-SLAM [1] performs dense localization and mapping in the configuration space of the robot arm, implicitly tracking the pose of a single camera and creating a volumetric model. However, using a single camera only allows to cover a small field of view and can only constrain up to six degrees of freedom. Therefore, we propose the Multi-Cam ARM-SLAM (MC-ARM-SLAM) framework, which fuses information of multiple depth cameras mounted on the robot into a joint model. The use of multiple cameras allows to also estimate the motion of the robot base that is modeled as a virtual kinematic chain additionally to the motion of the arm. Furthermore, we use a robust bivariate error formulation, which helps to boost the accuracy of the method and mitigates the influence of outliers. The proposed method is extensively evaluated in simulation and on a real rescue robot. It is shown that the method is able to correct errors in the motor encoders and the kinematic model and outperforms the base version of ARM-SLAM.","2475-8426","978-1-6654-5680-7","10.1109/SSRR56537.2022.10018752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018752","","Robot vision systems;Kinematics;Cameras;Manipulators;Safety;Registers;Security","cameras;dexterous manipulators;image reconstruction;image registration;image sensors;manipulator kinematics;mobile robots;path planning;robot vision;SLAM (robots)","camera registrations;faulty kinematic model;kinematic robot configuration;MC-ARM-SLAM;model quality;multicam ARM-SLAM framework;multiple depth cameras;noisy motor encoder readings;registered depth images;rescue robot;robot arm;robot base;robust multimodal state estimation;truncated signed distance functions;volumetric model","","","","19","IEEE","24 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even the most cutting-edge cloud providers are experiencing an inordinate strain as a result of the growing number of consumer and corporate devices connected to the IoT. While it has a centralized design, it lacks bandwidth and has downtime issues. High latency, lack of location awareness, outage concerns, etc., are among the issues that cloud services for IoT confront. Furthermore, due to uninterrupted operating states, the massive volume of data created by the IoT is increasing enormously. IoT devices are creating a flood of data, disrupting predictable data processing and analytics capabilities well managed by the cloud. As a result, securing this ocean of data has become an elite concern for researchers and cyber experts, as organizations jeopardize their reputation and users’ privacy and security.

However, this opens up the threat of theft of Intellectual Property (IP) since the system configuration is stored in easy-to-access Flash memory. To prevent this, high-end FPGAs have already been extended with symmetric-key decryption engines used to load an encrypted version of the configuration that cannot simply be copied and used without knowledge of the secret key. However, such protection systems based on straightforward use of symmetric cryptography are not well-suited with respect to business and licensing processes, since they are lacking a convenient scheme for key transport and installation. We propose a new protection scheme for the IP of circuits in configuration bit files that provides a significant improvement to the current unsatisfying situation. It uses both public-key and symmetric cryptography, but does not burden FPGAs with the usual overhead of public-key cryptography: While it needs hard-wired symmetric cryptography, the public-key functionality is moved into a temporary configuration bit stream for a one-time setup procedure. This approach requires only very few modifications to current FPGA technology.

The accuracy of the face detection system relies on the quality of the image registration procedure. In this paper, we propose an enhanced intensity-based image registration technique for thermal and visible facial images. The method uses a histogram matching scheme to equalize the intensity levels of the IR/visible images for proper image registration.

Moreover, the techniques we describe can be applied not only separately, but can also be combined into coordinated attack graph views. We apply improved visual clustering to previously described network protection domains (attack graph cliques), which reduces graph complexity and makes the overall attack flow easier to understand. We also visualize the attack graph adjacency matrix, which shows patterns of network attack while avoiding the clutter usually associated with drawing large graphs. We show how the attack graph adjacency matrix concisely conveys the impact of network configuration changes on attack graphs. We also describe a novel attack graph filtering technique based on the interactive navigation of a hierarchy of attack graph constraints.

This is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation (GA). Robust and resilient detection, identification, localization, and tracking of sUAS sharing UAM airspace is complicated by urban factors such as non-transmitting, non-cooperative drones. Exacerbating these challenges, current technological limitations and vulnerabilities in Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can pose safety and security threats. To streamline a vision of safe and secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace, we propose Drone Net, a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) network of multi-modal ground and flight instruments. Drone Net is an architecture fusing a network of passive visual and acoustic sensor nodes with active Radio Detection and Ranging (radar) and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensing methods for UTM, designed for integration with existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and future UAM systems. The purpose of the Drone Net system is to evaluate use of Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic arrays networked within an urban UAS operating region such as uncontrolled Class-G and waiver-granted Class-D airspace. The Drone Net approach combines detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADS-B, and EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe, fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network. Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS that are both compliant and non-compliant alongside GA and UAM more safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more advanced scenarios between multiple UAS. The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time for analysis and security applications. More concrete applications for Drone Net include UTM integration with ATC and UAM, but also airspace safety and security for campus and public venues in general. Herein, we will present our experimental design and current test data from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in collaboration with University of Colorado Boulder toward completing the open specification for ground and flight instruments. We would additionally like to invite others to participate in growing the network and the data available for UTM, UAM, and GA shared airspace research.","2155-7209","978-1-7281-0649-6","10.1109/DASC43569.2019.9081710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9081710","fail-safe;fail-secure;UAS;UTM;UAM;GPS;ADS-B","","aerospace computing;air traffic control;aircraft navigation;autonomous aerial vehicles;cloud computing;control engineering computing;data mining;Global Positioning System;inertial navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;sensor fusion","inertial navigation systems;security threats;safe sUAS-UAM shared airspace;secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace;passive visual sensor nodes;acoustic sensor nodes;air traffic control;acoustic arrays;urban UAS operating region;Class-D airspace;Drone Net approach;ground radar;Drone Net network;fail-secure property;ground sensor network;ground-system sensor fusion;UTM flight plan;fail-secure methods;multiple UAS;regional cloud-based networks;multisensor drone detection;Drone Net project;global cloud-based networks;UAS traffic management network;fail-safe experiments;ADS-B;GPS;Global Positioning System;UAM airspace;UAM vehicles;heterogeneous drone shapes;innovative aviation designs;air taxi service;urban air mobility;unmanned aerial systems;urban airspace;UAM traffic;fail-secure experiments;flight instruments;airspace safety;flight sensor network","","7","","43","IEEE","30 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the first scheme to achieve the feature mentioned above, FABRIC not only enjoys constant computation overhead in the encryption, decryption, and re-encryption phases when the quantity of attributes increases, but is also unbounded such that the new attributes or roles could be adopted into the system anytime. Furthermore, FABRIC achieves adaptive security under the decisional linear assumption (DLIN). Eventually, detailed theoretical and experimental analysis proved that FABRIC enjoys excellent performance in efficiency and practicality in the cloud computing scenario.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2023.3240820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10032798","Cloud computing;cross-domain data sharing;encrypted data sharing;privacy;security","Cloud computing;Fabrics;Public key;Encryption;Transforms;Servers;Security","","","","","","","IEEE","31 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we are the first to reveal the vulnerability of AVASD models under audio-only, visual-only, and audio-visual adversarial attacks through extensive experiments. What's more, we also propose a novel audio-visual interaction loss (AVIL) for making attackers difficult to find feasible adversarial examples under an allocated attack budget. The loss aims at pushing the inter-class embeddings to be dispersed, namely non-speech and speech clusters, sufficiently disentangled, and pulling the intra-class embeddings as close as possible to keep them compact.

However, it has been extensively recognized that the IoT-enabled communication network of power systems is vulnerable to cyberattacks. In particular, system operating states, critical attributes that act as input to the data-driven stability assessment, can be manipulated by malicious actors to mislead the system operator into making disastrous decisions and thus cause major blackouts and cascading events. In this paper, we explore the vulnerability of the data-driven power system stability assessment, with a special emphasis on decision tree-based stability assessment (DTSA) approaches, and investigate the feasibility of constructing a physics-constrained adversarial attack (PCAA) to undermine the DTSA. The PCAA is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem considering the misclassification constraint, power limits, and bad data detection, computing potential adversarial perturbations that reverse the “stable/unstable” prediction of the real-time input while remaining invisible/stealthy. Extensive experiments based on the IEEE 68-bus system are conducted to evaluate the impact of PCAAs on predictions of DTSA and their transferability.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3264492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10100624","Cyber Security;Transient Stability Assessment;Decision Trees;Physics-Constrained Machine Learning;Adversarial Examples","Power system stability;Stability criteria;Power measurement;Perturbation methods;Voltage measurement;Phasor measurement units;Transmission line measurements","","","","","","","IEEE","11 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Since the total production loss from both events was quite large, some improvements have been implemented to prevent the recurrence of similar events in the future. They consist of installing the sequence of events recorder at the generator output terminal, regulating the generator lagging power factor operation from 0.95-0.99 to 0.91, adjusting the tap position to decrease the secondary voltage of the 161 kV/161 kV interconnecting transformer, operating the phase-leading capacitors attached with a multi-stage chain cut-off control unit, and running two or three generators in automatic voltage regulation mode instead of automatic power factor regulation mode. Although similar events occurred twice at the same power plant in 2006, the generating units were capable of continuous stable operation which had effectively verified the improvements of operational changes. In conclusion, we suggest that the operating modes of generators in a cogeneration plant should reexamine constantly as well as monitor power quality of different end-user sectors continuously in order to ensure the security of power-system operation.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2105894","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5712191","Automatic power factor regulation;automatic voltage regulation;cogeneration power plant;generator loss-of-field","Generators;Reactive power;Cogeneration;Automatic voltage control;Capacitors;Power quality","cogeneration;power capacitors;power supply quality;power system security;power transformers;synchronous generators;thermal power stations","cogeneration thermal power plant;Taiwan;synchronous machine stability events;generator loss-of-field;production loss;event recorder;generator lagging power factor operation;interconnecting transformer;phase-leading capacitors;multistage chain cut-off control unit;automatic voltage regulation mode;automatic power factor regulation mode;continuous stable operation;power quality monitoring;power system operation security","","14","","7","IEEE","14 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the last years, a not negligible part of the scientific community started to apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to image-based representations of the audio stream, due to their successful adoption in almost all the computer vision tasks. In this paper, we carry out a detailed benchmark of various widely used CNN architectures and visual representations on a popular dataset, namely the MIVIA Audio Events database. Our analysis is aimed at understanding how these factors affect the sound event recognition performance with a particular focus on the false positive rate, very relevant in audio surveillance solutions. In fact, although most of the proposed solutions achieve a high recognition rate, the capability of distinguishing the events-of-interest from the background is often not yet sufficient for real systems, and prevent its usage in real applications. Our comprehensive experimental analysis investigates this aspect and allows to identify useful design guidelines for increasing the specificity of sound event recognition systems.","1051-4651","978-1-7281-8808-9","10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9412573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9412573","","Visualization;Time-frequency analysis;Surveillance;Benchmark testing;Streaming media;Visual databases;Security","audio signal processing;audio streaming;convolutional neural nets;image representation;neural net architecture;surveillance","audio surveillance systems;sound event recognition systems;convolutional neural networks;image-based representations;audio stream;computer vision tasks;CNN architectures;visual representations;MIVIA Audio Events database;sound event recognition performance;audio surveillance solutions;events-of-interest;comprehensive experimental analysis","","1","","25","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, security aspects are a major concern for IoT devices due to their applications and the amount of sensitive data they provide. Simultaneously, the energy constraint in IoT networks remains a significant issue due to their limited resources. To reduce their energy consumption, several IoT protocols have integrated the energy-saving mode which offers four operating modes. On the basis of these four states, we derive an analysis framework, named HARPAGON, allowing an attacker to maximize his attack efficiency and minimize his impact in terms of energy consumption. Indeed, the effectiveness of many attacks depends principally on the state of the attacker and the victim at the same time. HARPAGON with the help of Markov chain theory allows modeling the interaction between the attacker and its victims. In this article, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework coupled with a jamming attack by comparing it to other types of jamming attacks. Experimental results reveal HARPAGON combined with a jamming attack drastically reduces the performance of the network, with an impact on the packet error rate (PER), which is around 13% higher than the reactive attack and with a reduced energy budget in respect of the other two well-known “green” jamming attacks.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3172849","Grant from CPER DATA; General Armament Direction, France; Defense Innovation Agency, France; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9769761","Energy effective;green attacks;Internet of Things (IoT);Markov chain theory;wireless networks","Jamming;Transmitters;Protocols;Internet of Things;Energy consumption;Wireless communication;Security","computer network management;computer network security;energy conservation;energy consumption;energy management systems;Internet of Things;jamming;Markov processes;protocols;telecommunication power management","Markov chain theory;packet error rate;PER;green jamming attack efficiency;energy consumption constraint;HARPAGON;reactive attack efficiency;energy-saving mode;IoT protocols;IoT device networks;energy management framework;reduced energy budget","","","","20","IEEE","5 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key observations that enable us to discover this sidechannel are: 1) in an effort to manage and minimize power consumption, modern microprocessors have a number of possible operating modes (power states) in which various sub-systems of the processor are powered down, 2) for some of the transitions between power states, the processor also changes the operating mode of the voltage regulator module (VRM) that supplies power to the affected sub-system, and 3) the electromagnetic (EM) emanations from the VRM are heavily dependent on its operating mode. As a result, these state-dependent EM emanations create a side-channel which can potentially reveal sensitive information about the current state of the processor and, more importantly, the programs currently being executed. To demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting this vulnerability, we create a covert channel by utilizing the changes in the processor's power states. We show how such a covert channel can be leveraged to exfiltrate sensitive information from a secured and completely isolated (air-gapped) laptop system by placing a compact, inexpensive receiver in proximity to that system. To further show the severity of this attack, we also demonstrate how such a covert channel can be established when the target and the receiver are several meters away from each other, including scenarios where the receiver and the target are separated by a wall. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed covert channel has >3x higher bit-rate. Finally, to demonstrate that this new vulnerability is not limited to being used as a covert channel, we demonstrate how it can be used for attacks such as keystroke logging.","2378-203X","978-1-7281-6149-5","10.1109/HPCA47549.2020.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9065580","Side-Channel;Microarchitecture Vulnerability;DVFS;Power Management.","Switches;Voltage control;Regulators;Capacitors;Power system management;Phasor measurement units;Receivers","computer power supplies;microprocessor chips;power consumption;security of data;voltage regulators","voltage regulator module;electromagnetic-based side-channel;microarchitectural vulnerability;power management unit;side-channel vulnerability;electromagnetic emanations;modern microprocessors;power consumption;modern computers","","15","","101","IEEE","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many factors influence crop yield, such as soil, amount of water, climate, and genotype. Determining factors that significantly influence yield prediction and identify the most appropriate predictive methods are important in yield management. It is critical to consider and study the combination of different crop factors and their impact on the yield. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to use advanced data analytic techniques to precisely predict the soybean crop yields, (2) to identify the most influential features that impact soybean predictions, (3) to illustrate the ability of Fuzzy Rule-Based (FRB) sub-systems, which are self-organizing, self-learning, and data-driven, by using the recently developed Autonomous Learning Multiple-Model First-order (ALMMo-1) system, and (4) to compare the performance with other well-known methods. The ALMMo-1 system is a transparent model, which stakeholders can easily read and interpret. The model is a data-driven and composed of prototypes selected from the actual data. Many factors affect the yield, and data clouds can be formed in the feature/data space based on the data density. The data cloud is the key to the IF part of FRB sub-systems, while the THEN part (the consequences of the IF condition) illustrates the yield prediction in the form of a linear regression model, which consists of the yield features or factors. In addition, the model can determine the most influential features of the yield prediction online. The model shows an excellent prediction accuracy with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0883, and Non-Dimensional Error Index (NDEI) of 0.0611, which is competitive with state-of-the-art methods.","","978-1-7281-2946-4","10.1109/SNAMS.2019.8931888","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8931888","Autonomous Learning;Fuzzy Rule-Based;Multi-Modal;Linear regression;Soybean yield prediction","Agriculture;Data models;Predictive models;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Security;Data analysis","agriculture;crops;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;regression analysis;soil","soybean yield prediction;machine learning;advanced data analytics;yield management;soybean crop yields;ALMMo-1 system;data cloud;data density;linear regression model;autonomous learning multiple-model first-order system;fuzzy rule-based subsystem;soybean predictions","","5","","29","IEEE","16 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since most of the produced energy from distributed renewable sources arises as electricity, electrification of energy consumers and producers, called prosumers, expands. In this context, multimodal distribution grids make use of the storage capabilities of other energy sectors like heat, and abolish the supply-dependency and uncertainty of the feed-in of decentralized generators. This provides flexibility in the energy system, which increases security of supply and at the same time ensures economical energy provision. The subject of this paper is to exploit the flexibility of such a multi-modal energy system for operation in an optimal way. The cellular approach serves here as the energy system architecture. Aim is to provide flexibility with a cell by optimally distributing a flexibility request to subordinate prosumers changing their active and reactive power. The load change is hereby to be optimally dispatched to the different components of the prosumers under consideration of technical restrictions and dynamic behavior of components, the grids and economical aspects. For dynamic modelling and simulation the open-source modelling language Modelica is used. Using a lowvoltage benchmark model expanded by multi-modal technologies, the proposed methodology shows that the cells are capable of providing flexibility to the overlying grid with high accuracy at low costs.","","978-3-8007-6108-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172983","","","","","","","","","","4 Jul 2023","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

However, the robustness of the recognition process becomes a major problem. When identifying unseen categories with traditional finger-vein recognition systems, a few issues remain, such as recognition interference and low efficiency. This paper proposes a Deep Generalized Label Finger-Vein (DGLFV) model to extract feature maps and achieve high-accuracy recognition. The largest rectangular finger-vein region is extracted through image semantic segmentation and the advanced bidirectional traversing and center diffusion method for the known categories. Then we generalize all the unseen categories actively as Class  $C+1$  to reduce interference from unregistered users.

The distribution network reconfiguration technique is often performed to improve these voltage levels, if not to reduce power losses. However, distribution systems feed various kinds of consumers, and their power demand dependency on bus voltages is different based on their load type. Modifying the network configuration changes the system's nodal voltage levels, and then the load power is also impacted after the reconfiguration. Only a few research works in the field of distribution system reconfiguration have included load power dependency to nodal voltages in their proposed models. However, these studies have not discussed whether adding voltage-depend loads to the reconfiguration problem is beneficial or only increases the computational efforts without substantial gains on the optimal solution. With the intention to fill this gap, this article develops a comprehensive analysis of how the change of load according to the voltage affects reconfiguration solutions. This investigation aims to help distribution system researchers and readers understand this phenomenon and highlight the benefits and drawbacks of taking it into account. Also, a robust reconfiguration model for considering load types and nodal voltage is proposed. The model is validated in different network models and sizes, where the obtained results are compared with other models presented in the literature. The results analysis indicates that voltage fluctuations impact the distribution network configuration through voltage effect on power losses and the system nodal loads. Also, load voltage-dependent models are more flexible than constant demand based-formulations in finding feasible solutions in more restricted voltage tolerances.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2023.3278801","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10142233","Distribution system;load type;network re-configuration;power demand;voltage fluctuations","Load modeling;Voltage;Mathematical models;Computational modeling;Distribution networks;Analytical models;Voltage control","","","","","","","IEEE","1 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, most of the research achievements regarding to the game models are based on the hypothesis that both the two sides' players are completely rational, which is hard to meet. Therefore, we combined the evolutionary game theory and Markov decisionmaking process to construct a multi-stage Markov evolutionary game model for network attack-defense analysis, in view of the bounded rationality constraint. The model, based on the non-cooperative evolutionary game theory, could accomplish dynamic analysis and deduction for the multi-stage and multi-state network attack-defense process. In addition, an objective function with discounted total payoffs was designed by analyzing payoff characteristics of the multi-stage evolutionary game, which is more consistent with the reality of network attack and defense. Besides, the solving method for multi-stage game equilibrium was proposed on the basis of calculating the single-stage evolutionary game equilibrium. In addition, an algorithm for optimal defense strategy of the multi-stage evolutionary games was given.

However, existing systems based on a single authentication factor contains one major security weakness - unauthorized physical access to the token, e.g., during lunch-time or upon theft, allows the attacker to have unfettered access to the terminal. We introduce ZEMFA, a zero-effort multi-factor authentication system based on multiple authentication tokens and multi-modal behavioral biometrics. Specifically, ZEMFA utilizes two types of authentication tokens, a smartphone and a smartwatch (or a bracelet) and two types of gait patterns captured by these tokens, mid/lower body movements measured by the phone and wrist/arm movements captured by the watch. Since a user's walking or gait pattern is believed to be unique, only that user (no impostor) would be able to gain access to the terminal even when the impostor is given access to both of the authentication tokens. We present the design and implementation of ZEMFA. We demonstrate that ZEMFA offers a high degree of detection accuracy, based on multi-sensor and multi-device fusion. We also show that ZEMFA can resist active attacks that attempt to mimic a user's walking pattern, especially when multiple devices are used.","2643-4202","978-1-7281-3265-5","10.1109/PST47121.2019.8949032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949032","Authentication;Biometrics;Walking-pattern;Phone;Wearables;Sensors;Context","","authorisation;biometrics (access control);gait analysis;mobile computing;smart phones","ZEMFA;multimodal gait biometrics;zero-effort authentication;authentication token;single authentication factor;zero-effort multifactor authentication system;multisensor fusion;multidevice fusion","","4","","55","IEEE","6 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wireless sensor networks play significant role in building such systems as they can effectively act as the human-physical interface with the digital world through sensing, communication, computing and control or actuation. However, the inherent characteristics of wireless sensor networks, typified by resource constraints, high degree of uncertainty, heterogeneity and distributed control pose significant challenges. After introducing the basic challenges, opportunities and applications, this talk will present a novel framework for multi-modal context recognition from sensor streaming data, context-aware data fusion, and situation-aware decision making with a trade-off between information accuracy (hence inference quality) and energy consumption. The underlying approach is based on dynamic Bayesian model, information theoretic reasoning, and game theory.

Existing published work on robustness either does not scale to large-scale dataset, or does not deal with multiple modalities. This work aims to study several key questions related to multi-modal learning through the lens of robustness: 1) Are multi-modal models necessarily more robust than uni-modal models? 2) How to efficiently measure the robustness of multi-modal learning? 3) How to fuse different modalities to achieve a more robust multi-modal model? To understand the robustness of the multi-modal model in a large-scale setting, we propose a density-based metric, and a convexity metric to efficiently measure the distribution of each modality in high-dimensional latent space. Our work provides a theoretical intuition together with empirical evidence showing how multi-modal fusion affects adversarial robustness through these metrics. We further devise a mix-up strategy based on our metrics to improve the robustness of the trained model. Our experiments on AudioSet [1] and Kinetics-Sounds [2] verify our hypothesis that multi-modal models are not necessarily more robust than their uni-modal counterparts in the face of adversarial examples. We also observe our mix-up trained method could achieve as much protection as traditional adversarial training, offering a computationally cheap alternative.","2379-190X","978-1-6654-0540-9","10.1109/ICASSP43922.2022.9746124","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9746124","","Measurement;Training;Visualization;Computational modeling;Surveillance;Signal processing;Robustness","audio signal processing;audio-visual systems;Gaussian processes;image fusion;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;sensor fusion","adversarial robustness;large-scale audio visual learning;audio-visual systems;large-scale dataset;multiple modalities;multimodal learning;uni-modal models;robust multimodal model;multimodal fusion;uni-modal counterparts","","2","","23","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The electricity supply industry structure under the government of Thailand has been managed by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, the Metropolitan Electricity Authority, and the Provincial Electricity Authority for almost 50 years. According to the 2004 Power Development Plan, the country would have generation reserve at a marginal of 15%. Due to the rapid economic growth and difficulty in building new centralized generating facilities, this has the potential to create a security issue of electricity energy shortage and may develop a severe system blackout. Renewable energy issues have been widely discussed and debated over the country. Although solar energy is the most prominent renewable energy source due to the appropriate geographic of Thailand, it is still considered as a low-density energy source which requires a large area of installation. Therefore, for the long-term investment, wind power seems to be a good candidate because it is quick to install, needs no fuel cost, and is environment friendly. Therefore, this paper investigates the impact of the penetration level of wind power generation to be integrated into the Thailand system. System stability has been observed in various system configuration changes due to different control strategies of wind farms.

A multimodal biometric template protection approach with fusion at score level using fingerprint and face templates is proposed. The proposed approach includes two basic stages, enrollment stage and verification stage. During the enrollment stage, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied on the face images to embed the fingerprint features into different directional sub-bands. Watermark embedding and extraction are done by quantizing the mean values of the wavelet coefficients. Subsequently, the inverse DWT is applied to obtain the watermarked image. Following this, a unique token is assigned for each genuine user and a hyper-chaotic map is used to produce a key stream in order to encrypt a watermarked image using block-cipher. The experimentation results indicate the efficiency of the proposed approach in term of achieving a reasonable error rate of 3.87%.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxz047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9104637","multi-modal biometric template protection;watermarking;biometric encryption;block-cipher;token;hyper-chaotic map","","","","","2","","","","1 Jun 2020","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The resulting violence or crime leads to terrible consequences. How to utilize reasonable means to predict the dangerous intentions of massive crowds and prevent the potential hazard to the public is significant for social security. A crowd monitoring and management system is an effective way to detect abnormal behavior. In this article, we release unmanned aerial vehicles as well as fixed ground devices to achieve multi-level and multi-modal behavioral sensing on a massive crowd, deploy a hybrid model in edge cloud to extract global features from behavioral data of a massive crowd, and then utilize these global features to construct decent classification algorithms for action recognition and behavioral semantic cognition. With the cooperation of behavioral data and cognitive algorithms, we can understand the instantaneous emotions of the crowd. On the basis of behavioral data and the emotional state of the crowd, the correlation between daily behavior and any dangerous intention of a massive crowd has been revealed by utilizing behavioral big data analysis, which is a key foundation for predicting people's dangerous intentions. Finally, we conduct a case study of abnormal behavior detection based on pix2pix and continuous video frames. The experimental results show that the performance of our method is better than other algorithms in both public datasets and the customized Hajj dataset.

The approach uses RECO, a surprisal-based metric that captures key features of an ecosystem's resilient structure, as an objective to strategically design the electrical network. The approach enables solvability and practicality by introducing a stochastic-based candidate branch creation algorithm and a Taylor series expansion for relaxation of the RECO formulation. Finally, studies are conducted on the RECO-oriented approach using the IEEE 24 Bus RTS and the ACTIVSg200 systems.

However, one major issue pertinent to unimodal system remains. It has to do with actual biometric characteristics of users being permanent, and their number being limited. Thus, if user's biometric is compromised, it might be impossible or highly difficult to replace it in a particular system. Cancellable biometric for individual biometric has been a significantly understudied problem. The concept of cancelable biometric or cancelability is to transform a biometric data or feature into a new one so that users can change their single biometric template in a biometric security system. However, cancelability in multimodal biometric has been barely addressed at all. In this paper, we tackle the problem and present a novel solution for cancelable biometrics in multimodal system. We develop a new cancelable biometric template generation algorithm using random projection and transformation-based feature extraction and selection. Performance of the proposed algorithm is validated on multi-modal face and ear database.","","978-1-4673-2795-4","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2012.6311208","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6311208","pattern recognition;decision-making;multimodal cancelabile biometrics;security","Biometrics (access control);Databases;Face;Principal component analysis;Ear;Cryptography","biometrics (access control);ear;face recognition;feature extraction;visual databases","multimodal cancelable biometric template generation algorithm;unimodal biometric system;intraclass variability;interclass similarity;data quality;nonuniversality;noise sensitivity;biometric security system;random projection;transformation-based feature extraction;transformation-based feature selection;multimodal face database;multimodal ear database","","35","","26","IEEE","24 Sep 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike traditional crowd monitoring systems, which make use of simplex forms of different data types, data and information associated with crowded scenarios can be collected, fused, processed and analyzed in large quantities for accurate global assessment and enhanced decision making processes in an ICMMS. Therefore, data fusion is introduced as an enabler to decrease data quantity, reduce data dimensions, and improve data quality. In this paper, we first survey the literature on data fusion application in crowd monitoring systems as we are developing a state-of-the-art ICMMS with data fusion as a major platform enabler. Next, we discuss some popular data fusion architectures and classifications from different perspectives. Based on this, we propose a multi-sensor, multi-modal, and dimensional ICMMS architecture based on data fusion.

Traditional biometrics primary focus is on person identification. However, via soft biometric processing, different general information of a user may be exploited. A multimodal approach has a lot of potential to overcome several fundamental constraints of a unimodal scheme when it comes to security, privacy, and identification. It is observed that there has been a surge in passion for widening biometric prediction capabilities to include easily quantifiable factors like the subject's age, and more recently, advanced qualities like emotional or mental states. In this regard, multimodal biometric features of a person are used to predict their corresponding age using a deep convolutional neural network. The datasets used in this study are acquired locally using a customized hardware setup, and this database includes the palm print, palm vein, dorsal vein, and wrist vein images of an individual. The features of each biometric are extracted and fused at the score level, followed by the age prediction using a tailored deep convolutional neural network. A Sequential model is built, and Adam optimization is applied, and the loss function of the model is determined by mean squared error values. The obtained error values from the model show decent error rates for different learning percentages. The experimental results obtained using the proposed method are competitive to previous studies.","","978-1-6654-3888-9","10.1109/MysuruCon52639.2021.9641556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9641556","Biometric;Convolutional Neural Network;Deep learning;Fusion;Multimodal biometric","Wrist;Deep learning;Biometrics (access control);Error analysis;Veins;Biological system modeling;Feature extraction","convolutional neural nets;data privacy;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image classification;image fusion;vein recognition","emotional states;mental states;multimodal biometric features;palm vein;dorsal vein;wrist vein images;tailored deep convolutional neural network;multimodal biometric age prediction;deep learning framework;traditional biometrics primary focus;person identification;soft biometric processing;unimodal scheme;privacy;biometric prediction capabilities;quantifiable factors;learning percentages","","","","41","IEEE","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When processing these digital transactions, recognizing each merchant’s real identity (i.e., business type) is vital to ensure the integrity of payment processing systems. Conventionally, this problem is formulated as a time series classification problem solely using the merchant transaction history. However, with the large scale of the data, and changing behaviors of merchants and consumers over time, it is extremely challenging to achieve satisfying performance from off-the-shelf classification methods. In this work, we approach this problem from a multi-modal learning perspective, where we use not only the merchant time series data but also the information of merchant-merchant relationship (i.e., affinity) to verify the self-reported business type (i.e., merchant category) of a given merchant. Specifically, we design two individual encoders, where one is responsible for encoding temporal information and the other is responsible for affinity information, and a mechanism to fuse the outputs of the two encoders to accomplish the identification task. Our experiments on real-world credit card transaction data between 71,668 merchants and 433,772,755 customers have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378417","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378417","Credit Card Transactions;Merchant Category;Multi-modal Learning;Time Series;Classification","Industries;Time series analysis;Big Data;Credit cards;Data models;Task analysis;Business","bank data processing;credit transactions;electronic commerce;financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;time series;transaction processing","merchants;changing behaviors;merchant transaction history;time series classification problem;payment processing systems;digital transactions;online shops;digital payment volume;credit card transactions;merchant category identification;755 customers;real-world credit card transaction data;identification task;affinity information;temporal information;given merchant;business type;merchant-merchant relationship;merchant time series data;multimodal learning perspective;off-the-shelf classification methods;satisfying performance","","","1","40","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper explores the possibility of combining features from the same biometric trait (fingerprints) i.e. keeping it unimodal but still offering the same security as that of the combined biometrics. In this paper, using minutiae and orientation features from two different fingerprints, a new unique mixed fingerprint template is generated. The advantage of creating the mixed template is that it is cancellable and serves as a new virtual identity. Further Gabor feature of the mixed template is extracted before matching to reduce the error rate. Testing the templates is done using 2 methods, viz: correlation based and minutiae based. These two methods were effective in identifying the templates accurately.

Based on the generated fingerprints, we propose a novel traffic classification framework. The proposed system generates profiles of normal applications using a multi-modal probability distribution. The proposed classification framework is then extended to detect distributed denial of service attacks from the collected statistical information at flow level. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system, we evaluate its performance using five real-world traffic datasets.

According to the WHO, good health is not only about zero sicknesses or disability but is also about physical well-being, sound mental state and social and spiritual welfare. The technological implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in mental health has vast potential for personalizing treatment selection, prognostication, and relapse monitoring. Moreover, it provides remedies to reduce stress and anxiety for situations that do not require immediate and necessary medical intrusion and emergency contacts and services in case of a severe condition. Particularly, to discern depressive behaviours, multi-modal data is used to examine and exploit a large variety of parameters. Unlike the usual method of having an observational study that is done by taking surveys or questionnaires, the AI model helps us to understand and explore the inconspicuous and reliable detection of depressive symptoms obtained from visual and vocal features of the user. In today's time, vocalizing one's concerns regarding their mental health must be normalized. As humans, it is normal to feel different emotions at once. The application is free and anonymous to make the users feel empowered and safe in seeking treatment. Mental health is all about how an individual thinks, feels and copes up with events in their life.","","978-1-6654-2577-3","10.1109/ICONAT53423.2022.9726090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9726090","ChatBot;RASA;Convolutional Neural Network;Mental Health","Visualization;Sociology;Neural networks;Mental health;Speech recognition;Depression;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;emotion recognition;health care;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical information systems;patient treatment;public domain software;security of data","medical health;mental health;sound mental state;spiritual welfare;human emotion detection;medical intrusion;social welfare;artificial intelligence;AI;stress reduction;anxiety reduction;emergency contacts;emergency services;CNN;RASA;personalizing treatment selection;prognostication;relapse monitoring","","1","","20","IEEE","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional video forensics approaches can detect and localize forgery traces in each video frame using computationally-expensive spatial-temporal analysis, while falling short in real-time verification of live video feeds. The recent work correlates time-series camera and wireless signals to recognize replayed surveillance videos using event-level timing information but it cannot realize fine-grained forgery detection and localization on each frame. To fill this gap, this paper proposes Secure-Pose, a novel cross-modal forgery detection and localization system for live surveillance videos using WiFi signals near the camera spot. We observe that coexisting camera and WiFi signals convey common human semantic information and the presence of forgery attacks on video frames will decouple such information correspondence. Secure-Pose extracts effective human pose features from synchronized multi-modal signals and detects and localizes forgery traces under both inter-frame and intra-frame attacks in each frame. We implement Secure-Pose using a commercial camera and two Intel 5300 NICs and evaluate it in real-world environments. Secure-Pose achieves a high detection accuracy of 95.1% and can effectively localize tampered objects under different forgery attacks.","2641-9874","978-1-6654-0325-2","10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488798","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488798","Surveillance system;video forgery;cross-modal authentication","Location awareness;Wireless communication;Surveillance;Semantics;Streaming media;Cameras;Feature extraction","computer crime;data compression;feature extraction;image forensics;object detection;security of data;video signal processing;video streaming;video surveillance;wireless LAN","cross-modal forgery detection;intra-frame attacks;synchronized multimodal signals;Secure-Pose extracts effective human pose features;common human semantic information;camera spot;WiFi signals;localization system;fine-grained forgery detection;event-level timing information;replayed surveillance videos;time-series camera;real-time verification;video frame;forgery traces;traditional video forensics approaches;surveillance cameras;illegal human activities;authentic live video streams;video forgery attacks;render surveillance systems;live surveillance videos;high detection accuracy","","5","","30","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose an efficient online personal identification system based on Multi-Spectral Palmprint (MSP) images using Contourlet Transform (CT) and Gabor Filter (GF) response. In this study, the spectrum image is characterized by the contourlet coefficients sub-bands. Then, we use the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for modeling the observation vector. In addition, the same spectrum is filtered by the Gabor filter. The real and imaginary responses of the filtering image are used to create another observation vector. Subsequently, the two sub-systems are integrated in order to construct an efficient multi-modal identification system based on matching score level fusion.

Next, we show how to construct a model for vulnerability evaluations, which can represent the behavior of a cloud system in the occurrence of faults or during the execution of operations. The cloud system model consists of state transition models for components of a system with interdependency relationships. In this model, state transitions in a component invoked by the executions of configuration change operations or the occurrences of component faults can trigger state transitions in other components due to the dependency between these components. Using this model, we analyze the propagation of the fault's effect between components having interdependencies.

As a step towards the more practical application scenarios, we introduce a novel task that aims to describe a video using the natural language dialog between two agents as a supplementary information source given incomplete visual data. Different from most existing vision-language tasks where AI systems have full access to images or video clips, which may reveal sensitive information such as recognizable human faces or voices, we intentionally limit the visual input for AI systems and seek a more secure and transparent information medium, i.e., the natural language dialog, to supplement the missing visual information. Specifically, one of the intelligent agents - Q-BOT - is given two semantic segmented frames from the beginning and the end of the video, as well as a finite number of opportunities to ask relevant natural language questions before describing the unseen video. A-BOT, the other agent who has access to the entire video, assists Q-BOT to accomplish the goal by answering the asked questions. We introduce two different experimental settings with either a generative (i.e., agents generate questions and answers freely) or a discriminative (i.e., agents select the questions and answers from candidates) internal dialog generation process. With the proposed unified QA-Cooperative networks, we experimentally demonstrate the knowledge transfer process between the two dialog agents and the effectiveness of using the natural language dialog as a supplement for incomplete implicit visions.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3093360","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NeTS-2109982); Cisco; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9468337","Video description;dialog agents;multi-modal learning","Task analysis;Visualization;Artificial intelligence;Natural languages;Knowledge transfer;Semantics;Video description","computer vision;image segmentation;interactive systems;Internet;natural language interfaces;natural language processing;natural languages;robot vision;video signal processing","video descriptions;dialog agents;complete visual data;intentional vision block;practical application scenarios;natural language dialog;supplementary information source;incomplete visual data;existing vision-language tasks;AI systems;video clips;sensitive information;recognizable human faces;voices;visual input;secure information medium;transparent information medium;missing visual information;intelligent agents;relevant natural language questions;unseen video;internal dialog generation process;incomplete implicit visions","Algorithms;Humans;Semantics","1","","82","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It thus promises broad application prospects in power generation. The whole generation system should operate in both stand-alone mode and grid-connected mode to provide uninterrupted and continuous power to critical loads. The two operating modes have different control structures due to separate control targets, increasing the control complexity of the power generator system. This paper proposes the control winding (CW) current-oriented vector control method for BDFIG in grid-connected mode, which has unique advantages in stand-alone mode. First, the modified variables are obtained under the CW-current rotating frame; Second, the power expression of the system is deduced according to the modified variables; Third, the angle of CW was chosen as a new control degree of freedom based on phase-angle control to realize power control. The proposed control strategy analyzed the control principle of CW-current amplitude and angle control in detail. This method adopts the same orientation strategy with stand-alone mode, which avoids the switching of orientation strategy in different operation modes, thus simplifying the system design a lot. Moreover, considering the same criteria GSC control, reactive power compensation, the control during grid voltage recovery and so on, the large CW-current can be limited at a safety level once the overload or grid faults happened, which can easily achieve Low-Voltage-Ride-Through (LVRT) and significantly increased security and stability of the system. Finally, the proposed control strategy is verified by the experimental results.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2023.3277820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10129920","Brushless doubly fed induction generator;CW-current-oriented;grid-connected operation;phase-angle control;power control","Power control;Windings;Rotors;Control systems;Reactive power;Doubly fed induction generators;Complexity theory","","","","","","","IEEE","19 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this context, planning for future investments in power system requires careful selection and assessment of future operating conditions. This paper revisits the notion of power system adequacy and highlights the need for consideration of some factors that have hitherto tended not to be part of a transmission expansion planning process, in particular in respect of the credible range of possible values of system operating conditions and transitions between successive operating states. Firstly, we present some definitions of power system operational regions. Secondly, we present a stochastic optimisation model that measures the adequacy of a transmission network for given future operating conditions.

However, the issue of attack strength did not get enough attention so that most existing resilient WADCs may fail to defend strong attacks. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multiple-controller switching approach based resilient wide-area damping controller (MCS-RWADC) to suppress inter-area oscillations and mitigate strong attacks. It is inclusive of multiple secure networked prediction control based modules (SNPMs) and a switch-monitor module (MSM). The SNPM can detect attacks, differentiate attack strength and compensate for weak attacks. In terms of strong attacks, multiple SNPMs are implemented to work as backup and three operating states as well as the corresponding switching rules are designed to realize automatic switching among them. MSM is responsible for monitoring the states and directing the switching. Case studies are conducted on a 4-area 5-terminal voltage source converter-based multi-terminal high voltage direct current based offshore wind farm integration system. Simulation results verify MCS-RWADC cannot only suppress the inter-area oscillation but also handle the strong attacks under a wide range of operating conditions with various wind power output.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2022.3215785","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52022035); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9925069","Wide-area damping control;inter-area oscillation;strong attacks;multiple-controller switching;offshore wind","Switches;Damping;Control systems;Phasor measurement units;Oscillators;Cyberattack;Wind power generation","HVDC power transmission;offshore installations;power engineering computing;power generation control;predictive control;security of data;voltage-source convertors;wind power plants","4-area 5-terminal voltage source converter-based multiterminal high voltage direct current based offshore wind farm integration system;attack-resilient controllers;automatic switching;inter-area oscillation;MCS-RWADC;mitigate strong cyber attack;multiple secure networked prediction control;multiple-controller switching approach;operating conditions;resilient WADC;resilient wide-area damping control based modules;SNPM;switch-monitor module;switching rules;wind power output","","","","44","IEEE","19 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In satellite MEC, the raw data of edge users vested in different owners cannot be allowed to be shared, considering data privacy requirements. To address this, federated learning (FL) architecture can be applied to satellite MEC where only parameters and model updates can be transmitted, which avoids the interaction of raw data from diverse sources. In this article, we construct a FL-based satellite MEC architecture, followed by introducing its key techniques in the aspects of resource management and multi-modal data fusion.

The prototype was used to perform collection, selection, and reporting functions on common symmetric block ciphers, where the collection function included running benchmark tests and storing the data in DBMS located on DSOCARE server. The runtime optimal cryptographic algorithm selector (ROCAS), based on a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) method, was used to find Pareto-optimal solutions for a diverse array of client security requests with high and low security, speed, and priority quality of service (QoS) parameters. Finally, the reporting function was used to create the data and figures presented in this paper.

To address this issue, we propose a new method for images-to-video face recognition that pairs face images with multiple attributes (soft labels) and face image quality (FIQ). This is followed by the application of three calibration methods to estimate the likelihood ratio, which is a statistical measure commonly used in forensic investigations. To validate the results, we test our method on the ENFSI proficiency test 2015 dataset, using SCFace and ForenFace as calibration datasets and three embedding models: ArcFace, FaceNet, and QMagFace. Our results indicate that using only high quality frames can improve face recognition performance for forensic purposes compared to using all frames.

The features generated by iris and fingerprint images are fused at the feature level. The generated fused feature vector template cannot be stored directly on the server, if stored directly can lead to various privacy and security concerns. So, these templates are encrypted in such a way that even when applying any operations on the templates, the templates should be in encrypted form. So, the operations need to be performed in the encrypted domain without decrypting it, and the final result, when decrypted should again give back the correct result as if the operations are performed on the original data. Fully Homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme is designed to satisfy the above conditions. FHE is used to compute the hamming distance between the reference and probe template in an encrypted domain. To improve accuracy rotational invariant technique is used, which solves rotational inconsistency problems. The computational speed is increased by using a batching scheme to reduce the number of operations during homomorphic multiplication. We have conducted our experiment on the IITD and CASIA dataset.

A distributed networked system (DIS) that collects raw data from sensors deployed in the field and delivers a composite data to an end-user is faced with two types of uncertainties: at 'information level' due to the multi-modal nature of raw data collected from the environment, and at 'control level' due to the incompleteness in knowledge about the application model. These have a compounded effect on the quality of fault-tolerance exhibited by a DIS. Based on service-layer abstractions, the paper identifies application-oriented metrics to quantify the quality of information flowing through a DIS. Even with imperfect information, the paper demonstrates how the high-level quality metrics and control algorithms enable achieving a reasonable degree of fault-tolerance in a probabilistic manner. A case study of replicated web services is also described.","","978-1-4577-0979-1","10.1109/ARES.2011.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6045941","Probabilistic management;attacker modeling;imprecise knowledge;component replication;web-based information service","Peer to peer computing;Security;Quality of service;Frequency modulation;Fault tolerance;Probabilistic logic;Fault tolerant systems","data integrity;distributed processing;fault tolerant computing","probabilistic fault-tolerance;distributed services;dependable applications;distributed networked system;service-layer abstractions;application-oriented metrics;information quality","","4","","21","IEEE","17 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm was demonstrated on anomalous ICMP network packets (input) and Snort rules (output of the algorithm). Output rules were sorted according to a fitness value and any duplicates were removed. The experimental results on ten test cases demonstrated a 100 percent rule alert rate. Out of 33,804 test packets 3 produced false positives. Each test case produced a minimum of three rule variations that could be used as candidates for a production system.","","978-1-4244-9906-9","10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949394","Intrusion detection;Computational intelligence;Genetic algorithms","Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Humans;Runtime;Syntactics","genetic algorithms;security of data","autonomous rule creation;anomaly based network intrusion detection;multi-modal genetic algorithm;anomalous ICMP network packets;Snort rules","","12","3","16","IEEE","11 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The special feature of these is the designing for operation in two modes: normal and emergency. Digital components can accumulate hidden failures over a long-term normal mode. This reduces their fault tolerance and functional safety of the system in the most responsible emergency mode. Two conditions for occurrence of the hidden fault problem as a growth one are considered in view of a resource approach, which in the development of models, methods and means highlights levels of replication and diversification. Safety-related systems are analyzed as computer systems that have increased to the level of diversification to address the security challenge. Their components are still stamped at a level of resource replication using matrix structures to process data in parallel codes. Fault-tolerant solutions become fault-safe with a sufficient level of circuit checkability, which is commonly known as testability, i.e. structural checkability, depending only on the structure of the circuit. In the operating mode, the checkability becomes structurally-functional, and in critical applications it is converted into a dual-mode, the shortage of which causes the hidden fault problem. A method of analyzing circuits for the possibility of hidden faults is suggested. The method is illustrated on example of an iterative array multiplier implemented in an FPGA project with a LUT-oriented architecture. A program model for the resulting scheme has been developed and potentially dangerous points have been found in it in which the hidden fault problem of may manifest itself.","","978-1-7281-5566-1","10.1109/TCSET49122.2020.235591","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9088661","hidden fault;FPGA;LUT-oriented architecture;safety-related system;digital component;growth problem;resource approach;replication;diversification;matrix structure;checkability;iterative array multiplier;potentially dangerous points","","fault diagnosis;fault tolerance;field programmable gate arrays;integrated circuit reliability;logic design;multiplying circuits;safety;table lookup","hidden fault analysis;FPGA project;safety-related systems;long-term normal mode;fault tolerance;functional safety;responsible emergency mode;hidden fault problem;computer systems;LUT-oriented architecture;iterative array multiplier;matrix structures;circuit checkability","","16","","41","IEEE","7 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the lack of scientific understanding of the basic laws of safety risks, personal accidents are repeatedly happened, leading to vicious electric shock accidents. In addition, if faults cannot be handled quickly and in a timely manner, ground faults can easily cause device overvoltage, causing equipment burnout and even causing fire accidents. Single phase grounding fault and power failure will reduce the reliability of power supply and directly affect industrial production and people's living standards. This article is mainly based on the international advanced safety management concept. By identifying the influencing factors of single-phase grounding in distribution networks and closely integrated with power grid enterprises actual field operations, using the “5M safety risk factor” theory to analyze the personal safety and equipment safety influencing factors in power supply operations, extract six major influence factors that have a greater impact on the distribution network operation and personal safety. Based on the above points, a quantitative assessment model, index, and method system for single-phase fault processing based on security protection are proposed to effectively improve the person and device safety in power grid companies. Pre-control ability has very important practical value and promotion significance.

In visual interactions among humans, facial recognition is one of the most commonly acceptable biometrics. Selection of features is a challenging task as the interaction among the facial features can be complex.

Unlike cookies, fingerprinting is a stateless technique that does not store any information on devices, but instead exploits unique combinations of attributes handed over freely by browsers. The uniqueness of fingerprints allows them to be used for identification. However, browser fingerprints change over time and the effectiveness of tracking users over longer durations has not been properly addressed. In this paper, we show that browser fingerprints tend to change frequently-from every few hours to days-due to, for example, software updates or configuration changes. Yet, despite these frequent changes, we show that browser fingerprints can still be linked, thus enabling long-term tracking. FP-STALKER is an approach to link browser fingerprint evolutions. It compares fingerprints to determine if they originate from the same browser. We created two variants of FP-STALKER, a rule-based variant that is faster, and a hybrid variant that exploits machine learning to boost accuracy. To evaluate FP-STALKER, we conduct an empirical study using 98,598 fingerprints we collected from 1, 905 distinct browser instances. We compare our algorithm with the state of the art and show that, on average, we can track browsers for 54.48 days, and 26 % of browsers can be tracked for more than 100 days.","2375-1207","978-1-5386-4353-2","10.1109/SP.2018.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8418634","Privacy;browser fingerprinting;browsers","Browsers;Microsoft Windows;Portable document format;Security;Privacy;Fingerprint recognition;Target tracking","data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);online front-ends","browser fingerprinting;FP-STALKER approach;browser instances","","28","","26","IEEE","26 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, many of these methods do not consider that social security asks for real-time solutions: active cameras require flexible distributed systems in sensible areas as airports, hospitals, stations, squares and roads. To conjugate both human privacy and real-time supervision, we propose a novel deep architecture, the Multi Streams Network.

By learning over the consumers’ interactive data traffic pattern/behavior, we introduce a new concept of cross-layer power adaption conducted through dynamically adjusting link rate corresponding to content popularity to reduce the wasteful power consumption of Content Routers (CRs). We also develop a controlling policy for each content provider to map its status to the most suitable operating mode to diminish power consumption. Moreover, we propose a smart Selective Caching Scheme (SCS) so that the caching portion in a CR's cache memory is adjusted according to content popularity and available spaces of two customized content cache spaces, namely hot and cold caching queues, for storing popular and unpopular content objects. This scheme can further decrease the power from caching since it is diminished when the traffic load is reduced via the proposed CRs' adaptive mechanism. The evaluation results with practical insights in several distinct scenarios show that the proposal can provide considerably higher energy efficiency and network performance at the same time, typically achieving at least 20% power-saving with a higher hop reduction ratio, compared to existing Internet designs with relevant state-of-the-art caching strategies.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2022.3148146","European Commission's H2020 Program(grant numbers:723172); Fujitsu-Waseda Digital Annealer FWDA Program; National Research Foundation, Korea(grant numbers:BK21 FOUR); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2021R1F1A105089311); Academy of Finland(grant numbers:6Genesis,318927); IDEA-MILL(grant numbers:335936); Dana Impak Perdana(grant numbers:UKM DIP-2018-040); Fundamental Research Grant Scheme(grant numbers:FRGS/1/2018/TK04/UKM/02/7); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9705154","Information-Centric Networking (ICN);Green Networking;Future Internet;network design;Dynamic Power Scaling (DPS)","Internet;Power demand;Telecommunication traffic;Servers;Topology;Security;Real-time systems","cache storage;energy conservation;Internet;power aware computing;power consumption;queueing theory;telecommunication control;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic","hot caching queues;cold caching queues;popular objects;unpopular content objects;energy efficiency;network performance;energy Internet;energy-efficiency issue;network nodes;cross-layer power adaption;content popularity;wasteful power consumption;content routers;content provider;caching portion;customized content cache spaces;smart selective caching scheme;CR cache memory;green ICN design;cross-layer green information-centric networking;Internet designs;CR adaptive mechanism;power consumption;controlling policy","","3","","63","IEEE","4 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Integration of biometric pattern matching into an identity management system (IMS) enhances security of transactions and improves ease of use. Privacy of users in a biometric based system is improved by using keys generated directly from feature sets instead of conventional stored templates. This paper proposes a framework for integrating biometric key based authentication into an IMS. The generated keys need to be consistent. Consistency of keys is attained if the same key is generated for every instance of biometric input. Generation of long and consistent keys directly from feature sets poses a challenge due to intra and inter user variations inherent to biometric data. A novel methodology for generating consistent keys using principles of vector quantization and cluster based learning is introduced. 15-bit keys have been extracted from handwritten signature datasets.

Moreover, this electronic setup was used to interrogate a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR) microbalance, a new sensor class allowing for multi-mode interrogation for gravimetric measurement improvement. The noise source still limiting the system performance is due to the analog-to-digital converter of the microcontroller, thus leaving open degrees-of-freedom for improving the obtained results by optimizing the voltage reference and board layout.

Bio-metric systems and their effects on modern society are discussed in this article. While single-trait bio-metric user identification is widely utilised at the moment, it does not offer sufficient authentication for highly secure applications. To solve these issues, researchers have developed multi-modal bio-metric systems.

This paper aims to develop an efficient system for driving stress detection under real driving circumstances. Multiple physiological signals, i.e., electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and respiration (RESP) were collected and multi-modal features were extracted from time, spectral, and wavelet domains. The proposed approaches are motivated by three points: 1) Obvious individual difference affects the transferability of trained models to a new drive. Then, through dissimilarity evaluation and hierarchical clustering, we searched for subgroups of drives that presented relatively consistent feature distributions. Performing cross-drive modeling within each subgroup enables us to identify driver statuses more precisely with less computation cost; 2) fusing the high-dimensional physiological data from multiple views is beneficial to achieve a reliable assessment but brings new challenges for existing techniques. We adopted Multi-view Intact Space Learning (MISL) to integrate rich information from multiple perspectives by constructing a latent intact representation of the data; 3) most of the existing systems are offline. The current study made both offline and online analysis to validate the effectiveness of this research.

For interpreting the multimodal interactions under attacks, we learn a weakly-supervised sound source visual localization model to localize sounding regions in videos. To mitigate multimodal attacks, we propose an audio-visual defense approach based on an audio-visual dissimilarity constraint and external feature memory banks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that audio-visual models are susceptible to multimodal adversarial attacks; audio-visual integration could decrease the model robustness rather than strengthen under multimodal attacks; even a weakly-supervised sound source visual localization model can be successfully fooled; our defense method can improve the invulnerability of audio-visual networks without significantly sacrificing clean model performance.

To reconfigure between selective and simultaneous activation in a multielement array, each WAND has a dipole resonance mode for MR signal acquisition and two butterfly modes that support counter-rotating current circulation. Because detectors in the same row share the same lower butterfly frequency but different higher butterfly frequency, a pumping signal at the sum frequency of the dipole mode and the higher butterfly mode can selectively activate individual resonators, leading to 4-fold sensitivity gain over passive coupling. Meanwhile, a pumping signal at the sum frequency of the dipole mode and the lower butterfly mode can simultaneously activate multiple resonators in the same row, leading to 3-fold sensitivity gain over passive coupling. When multiple rows of detectors are parallelly aligned, each row has a unique lower butterfly frequency for consecutive activation during the acquisition interval of the others.

IoT devices collect or produce huge multi-modal data that is either processed on the edge or sent to a central cloud for processing. The collected data sets are pre-processed by methods known as “feature selection”, to remove redundant, irrelevant, or noisy features. Feature selection will help with improving the results achieved by the learning method as well as reducing the computational complexity of the model. The goal is to select the most informative features of data and only transmit the selected features to the edge/cloud servers for further processing. This leads to smaller costs for data transmission to the servers. In this paper, a novel wrapper-based federated feature selection (FFS) algorithm is proposed, where IoT devices collaborate to select the most informative features without sharing their local data sets. The proposed FFS algorithm uses binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA) in a federated and collaborative manner to select a small enough subset of informative attributes and provide an improved trade-off between communication cost and learning accuracy. Our experimental results on three data sets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and MAV demonstrate that the proposed BGSAFFS method can in average remove more than 50% of features without losing information. The obtained results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving a good trade-off between accuracy and communication cost in comparison to other state-of-the-art feature selection methods as well as a no-feature selection baseline.","","978-1-6654-5719-4","10.1109/ICNC57223.2023.10074296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074296","Feature selection;Federated Learning;Internet-of-Things;Machine Learning","Learning systems;Costs;Smart cities;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Internet of Things;Servers","cloud computing;computational complexity;computer network security;feature extraction;feature selection;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems;smart cities","binary gravitational search algorithm;central cloud;collaborative manner;collected data sets;data transmission;feature selection algorithm;federated manner;FFS algorithm;huge multimodal data;improved trade-off between communication cost;informative features;IoT devices;IoT environments;learning accuracy;learning method;local data sets;no-feature selection baseline;noisy features;novel wrapper-based;smart city initiative;state-of-the-art feature selection methods;Things applications;wrapper-based federated feature selection","","","","12","IEEE","23 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is based on edge orientation matching (EOM) and subsequent candidate verification using a SNoW (Sparse Network of Winnows) classifier in the final stage. We have developed a simple and efficient EOM method for object modeling and matching using edge orientation information only. To make the system more robust, we verify face candidates obtained by the EOM with a view-based SNoW classifier which operates directly on the grey values. For further speedup, the pipelined matcher is combined with a coarse-to-fine grid scan of the image. On average, it thus requires less than 10% of all possible image locations to be processed by the detection pipeline. With this method, it takes 50 ms on an Athlon 1000-MHz PC to analyze an image of spatial size 384/spl times/288 pixels. Experimental results on a large database of 18,704 grey still images with 19,030 detectable frontal faces, including the M2VTS (Multi-Modal Verification for Teleservices and Security applications) frontal face database, the CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) test set of H.A. Rowley and S. Baluja (1996) and the newly released BioID (Biometric Identification) test set, show that the presented approach outperforms methods that use neural networks, Bayesian methods and support vector machines (SVMs) by far in terms of computational efficiency while showing comparable detection results.

The VOW constructs a dynamic vibration tensor which presents the operating state of air compressors according to the real time vibration data, strengthens the association among the monitoring data in spatial domain and time domain. Thus, dynamic characteristic, which reflects the fault information, can be contained in the dynamic vibration tensor explicitly.

Two enhanced algorithms of Chaotic Neural Network and NeuroEvolution of the augmenting topology have been devised and applied on the fused features. To verify the trustworthiness of the proposed system, several experiments have been deployed on both unimodal and multimodal systems. After several experiments performed, the algorithms reveal that multi biometric system exhibit higher recognition rates and lower false rejection rates compared to unimodal systems. In this research, we have also shown that algorithms have the possibility to countermeasure the loopholes that may occur at the matching module. We have achieved a good recognition rate of 99.1% by adopting score level fusion by using the proposed NeuroEvolution of the augmenting topology algorithm compared to previous research work conducted.

Due to the lack of infrastructure to measure all points of interest, the high measurement cost, and the unavoidable transmission loss, network monitoring systems suffer from the problem that the network traffic data are incomplete with only a subset of paths or time slots measured. Recent studies show that tensor completion can be applied to infer the missing traffic data from partial measurements. Although promising, the interaction model adopted in current tensor completion algorithms can only capture linear and simple correlations in the traffic data, which compromises the recovery performance. To solve the problem, we propose a new tensor completion scheme based on Lightweight Trilinear Pooling, which designs (1) a Trilinear Pooling, a new multi-modal fusion method to model the interaction function to capture the complex correlations, (2) a low-rank decomposition based neural network compression method to reduce the storage and computation complexity, (3) an attention enhanced LSTM to encode and incorporate the temporal patterns in the tensor completion scheme.

In this paper, we propose a feature level fusion of face features which are the physical appearance of a person in image-based and the online handwritten signature features which are the behavioral characteristics of a person in dynamic-based. The problem of high dimensionality of the combined features is overcome by the used of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in the feature extraction phase. One challenge in multi modal feature level fusion is to maintain the balance of the features selected between the two modalities, otherwise one modality may outweigh another. In order to address this issue, we propose to perform feature fusion in the feature selection phase. Feature selection using GA with modified fitness function is applied to the concatenated features in order to ensure that only significant and most balanced features are used for classification.

In a lockable obfuscation scheme there exists an obfuscation algorithm Obf that takes as input a security parameter, a program P, a message msg and lock value lck and outputs an obfuscated program oP. One can evaluate the obfuscated program oP on any input x where the output of evaluation is the message msg if P(x) = lck and otherwise receives a rejecting symbol. We proceed to provide a construction of lockable obfuscation and prove it secure under the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption. Notably, our proof only requires LWE with polynomial hardness and does not require complexity leveraging. We follow this by describing multiple applications of lockable obfuscation. First, we show how to transform any attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme into one in which the attributes used to encrypt the message are hidden from any user that is not authorized to decrypt the message. (Such a system is also know as predicate encryption with one-sided security.) The only previous construction due to Gorbunov, Vaikuntanathan and Wee is based off of a specific ABE scheme of Boneh. By enabling the transformation of any ABE scheme we can inherent different forms and features of the underlying scheme such as: multi-authority, adaptive security from polynomial hardness, regular language policies, etc. We also show applications of lockable obfuscation to separation and uninstantiability results. We first show how to create new separation results in circular encryption that were previously based on indistinguishability obfuscation. This results in new separation results from learning with error including a public key bit encryption scheme that it IND-CPA secure and not circular secure. The tool of lockable obfuscation allows these constructions to be almost immediately realized by translation from previous indistinguishability obfuscation based constructions. In a similar vein we provide random oracle uninstantiability results of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation (and related transformations) from the lockable obfuscation combined with fully homomorphic encryption. Again, we take advantage that previous work used indistinguishability obfuscation that obfuscated programs in a form that could easily be translated to lockable obfuscation.","0272-5428","978-1-5386-3464-6","10.1109/FOCS.2017.62","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8104094","","Encryption;Standards;Electronic mail;Computer science;Complexity theory","computational complexity;public key cryptography","lockable obfuscation scheme;obfuscated programs;indistinguishability obfuscation based constructions;security parameter;lockable obfuscation;learning with errors;polynomial hardness;attribute-based encryption;IND-CPA secure;fully homomorphic encryption","","64","","81","IEEE","13 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a novel approach for fault detection and diagnosis based on Hidden Markov Models. This approach uses pattern recognition combining motor current signature analysis and multiple features extracted from transformations made on current and voltage signals in order to build the representation space. If the representation space is well chosen, each operating mode can be represented as a class. A hidden Markov model is then designed for each class and used as classifier for the detection and diagnosis of faults. The proposed approach is tested on an induction motor of 5.5 Kw with bearing failures and broken rotor bars. Further, the effectiveness of this approach is compared with a neural-network-based approach. The experimental results prove the efficiency of the hidden Markov model-based approach in condition monitoring of electrical machines.","","978-1-4673-0142-8","10.1109/ICElMach.2012.6350108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6350108","fault detection;fault diagnosis;Induction Motor;Hidden Markov Model;squirrel cage motors;pattern recognition;feature extraction;motor-current signal analysis","Hidden Markov models;Induction motors;Bars;Feature extraction;Training;Fault detection;Circuit faults","condition monitoring;fault diagnosis;hidden Markov models;induction motors;pattern recognition","induction motors;HMM;fault detection;fault diagnosis;economic reasons;security reasons;pattern recognition;motor current signature analysis;multiple features;current signals;voltage signals;representation space;bearing failures;broken rotor bars;neural-network-based approach;model-based approach;condition monitoring;electrical machines;power 5.5 kW","","32","","28","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inside AIRBUS Defence & Space, the focus on X-band antennas today is on airborne and fighter nose radars, in satellite based SAR antennas (synthetic aperture radar) for earth observation, and ground surveillance and security radars. Active airborne antennas are assembled with hundreds or even thousands of transmit/receive modules. This paper will describe the evolution of the so-called standardized module solution based on LTCC package technology with special regard to airborne applications and the correlated needs. This evolution especially contains significant optimization steps concerning area, weight and cost. By realization of an SMTR® Module suitable to a folded plank concept a significant reduction of installation depth could be achieved. As the module weight is dominated by its package, technology evaluation and implementation of advantageous concepts and materials was performed, here. Cost reduction is always a key focus of T/R module evolution as the modules still allocate a big part of antenna's production cost. Some steps have been realised here both on technology and component level. The next generation of AESA antennas will result in a combination of different operating modes within the same antenna front end, including radar, communication (data links), and jamming (electronic warfare, EW). This leads to enhanced demands especially towards the MMICs. The RF section of today's T/R modules for AESA applications is typically based on GaAs technology. During the last 10 years there was much progress in the development of disruptive semiconductor materials, especially GaN and SiGe BiCMOS, which have the potential to challenge or even replace the GaAs technology, here. This paper will describe and show this evolution through the last years and shall give an outlook towards future developments with regard to airborne applications.","1097-5764","978-1-4799-4195-7","10.1109/RADAR.2014.7060400","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060400","T/R Module;AESA;X-Band;Airborne","Substrates;Radio frequency;Gallium nitride;Arrays;Radar antennas;Spaceborne radar","airborne radar;beam steering;ceramic packaging;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;integrated circuit packaging;jamming;MMIC;radar antennas;remote sensing by radar","airborne applications;active electronically steered antenna;X-band antenna;airborne radar;fighter nose radar;satellite based SAR antenna;earth observation;ground surveillance;security radar;active airborne antenna;transmit-receive module;standardized module;LTCC package technology;SMTR module;folded plank concept;cost reduction;T/R module;antenna production cost;MMIC;AESA applications;disruptive semiconductor materials;jamming;antenna front end;GaAs","","10","","11","IEEE","16 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Kwon",NA; NA; NA,"Interacting with Computers","18 Jan 2018","2012","24","5","409","422","Haptic and audio cues now appear commonly in computer interfaces, partially due to inherent advantages such as their support for eyes-free interaction. Their invisible, unobservable nature also makes them ideal candidates for security interfaces in which users have to enter secret information such as passwords. In particular, researchers have explored this idea through the design of PIN entry authentication systems based on multi-modal combinations of visual and non-visual content or on the recognition of small sets of unimodal haptic or audio stimuli. This paper highlights the benefits and performance limitations of these approaches and introduces an alternative based on unimodal audio or haptic temporal numerosity – the ability to accurately and rapidly determine the number of cues presented in rapid temporal succession. In essence, in a numerosity interface, rather than recognizing distinct cues, users must count the number of times that a single cue occurs. In an iterative process of design and evaluation, three prototypes implementing this concept are presented and studies of their use reported. The results show the fastest PIN entry times and lowest error rates to be 8 s and 2%, figures that improve substantially on previous research. These results are attained while maintaining low levels of workload and substantial resistance to observation attack (as determined via camera attack security studies). In sum, this paper argues that unimodal audio and haptic numerosity is a valuable and relatively unexplored metaphor for non-visual input and demonstrates the validity of this claim in the demanding task of unobservable authentication systems.","1873-7951","","10.1016/j.intcom.2012.06.005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8147050","Human factors;Haptics and audio;Authentication;Mobile","","","","","13","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Motivated by the ubiquity of commercial cloud platforms, data owners are willing to store their graph databases remotely. However, data privacy has emerged as a widespread concern since the cloud platforms are not fully trusted. One viable solution is to encrypt sensitive data before outsourcing, which inevitably hinders data retrieval. To enable queries over encrypted data, searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) has been introduced. Yet, the most well-studied class of SSE schemes focuses on retrieving textual files given keywords, which cannot be applied to graph databases directly. This paper extends our preliminary work (FC’17) and proposes GraphShield, a structured encryption scheme for graphs. Beyond shortest distance queries, GraphShield can support other classic graph-based queries (e.g., maximum flow) and more complicated analytics (e.g., PageRank). Technically, we incorporate a suite of (efficient) cryptographic primitives and tailor some extra secure protocols for facilitating graph analytics. Our scheme also allows updates on the encrypted graph with forward privacy guaranteed. We formalize the security model and prove the adaptive security with reasonable leakage. Finally, we implement our scheme on various real-world datasets, and the experiment results demonstrate its practicality and scalability.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2020.3024883","NSFC(grant numbers:61822207,U1636219); Outstanding Youth Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2017CFA047); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2042019kf0210); NRF(grant numbers:2016K1A1A2912757); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200757","Searchable encryption;graph encryption;shortest distance query;graph analytics","Encryption;Data privacy;Protocols;Electronic mail;Databases","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;database management systems;graph theory;outsourcing;query processing","GraphShield;secure queries;forward privacy;graph-structured data catalyzes analytics;graph databases;semantic queries;commercial cloud platforms;data owners;data privacy;sensitive data;data retrieval;encrypted data;searchable symmetric encryption;SSE schemes;structured encryption scheme;shortest distance queries;classic graph-based queries;cryptographic primitives;tailor some extra secure protocols;graph analytics;encrypted graph","","11","","53","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Applications such as personal identification, access control, forensics appli-cations, e-banking, e-government, e-health and recently person-alized human-smart-home and human-robot interaction present some examples. In order to offer person-specific services for/of specific person a pre-identifying step should be done in the run-up. Using biometric in such application is encountered by diverse challenges. First, using one trait and excluding the others depends on the application aimed to. Some applications demand directly touch to biometric sensors, while others don't. Second challenge is the reliability of used biometric arrangement. Civilized application demands lower reliability comparing to the forensics ones. And third, for biometric system could only one trait be used (uni-modal systems) or multiple traits (Bi- or Multi-modal systems). The latter is applied, when systems with a relative high reliability are expected. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive view about biometric and its application. The above mentioned challenges will be analyzed deeply. The suitability of each biometric sensor according to the aimed application will be deeply discussed. Detailed com-parison between uni-modal and Multi-modal biometric system will present which system where to be utilized. Privacy and security issues of biometric systems will be discussed too.

Dynamic texture and shape clues are respectively encoded by a two-branch deep CNN model at different rates so that discriminative details are sufficiently captured, and they are combined at intervals for more comprehensive description. Moreover, a 3D model guided data augmentation method is applied to generate a diversity of samples with various poses, which further enhances the anti-spoofing model. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on three public benchmarks, i.e. 3DMAD, HKBU-MARs V1 and SMAD, and the results achieved are state-of-the-art, demonstrating its effectiveness for this issue.","","978-1-7281-3079-8","10.1109/FG47880.2020.00019","Research and Development; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320244","3D face mask anti spoofing;dynamic texture and shape;deep fusion","Three-dimensional displays;Faces;Videos;Feature extraction;Shape;Face recognition;Two dimensional displays","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);face recognition;geometry;image colour analysis;image fusion;image reconstruction;image texture;pose estimation;security of data;shape recognition;stereo image processing;video signal processing","face recognition;shape clues;dynamic texture;multimodal dynamics fusion network;deep fusion;MM-DFN;RGB data;geometry information;depth sensors;RGB image reconstruction;two-branch deep CNN;3DMAD dataset;HKBU-MARs V1 dataset;SMAD dataset;3D face mask antispoofing","","6","","46","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Continuous identification and authentication of users through monitoring social behavior improves detection of identity spoofing. In this paper, we propose a social behaviometric framework to cope with identity spoofing on smartphones. The proposed framework consists of a front-end client module that acquires and provides social networking data to the back-end module which runs online machine learning procedures and provides analytics as a service to the front-end in order to verify user identity through social interactions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework by using real data collected from participants, and inject noisy behavioral patterns to simulate identity spoofing scenarios. Performance results show that under anomalous behavioral patterns, the proposed system can identify genuine users with up to 97% success ratio using an aggregated behavior pattern on five different social network applications.","1938-1883","978-1-4673-8999-0","10.1109/ICC.2017.7997423","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997423","","Social network services;Biometrics (access control);Mobile communication;Measurement;Mobile computing;Smart phones;Authentication","behavioural sciences;data acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;security of data;smart phones;social networking (online)","noisy behavioral patterns;online machine learning procedures;back-end module;social networking data;front-end client module;behaviometric information;social networking applications;multimodal data acquisition;smart mobile devices;social behavior;next generation soft biometrics tools;social network information;built-in sensors;sociability metrics;smartphones;spoofed identities","","4","","20","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, trained artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as Support vector machine (SVM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been proposed to recognize distinct and discriminant features of biometric information (intrinsic hand features and demographic cues) with good classification accuracy. Unfortunately, due to nonlinearity in distinct and discriminant features of biometric information, accuracy of SVM and ANFIS is reduced. As a result, optimized AI algorithms ((ANFIS) with subtractive clustering (ANFIS-SC) and SVM with error correction output code (SVM-ECOC)) have shown to be effective for biometric information recognition. In this paper, we compare the performance of the ANFIS-SC and SVM-ECOC algorithms in their effectiveness at learning essential characteristics of intrinsic hand features and demographic cues based on Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) feature selection. Furthermore, the accuracy of these algorithms are presented, and their recognition performances are evaluated by root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), scatter index (SI), mean absolute deviation (MAD), coefficient of determination  $(R^{2})$ , Akaike’s Information Criterion (AICc) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency index (NSE). Evaluation results show that both SVM-ECOC and ANFIS-SC algorithms are suitable for accurately recognizing soft biometric information on basis of intrinsic hand measurements and demographic cues.

ML, and in particular deep learning, has demonstrated tremendous success in computer vision, natural language understanding, and data analytics. As a result, ML has been proposed as the solution to many problems that inherently include multi-modal data. For example, success in autonomous vehicles has validated the promise of ML with SDF, but additional research is needed to explain, understand, and coordinate heterogeneous data analytics for situation awareness.

Multimedia has become the biggest of big data as the foundation of today's data-driven discoveries. Almost all disciplines of science and engineering, as well as social sciences, involve multimedia data in some forms, such as recording experiments, driverless cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, smart communities, biomedical instruments, security surveillance. Some recent events demonstrate the power of real-time broadcast of unfolding events on social networks. Multimedia data is not just big in volume, but also multi-modal and mostly unstructured. Storing, indexing, searching, integrating, and recognizing from the vast amounts of data create unprecedented challenges. Even though significant progress has been made processing multimedia data, today's solutions are inadequate in handling data from millions of sources simultaneously. The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (IEEE-MIPR) aims to provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation, and applications of multimedia information processing and retrieval for single modality or multiple modalities. The target audiences are university researchers, scientists, industry practitioners, software engineers, and graduate students who want to become acquainted with technologies for big data analytics, machine intelligence, information fusion in multimedia information processing and retrieval. Following a successful debut in Miami, Florida in 2018, the second MIPR, held in San Jose, California, attracted over 140 submissions and more than 100 attendees—a big growth from its inaugural event and an indication of its growing visibility and popularity in the multimedia research society. In addition to four keynote talks, MIPR'19 also featured six innovation multimedia forums organized by both academic and industrial researchers, with topics ranging from computer vision, self-driving, Natural Language Processing, next generation video display, to cutting edge video/audio coding techniques.","1941-0166","","10.1109/MMUL.2019.2916957","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735985","","Streaming media;Multimedia computing;Computer vision;Technological innovation;Big Data;Information retrieval;Data analysis","Big Data;data analysis;information retrieval;multimedia computing","IEEE MIPR;big data analytics;multimedia Big Data;multimedia data processing;multimedia information processing and retrieval;data handling;IEEE International Conference;machine intelligence;information fusion","","3","","0","IEEE","12 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Patel","US Air Force Research Laboratory Rome, NY","2015 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications (CISDA)","20 Aug 2015","2015","","","1","5","As the Internet of Things becomes a reality, proliferation of wireless devices such as ZigBee nodes has accelerated. Their presence is now wide spread in sensitive areas such as home automation, industrial control systems, medical devices and security systems. As their popularity has increased, so has the urgency to protect and defend these networks. The decentralized nature of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for maintaining network security and intrusion detection. RF-fingerprinting provides a unique physical (PHY) layer defense against node counterfeiting by identifying rogue devices through their RF-emissions. In previous work, feature generation from received RF signals was accomplished with parametric variables such as standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, all based on the assumption of a normal distribution of a particular region of interest. We show in this work that most collected signals are either multi-modal or non-parametric. Use of non-parametric methods for feature generation such as mean, median, mode, and trend represented by linear model coefficient estimates are shown to be much more applicable to the non-parametric distribution of the collected ZigBee preamble, resulting in improved classification performance of devices. Non-parametric classifier Random Forest is used with both parametric and non-parametric features to provide a classification performance comparison. Performance improvements of upto 9% in correct classification rates have been achieved and an effective gain of 4 dB SNR was realized.1","2329-6275","978-1-4673-7557-3","10.1109/CISDA.2015.7208645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7208645","","Zigbee;Signal to noise ratio;Authentication;Performance evaluation;Linear regression;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;Internet of Things;Zigbee","nonparametric feature generation;RF-fingerprinting;ZigBee devices;Internet of Things;ZigBee ad-hoc networks;nonparametric classifier random forest","","14","","22","IEEE","20 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the demand for automatically constructing large-scale multiple-choice VQA data grows, we introduce a novel task called textual Distractors Generation for VQA (DG-VQA) focusing on generating challenging yet meaningful distractors given the context image, question, and correct answer. The DG-VQA task aims at generating distractors without ground-truth training samples since such resources are rarely available. To tackle the DG-VQA unsupervisedly, we propose GOBBET, a reinforcement learning(RL) based framework that utilizes pre-trained VQA models as an alternative knowledge base to guide the distractor generation process. In GOBBET, a pre-trained VQA model serves as the environment in RL setting to provide feedback for the input multi-modal query, while a neural distractor generator serves as the agent to take actions accordingly. We propose to use existing VQA models’ performance degradation as indicators of the quality of generated distractors. On the other hand, we show the utility of generated distractors through data augmentation experiments, since robustness is more and more important when AI models apply to unpredictable open-domain scenarios or security-sensitive applications. We further conduct a manual case study on the factors why distractors generated by GOBBET can fool existing models.","2160-7516","978-1-6654-8739-9","10.1109/CVPRW56347.2022.00539","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9856989","","Training;Visualization;Computational modeling;Knowledge based systems;Training data;Reinforcement learning;Data models","learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis;video signal processing","pre-trained VQA model;distractor generation process;GOBBET;neural distractor generator;existing VQA models;generated distractors;textual Distractors Generation;multiple-choice visual question answering;multiple-choice VQA data;challenging yet meaningful distractors;DG-VQA task;ground-truth training samples","","","","50","IEEE","23 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applications of UAVs in urban environments include photography and film-making, security monitoring, real estate, construction, property and infrastructure inspections, leisure, public safety (fires, natural disasters, investigations), traffic, and much more. Emerging UAV applications include last-mile drone delivery services. This paper discusses urban scenarios where drones are more ubiquitous. Monitoring and related safety of these UAVs will be increasingly important. Though multi-modal purpose-built drone tracking and monitoring systems will be the most effective solution for detection and tracking of these RPAS, during the transition to more regular drone use in urban areas and in everyday urban applications, a more rapid-deployment and agile detection system is needed that does not require installation of hardware. In this paper, sensory substitution is presented as an approach to use ambient and pre-existing microphones and AI techniques to detect the presence of RPAS.

Meanwhile, security has become critically important. In the past decade, academia and industry have dedicated great efforts to the design of continuous authentication for multi-modal networks. Multiform authentication bio-tokens have been introduced for continuous entity identification and verification. With the rapid growth and universality of wearable devices, in this article we target continuous authentication for the IoT-based environment with users possessing wearable healthcare (and wellness) related smart objects. To present the state of the art, we provide a comprehensive review of continuous authentication in recent years. Critical characteristics of new biometrics are then introduced. Second, we present a wearable plantar bio-feature extractor constructed via commercial pressure sensors and the Raspberry PI platform. The prototype is adopted to retrieve user plantar bio-data as the raw (and training) data in the proposed authentication system. Third, we apply machinelearning- based techniques to derive a user's plantar bio-features as authentication tokens in the system to support continual (and real-time) entity verification in the background without the user's notice.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8291131","","Authentication;Biometrics (access control);Electrocardiography;Support vector machines;Password;Biomedical monitoring","biometrics (access control);health care;Internet;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);microcomputers;pressure sensors;ubiquitous computing","continuous user authentication;plantar biometrics;comprehensive evolution;information communication technologies;mobile sensing objects;versatile ubiquitous network services;intelligent wearable devices;universal Internet connectivity;smart objects;ubiquitous application development;Internet of Things;multimodal networks;multiform authentication bio-tokens;continuous entity identification;wearable healthcare;wearable plantar bio-feature extractor;user plantar bio-data;authentication system;authentication tokens;machine learning-based techniques;Raspberry PI platform;continuous entity verification;specific-purpose modern sensors","","27","","15","IEEE","13 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Gender information can act as a vital preprocessing ingredient for enhancing speech analysis applications like adaptive human-machine interfaces, multi-modal security applications, and sophisticated intent and context analysis based forensic systems. In uncontrolled environments like telephone speech applications, the gender recognition system should be adaptive, accurate, and robust to noisy environments. This paper presents a reasoning method governed by Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence for automatic gender recognition from telephone speech. The proposed method uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients with a support vector machine to generate the initial prediction results for individual speech segments. The reasoning scheme collects and validates results from support vector machine and treats convincing predictions as valid evidence. It is argued that the consideration of valid evidence in the reasoning process improves recognition performance by avoiding unconvincing classification results. Experiments conducted on large speech datasets reveal the superiority of the proposed gender recognition scheme for speech analysis applications.","","978-1-4673-8685-2","10.1109/PlatCon.2016.7456788","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7456788","","Speech;Support vector machines;Cognition;Feature extraction;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Speech analysis","cepstral analysis;inference mechanisms;speech recognition;support vector machines","Dempster-Shafer fusion;speech analysis applications;evidence theory;automatic gender recognition;telephone speech;Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;support vector machine","","9","","15","IEEE","21 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm starts analysis from HV/MV substations with all loads (MV/LV substations) being disconnected and picks up loads that result in minimal incremental losses. Optimality is always assured by checking on relationships correlating currents and paths, using the concept of dynamic programming and performing configuration changes whenever required. The algorithm relies on the comparison of the incremental losses brought by the addition of each and every load to the network. Quadratic and linear relationships between load currents and paths form the basis of the decisions made for the connections. The algorithm is illustrated with the help of a detailed numerical example. Geographic information systems software, ArcView, was used as the developing tool.","1558-1705","","10.1109/MPER.2002.4312508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4312508","Distribution system;feeder reconfiguration;geographic information system;heuristic algorithm;loss minimization;optimization method","Heuristic algorithms;Geographic Information Systems;Power system planning;Power system relaying;Wavelet analysis;Power system security;Reactive power;Optimal control;Voltage control;PSCAD","","","","","","","IEEE","24 Sep 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The development and deployment of a fully connected transportation system that makes the most of multi-modal, transformational applications requires a robust, underlying technological platform. The platform is a combination of well-defined technologies, interfaces, and processes that, combined, ensure safe, stable, interoperable, reliable system operations that minimize risk and maximize opportunities. The primary application area of connected vehicles is the vehicle safety. These applications are designed to increase situational awareness and reduce or eliminate crashes through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) data transmission that supports: driver advisories, driver warnings, and vehicle and/or infrastructure controls. These technologies may potentially address a great majority of crash scenarios with unimpaired drivers, preventing tens of thousands of automobile crashes every year. Since V2V and V2I communications and a significant data processing are involved, the connected vehicles concept also requires resiliency and immunity for cyber security issues. This panel session will discuss technology, applications, dedicated short range communications (DSRC) technology and capabilities, policy and institutional issues, and international research on the subject matter.","","978-1-4673-6741-7","10.1109/ITEC.2015.7165725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165725","","Accidents;Connected vehicles;Reliability;Systems operation;Vehicle safety","","","","","","","IEEE","27 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
