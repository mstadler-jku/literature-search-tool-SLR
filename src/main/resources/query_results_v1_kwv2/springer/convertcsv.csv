Big data in education have been more prevalent in the cloud environment, and the efficiency of data processing has been greatly enhanced, elevating the significance of big data in education and teaching practice. However, the promotion of education big data in the cloud environment has revealed an increasing number of issues. People pay increasing attention to the security of big data in education, i.e., whether big data in education can be safely maintained, retrieved, and utilized in the cloud environment. It focuses on the relationships between education big data producers, users, and cloud service providers. The primary topics of this article are, therefore, how to govern the connections between the three parties, the adoption of stringent technical means, and the establishment of data use guidelines and a regulatory structure. Consequently, this paper investigated the multimodal information fusion technology and the data security model of education in colleges and universities, as well as constructing a cognitive psychological model for education in colleges and universities based on multimodal information fusion and conducting experimental research on it.

The biometric recognition systems provide suitable personal recognition approaches for determining individuals. Biometrics are broadly employed in several commercial as well as official identification systems for automatic access control. This paper introduces the model for multi-modal biometric recognition based on the feature level fusion method. The overall procedure of the proposed method involves four steps: pre-processing, feature extraction, recognition feature-level fusion, and Bio-metric recognition. The first step is to input the images into pre-processing steps. Thus, pre-processing three traits, like face, finger knuckle, and the hand vein, is done. Then, the feature extraction is done for each modality to extract the features. After that, the feature level fusion is carried out using Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) and the proposed Taylor-Grey Wolf optimization (Tay-GWO). After feature fusion, the Bio-metric recognition is done based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), which Tay-GWO trains. The proposed Tay-GWO is designed by integrating the Taylor series and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). The analysis shows that the developed model achieves the maximal accuracy of 94.86%, maximal sensitivity of 96.80%, and specificity of 93.74%, respectively.",Multi-modal bio-metric system,Taylor series,Grey wolf optimization,Computer Science,Multimedia Information Systems,Computer Communication Networks,Data Structures and Information Theory,2022-11-28,2022-12,Deep convolutional neural network,Cryptography,Special Purpose and Application-Based Systems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By inserting bias into the power system meter measurements, FDIA can cause errors in state estimation and consequently mislead power system operation. Recently, the coordinated state-and-topology FDIA was developed to falsify both the meter measurements and the topology information to conceal a cyber or physical attack. Conventional machine-learning-based detection methods against FDIA depend on the complete observability of power system topology, therefore cannot detect the coordinated state-and-topology FDIA. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal learning model based on Graph Auto-Encoder (GAE) and Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) to detect this type of FDIA. First, GAE is used to learn the compact representation of power system topologies. Then, the obtained topological representation is fused with the measurement to obtain the multi-modal features. Third, ResNet is trained as a multi-label classifier to accept the fused features and generate an array, which can detect attack scenarios and identify the falsified measurements/topologies by coordinated attacks. Comprehensive case studies using IEEE 9-bus, IEEE 57-bus, and IEEE 118-bus systems are presented. The simulation results show that, as compared to single feature methods, the proposed method is more effective in detecting coordinated state-and-topology attacks, and more robust in case of FDIA under unseen topological changes in power system operation.",Power system cyber security,False data injection attack,Topology attack,Engineering,Electrical Engineering,"Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation","Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks",2022-09-09,2022-09,Multi-modal learning,Data-driven methods,,0000-0003-2069-0793,Original Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several conceptual models help with describing the attack process and associated entities, in developing a taxonomy of cyber threats. For Example, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) helps to describe a system to manage cyber security risk. In addition, the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) and the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) are used to standardize indicator information into a form that will make the data sharable. This helps to structure the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) information in order to use it in defensive approaches (e.g., DREAD: damage/reproducibility/exploitability/affected users/discoverability; STRIDE: spoofing/tampering/repudiation/information disclosure/denial of service/elevation of privilege; CVSS: Common Vulnerability Scoring System) along with more advanced approaches that emulate offensive steps. Sharing cyber data is performed by government agencies (e.g., US Department of Homeland Security) along with information analysis centers (e.g., Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center [MS-ISAC]). In addition to managing known threat data across an attack process, threat evaluation is performed via methodological evaluation of system-level vulnerabilities using model/architecture descriptions (e.g., system modeling language [SysML]) and rolling up developing threat descriptions through techniques like the US Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Analytics Repository (DoDCAR).",Risk bow-tie,Confidentiality,integrity,Engineering,"Cyber-physical systems, IoT","Signal, Image and Speech Processing","Communications Engineering, Networks",,,availability (CIA),NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF),,,,,,,978-3-030-88558-8,978-3-030-88559-5,978-3-030-88558-8,,Computer security control (CSC),DoD Cyber Analytics Repository (DoDCAR),Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII),Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS),Australian Signal Directorate Essential 8,Cyber Threat Framework (CTF),Damage/reproducibility/exploitability/affected users/discoverability (DREAD),Spoofing/tampering/repudiation/information disclosure/denial of service/elevation of privilege (STRIDE),Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM),Automated Computer Network Defense (Canada DRDC) (ARMOUR),Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA),Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC),Cyber threat intelligence (CTI),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no infallible solution for protecting against ransomware as the malware code uses metamorphic and polymorphic algorithms to generate different versions thus evading signature detection. Ransomware also uses domain generator algorithms (DGA) to generate new domains for the command and control server (C&C), they constantly exploit new vulnerabilities, and they use various infection vectors. Thus, for an organization to protect itself, an adaptive security architecture is required to constantly monitor the network so as to detect new ransomware infection at an early stage such that it can be blocked before encryption of files occur. This approach is a defence in depth approach which supplements the network defences such as patch management, anti-virus software, intrusion detection, firewalls, and content filtering. A framework for the implementation of the adaptive security architecture model using open source software is presented and the proposed framework is tested against the WannaCry and Petya ransomware.

This is achieved by sharing of resources and service instances among multiple “tenants” of the cloud-hosted application. However, supporting multi-tenancy adds more complexity to SaaS applications required capabilities. Security is one of these key requirements that must be addressed when engineering multi-tenant SaaS applications. The sharing of resources among tenants—i.e. multi-tenancy—increases tenants’ concerns about the security of their cloud-hosted assets. Compounding this, existing traditional security engineering approaches do not fit well with the multi-tenancy application model where tenants and their security requirements often emerge after the applications and services were first developed. The resultant applications do not usually support diverse security capabilities based on different tenants’ needs, some of which may change at run-time i.e. after cloud application deployment. We introduce a novel model-driven security engineering approach for multi-tenant, cloud-hosted SaaS applications. Our approach is based on externalizing security from the underlying SaaS application, allowing both application/service and security to evolve at runtime. Multiple security sets can be enforced on the same application instance based on different tenants’ security requirements. We use abstract models to capture service provider and multiple tenants’ security requirements and then generate security integration and configurations at runtime. We use dependency injection and dynamic weaving via Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to integrate security within critical application/service entities at runtime. We explain our approach, architecture and implementation details, discuss a usage example, and present an evaluation of our approach on a set of open source web applications.",Software-as-a-service,Model-driven engineering,Adaptive-security,Computer Science,Artificial Intelligence,Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems,,2014-03-21,2014-04,Security engineering,Tenant-oriented security,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distinct layers of encryption have been utilized in proposed model for enhancing data security. Transmitter and receiver modules are designed for performing state transition based encrypted activities. Transmitter module is required for capturing environmental turbulences (noise) from a specific geographical location and send encrypted signal to receiver module through wireless network. Receiver module analyses received signal after decryption for desired activities based on real time situations. Different hardware components are selected and compared based on market study targeting efficient construction of proposed modules. Time complexity and code break complexity are measured using different key lengths, keysets, and data sizes for proposed CA based encryption scheme achieving unique results in hardware based cryptography system. Encryption key length, index, and keyset are required for computing code break complexity in design model. Large data size is effectively managed to calculate protection ratio and reliability factor for realizing efficient protectiveness and accuracy. Comparative study between existing encryption technique and proposed CA based encryption technique is established based on time complexity and code break complexity.",Wireless communication,Encryption system,Advanced encryption system (AES),Engineering,"Communications Engineering, Networks","Signal,Image and Speech Processing",Computer Communication Networks,2021-06-16,2021-07,Cellular automata (CA),CA based encryption,,,,,,,,,,,Cryptography,State transition,,,,,,,,,,,,0000-0003-3529-8268,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We know mode switching from domains like aviation and automotive, and we imagine to use this mechanism for the development of resilient systems that continue to function correctly even if under malicious attack. If vulnerabilities are detected or even known, modes can be switched to reduce the attack surface and to minimize attackers’ range of activity. We propose to engineer CPSs with multi-modal software architectures to overcome the interval between the time when zero-day vulnerabilities become known and the time when corresponding updates become available. Thus, affected companies, operators and people will be able to protect themselves and their customers without having to wait for security updates.

Through the random survey on the information assets of multiple departments, this paper proposes the relative deviation distance of security policy configuration as risk measure parameter based on the distance of information-state transition (DIT) theory. By quantitatively analyzing the information asset weight, deviation degree and DIT, we establish the evaluation model for information system. With example analysis, the results prove that this method conducts effective risk evaluation on the information system intuitively and reliably, avoids the threat caused by subjective measurement, and shows performance benefits compared with existing solutions. It is not only theoretically but also practically feasible to realize the scientific analysis of security risk for the information system.",distance of information-state transition (DIT),deviation distance,information asset,Life Sciences,"Life Sciences, general","Materials Science, general","Computer Science, general",,2018-06,risk analysis,TP 309,,,Computer Science,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using security failure data, we identify security threat locations which attackers could use to exploit software vulnerabilities.
