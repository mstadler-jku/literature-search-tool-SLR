Abstract = {Several regional augmentation GNSS systems (like SBAS) are already fully
   operational and other are under development with new frequencies and
   signals on the way. Therefore, it becomes imperative to guarantee for
   all GNSS users the compatibility, interoperability and
   interchangeability between all these systems. The goal is to ensure that
   the user's multi-mode receiver can choose and mix signals from different
   GNSS and SBAS systems to achieve more availability, accuracy and
   robustness. Attaining that objective will require agreements on
   frequency plans and signal designs, as well as other details including
   means to ensure interoperability of system times and geodetic reference
   systems.
   This paper suggests a Universal-SBAS (U-SBAS) standard, compatible with
   all the existing and planned regional GNSS systems (and their
   evolutions) in the world, like IRNSS, QZSS, PCW, BEIDOU-1, WAAS, EGNOS,
   SDCM, GAGAN, MSAS. The proposed worldwide multimodal U-SBAS standard
   carries additional channels (signals and messages) to cover the
   non-aeronautical specific Safety-of-Life (SoL) services, and also High
   Precision Positioning Services (HPPS), Position Velocity Time (PVT),
   authentication services, safety services, scientific application
   services, High Precision Timing Services (HPTS), etc. U-SBAS is designed
   to be fully interoperable with the current SBAS standards and to allow
   significant performance and service improvements in operational,
   scientific and/or security areas. Finally usage examples of the proposed
   standard are given for different types of applications such as science,
   aviation, precise point positioning, timing, security, robust
   positioning, maritime and reflectometry.},

Abstract = {Biometric user authentication techniques for security and access control
   have evoked an enormous interest by science, industry and society in the
   last two decades. Scientist and researchers have constantly pursued the
   technology for automated confirmation of the identity of subjects based
   on measurements of physiological or behavioral traits of humans. But
   even the best single biometric system suffers from spoof attacks,
   intra-class variability, noise, susceptibility etc. To address this
   issue, we develop a hybrid multibiometric system which integrates
   multi-algorithm and multi-modal approaches of multibiometric system and
   use bi-level fusion to combine biometric information. We use face, ear
   and signature biometric traits which are first classified by three
   classification techniques-multilayer perceptron, Fisherimage and
   Bayesian network. The outcomes of these classifiers for face are fused
   by rank fusion method. Outcomes for ear and signature are also fused
   similarly. The second level fusion occurs when we combine the results of
   these three rank fusion methods' outcomes for face, ear and signature
   with decision fusion method. We use Borda count and Borda fuse
   approaches for rank fusion and majority voting, weighted majority voting
   and behavioral knowledge space approaches for decision fusion. The final
   results indicate that this hybrid multi biometric system outperforms the
   single biometric systems build on the same data using the same
   classification algorithms. This system can be effectively used in law
   enforcement or homeland security department or for commercial purposes.},

Abstract = {In order to tolerate possible leakage of secret keys, leakage-resilient
   cryptosystem models a class of attractive leakage output by allowing an
   adversary to provide any computable leakage function and learning the
   partial keys or other possible internal states from the output of
   function. In this work, we present an adaptively secure broadcast
   encryption resilient to key continual leakage in the standard model. Our
   scheme provides the tolerance of continual leakage, in which any user
   can generate multiple private keys per user by periodically updating the
   key. We use the dual system encryption mechanism to implement the
   leakage resilience and adaptive security, and intrinsically set an
   algorithm to refresh a key and produce a same distributed new key. We
   also give the evaluation of the leakage bound and leakage fraction, and
   the simulations show that our scheme can tolerate about 71\% leakage
   fraction with 3.34 x 10(-52) failure probability in standard 80-bit
   security level when we adjust the leakage factor to allow the private
   key to be 100 Kb.},

Title = {A Novel QoS-Oriented Intrusion Detection Mechanism for IoT Applications},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {JUN 18},
Abstract = {Wireless sensor network (WSN) is an integral part of Internet of Things
   (IoT). The sensor nodes in WSN generate large sensing data which is
   disseminated to intelligent servers using multiple wireless networks.
   This large data is prone to attacks from malicious nodes which become
   part of the network, and it is difficult to find these adversaries. The
   work in this paper presents a mechanism to detect adversaries for the
   IEEE 802.15.4 standard which is a central medium access protocol used in
   WSN-based IoT applications. The collisions and exhaustion attacks are
   detected based on a soft decision-based algorithm. In case the QoS of
   the network is compromised due to large data traffic, the proposed
   protocol adaptively varies the duty cycle of the IEEE 802.15.4.
   Simulation results show that the proposed intrusion detection and
   adaptive duty cycle algorithm improves the energy efficiency of a WSN
   with a reduced network delay.},

Title = {Sejong face database: A multi-modal disguise face database},
Journal = {COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {208},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Commercial application of facial recognition demands robustness to a
   variety of challenges such as illumination, occlusion, spoofing,
   disguise, etc. Disguised face recognition is one of the emerging issues
   for access control systems, such as security checkpoints at the borders.
   However, the lack of availability of face databases with a variety of
   disguise add-ons limits the development of academic research in the
   area. In this paper, we present a multi-modal disguised face dataset to
   facilitate the disguised face recognition research. The presented
   database contains 8 facial add-ons and 7 additional combinations of
   these add-ons to create a variety of disguised face images. Each facial
   image is captured in visible, visible plus infrared, infrared, and
   thermal spectra. Specifically, the database contains 100 subjects
   divided into Subset-A (30 subjects, 1 image per modality) and Subset-B
   (70 subjects, 5 plus images per modality). We also present baseline face
   detection results performed on the proposed database to provide
   reference results and compare the performance in different modalities.
   Qualitative and quantitative analysis is performed to evaluate the
   challenging nature of disguise add-ons. The dataset will be publicly
   available with the acceptance of the research article.},

Abstract = {In functional encryption (FE) schemes, ciphertexts and private keys are
   associated with attributes and decryption is possible whenever key and
   ciphertext attributes are suitably related. It is known that expressive
   realizations can be obtained from a simple FE flavor called inner
   product encryption (IPE), where decryption is allowed whenever
   ciphertext and key attributes form orthogonal vectors. In this paper, we
   construct (non-anonymous) IPE systems with constant-size ciphertexts for
   the zero and non-zero evaluations of inner products. These schemes
   respectively imply an adaptively secure identity-based broadcast
   encryption scheme and an identity-based revocation mechanism that both
   feature short ciphertexts and rely on simple assumptions in prime order
   groups. We also introduce the notion of negated spatial encryption,
   which subsumes non-zero-mode IPE and can be seen as the revocation
   analogue of the spatial encryption primitive of Boneh and Hamburg.},

Abstract = {Detecting chemical species in gas phase has recently received an
   increasing interest mainly for security control, trying to implement new
   systems allowing for extended dynamics and reactivity. In this work, an
   open-loop interrogation strategy is proposed to use radio-frequency
   acoustic transducers as micro-balances for that purpose. The resulting
   system is dedicated to the monitoring of chemical compounds in gaseous
   or liquid-phase state. A 16 Hz standard deviation is demonstrated at 125
   MHz, with a working frequency band in the 60 to 133 MHz range, answering
   the requirements for using Rayleigh-and Love-wave-based delay lines
   operating with 40-mu m acoustic wavelength transducers. Moreover, this
   electronic setup was used to interrogate a high-overtone bulk acoustic
   wave resonator (HBAR) microbalance, a new sensor class allowing for
   multi-mode interrogation for gravimetric measurement improvement. The
   noise source still limiting the system performance is due to the
   analog-to-digital converter of the microcontroller, thus leaving open
   degrees-of-freedom for improving the obtained results by optimizing the
   voltage reference and board layout. The operation of the system is
   illustrated using a calibrated galvanic deposition at the surface of
   Love-wave delay lines to assess theoretical predictions of their
   gravimetric sensitivity and to compare them with HBAR-based sensor
   sensitivity.},

Abstract = {FUZZBUSTER is a host-based adaptive security system that automatically
   discovers, refines, and repairs vulnerabilities in hosted applications
   in order to prevent cyberattacks. FUZZBUSTER must decide when to adapt
   its applications, when to revoke its previous adaptations, and when to
   sacrifice functionality to improve security. This requires an adaptation
   quality metric that captures (1) an application's susceptibility to
   cyberattacks and (2) an application's functionality, since adapting an
   application affects both of these factors. FUZZBUSTER uses different
   types of test cases to measure security and functionality. In this
   paper, we describe FUZZBUSTER's adaptation metrics and we present two
   different policies for balancing security and functionality. We provide
   empirical results comparing these policies, and we also demonstrate how
   FUZZBUSTER can temporarily sacrifice the functionality of hosted
   applications to increase host security, and then restore functionality
   when more favorable adaptations are found.},

Title = {A Refined Supervision Model of Rice Supply Chain Based on
   Multi-Blockchain},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {With the development of Agriculture 4.0, the requirements for
   sustainable agriculture and precision agriculture continue to grow. As
   one of the three major staple foods globally, the quality and safety of
   rice affect human health as well as social development. To ensure the
   quality and safety of rice and reduce the flow of problematic rice, a
   multi-layer blockchain-based rice supply chain refinement supervision
   model MBRRSM (Multi-blockchain Rice Refined Supervision Model) is
   proposed from the information level. First, the characteristics of
   information flow in the rice supply chain are analyzed, and a
   classification table of key information is constructed. Second, the
   MBRRSM framework is designed. Based on a multi-party hybrid encryption
   algorithm, secure multi-party computing algorithm, multi-mode storage
   mechanism, and SPOP (Supervision Proof of Peers) consensus algorithm, a
   set of mechanisms is designed for the transmission, use, storage, and
   consensus of rice data in MBRRSM. Subsequently, the security and
   performance capabilities of MBRRSM are analyzed. Meanwhile, the SPOP
   consensus algorithm is analyzed. Finally, a prototype system is built
   based on MBRRSM and verified through exemplary scenarios in different
   usage situations. The results show that research on the refined
   supervision of the rice supply chain based on multi-blockchain can
   finely supervise all types of data in the rice supply chain, and provide
   a guarantee for enterprise users to safely transmit and use data with
   different privacy levels. This study presents a unique research paradigm
   that introduces the theories and methods of the new information field
   generation into the field of agricultural research, and thus assists in
   the strategy implementation of ``holding grain in the land and storing
   grain in technology{''}.},

Title = {Counting clicks and beeps: Exploring numerosity based haptic and audio

Abstract = {Haptic and audio cues now appear commonly in computer interfaces,
   partially due to inherent advantages such as their support for eyes-free
   interaction. Their invisible, unobservable nature also makes them ideal
   candidates for security interfaces in which users have to enter secret
   information such as passwords. In particular, researchers have explored
   this idea through the design of PIN entry authentication systems based
   on multi-modal combinations of visual and non-visual content or on the
   recognition of small sets of unimodal haptic or audio stimuli. This
   paper highlights the benefits and performance limitations of these
   approaches and introduces an alternative based on unimodal audio or
   haptic temporal numerosity - the ability to accurately and rapidly
   determine the number of cues presented in rapid temporal succession. In
   essence, in a numerosity interface, rather than recognizing distinct
   cues, users must count the number of times that a single cue occurs. In
   an iterative process of design and evaluation, three prototypes
   implementing this concept are presented and studies of their use
   reported. The results show the fastest PIN entry times and lowest error
   rates to be 8 s and 2\%, figures that improve substantially on previous
   research. These results are attained while maintaining low levels of
   workload and substantial resistance to observation attack (as determined
   via camera attack security studies). In sum, this paper argues that
   unimodal audio and haptic numerosity is a valuable and relatively
   unexplored metaphor for non-visual input and demonstrates the validity
   of this claim in the demanding task of unobservable authentication
   systems. (C) 2012 British Informatics Society Limited. All rights

Abstract = {Afterglow including thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and
   room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has stimulated considerable
   attention owing to bright potential applications in optoelectronic
   devices, sensing, and security systems. However, previously reported
   afterglow materials are mostly single-mode (one of RTP or TADF only), a
   tunable multi-mode afterglow emission is still rarely achieved. Herein,
   we report the temperature-responsive conversion characteristics of TADF
   and RTP of carbon dots in silica (CDs@SiO2) for the first time. The
   unique temperature-responsive afterglow characteristics, that is,
   phosphorescence and TADF can be mutually transformed as the temperature
   changes, resulting in the free conversion of the RTP/TADF ratio as well
   as the afterglow color change through simple temperature control. The
   Si-O network plays multiple roles to strengthen and confine the embedded
   CDs, thus resulting in ultralong RTP emission and unique afterglow
   characteristics. Furthermore, CDs@SiO2 exhibited excellent stability
   against water, acid, alkali, salt and oxidants as well as polar
   solvents. CDs@SiO2 with unique afterglow characteristics and high
   stability can have multiple potential applications in rapid fingerprint
   detection and temperature sensing, especially in advanced
   temperature-responsive multicolor anti-counterfeiting and encryption.},

Abstract = {Searchable Encryption (SE) is a popular cryptographic primitive for
   building ciphertexts retrieval systems with far-reaching applications.
   However, existing SE schemes generally do not support threshold access
   control (i.e., data users must collaboratively issue search and
   decryption operations over encrypted cloud data) in a group-oriented
   cloud data sharing setting, which is increasingly receiving much
   attention in the research community. Thus, in this article, we first
   propose a Threshold Multi-keyword Search (TMS) scheme for cloud-based
   group data sharing (referred to as basic TMS scheme) by utilizing
   Shamir's secret sharing technique, to achieve threshold multi-keyword
   search, threshold decryption, and short record ciphertext size. Then, we
   extend this basic TMS to realize threshold result verification and
   threshold traceability (referred to as enhanced TMS). Furthermore, the
   enhanced TMS is extended to support public result verification and
   dynamic operations with the public verifier and improved hash tables,
   respectively. Our formal security analysis proves that both basic TMS
   and enhanced TMS are semi-adaptively secure and can resist
   Chosen-Keyword Attack (CKA). Our theoretical evaluation and empirical
   experiments demonstrate the potential utility of both schemes.},

Abstract = {Cybersecurity attacks, which have many business impacts, continuously
   become more intelligent and complex. These attacks take the form of a
   combination of various attack elements. APT attacks reflect this
   characteristic well. To defend against APT attacks, organizations should
   sufficiently understand these attacks based on the attack elements and
   their relations and actively defend against these attacks in multiple
   dimensions. Most organizations perform risk management to manage their
   information security. Generally, they use the information system risk
   assessment (ISRA). However, the method has difficulties supporting
   sufficiently analyzing security risks and actively responding to these
   attacks due to the limitations of asset-driven qualitative evaluation
   activities. In this paper, we propose a threat-driven risk assessment
   method. This method can evaluate how dangerous APT attacks are for an
   organization, analyze security risks from multiple perspectives, and
   support establishing an adaptive security strategy.},

   Biometric systems are broadly categories into two types: Uni-modal and
   Multi-modal. By comparing both these systems, it is clear that
   multi-modal biometric systems are gathering more popularity as it has
   the capability of dealing challenges involved in uni-modal biometric
   systems such as: non-universality, captured data noise, variations
   between same class, spoof attacks and unacceptable error rates. This
   paper will discuss various levels of information fusion, fusion

Abstract = {The safety of the Industrial Internet Control Systems has been a hotspot
   in the information security. To meet the needs of communication, a large
   variety of proprietary protocols have emerged in the field of industrial
   control. The protocol field is often trusted in the implementation of
   industrial control terminal code. If attackers modify the data of these
   fields using the protocol defect, the operation of the program can be
   controlled and the entire system will be affected. To cope with such
   security threats, academia and industry generally adopt fuzz test
   methods. However, the current industrial control protocol fuzz test
   methods generally have low code coverage, where unified description
   models are missing and test cases are not targeted. A method of
   fuzzification processing combined with dynamic multi-modal sensor
   communication data is proposed. To track the program execution, the
   dynamic pollution analysis is used to search for the input fields that
   affect the execution of the conditional branch and capture the
   dependencies between the conditional branches to guide the grammar
   generation of test cases, which can increase the chances of executing
   deep code. The experimental results show that the proposed method
   improves the validity and code coverage of test cases to a certain
   extent and greatly increases the probability of anomaly detection in the
   protocol implementation.},

Abstract = {Biometric security depends on its accuracy and efficiency, but is
   especially vulnerable to spoof attacks. Currently liveness detection has
   become the standard method of reducing the impact of spoof attacks,
   however whilst this protects against spoof creation and presentation, it
   does nothing to detect legitimate users being coerced into accessing
   systems. This paper looks at this coercion concept, indicating the
   impact coercion could have on biometric security and how it can be
   detected. This paper will identify scenarios in which coercion detection
   could improve security as well as identifying the underlying concepts
   that make this area up, culminating in the presentation of four high
   level techniques which can be implemented within a multi-modal biometric
   system to detect coercion detection.},

Abstract = {We provide efficient constructions for trace-and-revoke systems with
   public traceability in the black-box confirmation model.
   Our constructions achieve adaptive security, are based on standard
   assumptions and achieve significant efficiency gains compared to
   previous constructions. Our constructions rely on a generic
   transformation from inner product functional encryption (IPFE) schemes
   to trace-and-revoke systems. Our transformation requires the underlying
   IPFE scheme to only satisfy a very weak notion of security - the
   attacker may only request a bounded number of random keys - in contrast
   to the standard notion of security where she may request an unbounded
   number of arbitrarily chosen keys. We exploit the much weaker security
   model to provide a new construction for bounded collusion and random key
   IPFE from the learning with errors assumption (LWE), which enjoys
   improved efficiency compared to the scheme of Agrawal et al.
   {[}CRYPTO'16].
   Together with IPFE schemes from Agrawal et al., we obtain trace and
   revoke from LWE, Decision Diffie Hellman and Decision Composite
   Residuosity.},

Abstract = {We propose a key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) scheme with
   constant-size ciphertexts, whose almost tightly semi-adaptive security
   is proven under the decisional linear (DLIN) assumption in the standard
   model. The access structure is expressive, that is given by non-monotone
   span programs. It also has fast decryption, i.e., a decryption includes
   only a constant number of pairing operations. As an application of our
   KP-ABE construction, we also propose an efficient, fully secure
   attribute-based signatures with constant-size secret (signing) keys from
   the DLIN. For achieving the above results, we extend the sparse matrix
   technique on dual pairing vector spaces. In particular, several
   algebraic properties of an elaborately chosen sparse matrix group are
   applied to the dual system security proofs.},

Abstract = {Fuzzy techniques can implement the fine-grained access control of
   encrypted data in the Cloud because they support error-tolerance. In
   this system, using biometric attributes such as fingerprints, faces and
   irises as pubic parameters is advantageous over those systems based on
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This is because biometric information
   is unique, unforgettable and non-transferable. However the
   biometric-attribute measurements are noisy and most of the existing
   encryption systems can not support the biometric-attribute encryption.
   Additionally, the previous fuzzy encryption schemes only achieve the
   selective security which is a weak security model. To overcome these
   drawbacks, we propose a new fuzzy encryption scheme based on the lattice
   in this letter. The proposed scheme is based on a hierarchical
   identity-based encryption with fixed-dimensional private keys space and
   thus has short public parameters and short private keys, which results
   in high computation efficiency. Furthermore, it achieves the strong
   security, i.e., adaptive security. Lastly, the security is reduced to
   the learning with errors (LWE) problem in the standard model.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a two-stage combined central and distributed
   Volt/Var control (VVC) strategy to coordinate both utility-scale and
   customer-owned photovoltaics (PVs) for voltage regulation in active
   distribution networks (ADN). In the first stage, with day-ahead PV and
   load predictions, the central controller (CC) performs optimal power
   flow (OPF) to determine the hourly dispatch of on-load tap changers
   (OLTC) and capacitor banks (CBs). In the second stage, the ADN is
   partitioned into different zones only based on PV and load types. The
   zone controllers (ZC), which is formulated by deep neural networks
   (DNN), then communicate with their neighbors and track the optimal total
   reactive power support of PVs in each zone. In the offline training
   process, an analytical derivation to minimize power losses is also
   provided that can help the input and output selection of DNN. To online
   dispatch reactive power for individual utility-scale and customer-owned
   PVs in corresponding zones, a multi-mode reactive power allocation
   strategy is proposed. Three different modes namely loss reduction mode
   (LRM), fair power sharing mode (FPM) and voltage security mode (VSM) are
   designed to meet varying operation requirements, which can mitigate
   voltage violations with fair participation for customers and reduced
   power losses for system operators. Numerical simulations are performed
   on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system to demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed method in finding a trade-off between voltage security
   and loss minimization with fairness.},

Abstract = {On-demand ride and ride-sharing services have revolutionized the
   point-to-point transportation market and they are rapidly gaining
   acceptance among customers worldwide. Alone, Uber and Lyft are providing
   over 11 million rides per day (DMR, 2018a,b). These services are
   provided using a client-server infrastructure. The client is a
   smartphone-based application used for: (i) registering riders and
   drivers, (ii) connecting drivers with riders, (iii) car-sharing to share
   the expenses, minimize traffic congestion and saving traveling time,
   (iv) allowing customers to book their rides. The server typically, run
   by multi-national companies such as Uber, Ola, Lyft, BlaBlaCar, manages
   drivers and customers registrations, allocates ride-assignments, sets
   tariffs, guarantees payments, ensures safety and security of riders,
   etc. However, the reliability of drivers have emerged as a critical
   problem, and as a consequence, issues related to riders safety and
   security have started surfacing. The lack of robust driver verification
   mechanisms has opened a room to an increasing number of misconducts
   (i.e., drivers subcontracting ride-assignments to an unauthorized
   person, registered drivers sharing their registration with other people
   whose eligibility to drive is not justified, etc.) (Horwitz, 2015;
   USAtoday, 2016).
   This paper proposes DRIVERAUTH - a novel risk-based multi-modal
   biometric-based authentication solution, to make the on-demand ride and
   ride-sharing services safer and more secure for riders. DRIVERAUTH
   utilizes three biometric modalities, i.e., swipe, text-independent
   voice, and face, in a multi-modal fashion to verify the identity of
   registered drivers. We evaluated DRIVERAUTH on a dataset of 10,320
   samples collected from 86 users and achieved a True Acceptance Rate
   (TAR) of 96.48\% at False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.02\% using Ensemble
   Bagged Tree (EBT) classifier. Furthermore, the architecture used to
   design DRIVERAUTH enables easy integration with most of the existing
   on-demand ride and ride-sharing systems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for user awareness and acceptance of
   smart card and fingerprint-based access control to medical information
   systems in South Africa. The study was conducted at Charlotte Maxeke
   Academic Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa, and followed a
   qualitative and interpretive research design to collect data for the
   ideal deployment of multi-modal access control systems in the hospital.
   Surveys were distributed to workers in the hospital who require access
   to patient records - such as clinicians and administrators. The survey
   resulted in an 86\% response rate. The results revealed key problem
   areas which related to a lack of user awareness and acceptance. One of
   the key problems was that 79\% of respondents indicated they have never
   had any security awareness sessions or training. Insights from the
   survey were used to create a framework. The framework extends the
   Unified Theory of Acceptance of User Technology (UTAUT) model, to
   address awareness and acceptance problems. The focus was on how user
   attitudes, beliefs and personal knowledge influence acceptance and usage
   of access-control technology. Recommendations made to the hospital
   included that mandatory awareness training programmes be conducted
   regularly to increase user acceptance of smart card and
   fingerprint-based access control.},

Abstract = {``Having Divided to Conquer We Must Reunite {[}to] Rule{''} {[}3].
   Decomposition of problems and systems into smaller, more manageable
   units has been at the heart of software engineering practice for
   decades. ``Separation of concerns{''} gives software engineers the
   conceptual and practical tools to focus their attention, and their
   tools, on the parts of the problem or solution to which they are best
   suited. Perhaps one of the earliest boundaries used to separate concerns
   is that which exists between hardware and software - once that boundary
   is drawn, software engineers were able to focus their attention on the
   development of software within the hardware boundaries chosen. There has
   however, been a steady erosion of such boundaries: digital and physical
   connectivity have become the norm, and increasingly such connectivity
   can be ad hoc, spontaneous, and often unplanned (perhaps best
   exemplified by the Internet of Things paradigm). Moreover, the fluid and
   disappearing boundaries between technology and people have radically
   affected social behaviours (again, perhaps well exemplified by the
   proliferation of mobile and ubiquitous computing such as wearable and
   `smart' technologies used in variety of personal and community
   settings). Such convergence between digital, physical, and social spaces
   has provided exciting opportunities for software engineers to,
   literally, `cross boundaries', and, as a result, to have an impact on
   the physical and social worlds in which the software they build will
   operate. But in this brave new world with porous boundaries, security
   engineering and privacy management challenges abound. Effective security
   depends on the ability to control access to assets protected by
   boundaries {[}2]. Effective privacy management depends on informed,
   consensual sharing of information across boundaries {[}4]. Our thesis is
   that, although increasingly invisible, and rightly so, explicit
   awareness and sometimes representation of boundaries in
   cyber-physical-social systems facilitate good old fashioned separation
   of concerns, which in turn enables more effective software engineering
   of secure, privacy-aware software {[}5, 6]. We support our thesis with
   examples from our research in adaptive security {[}7] and privacy {[}1].},

Abstract = {omposable security definitions, at times called simulation-based
   definitions, provide strong security guarantees that hold in any
   context. However, they are also met with some skepticism due to many
   impossibility results; goals such as commitments and zero-knowledge that
   are achievable in a stand-alone sense were shown to be unachievable
   composably (without a setup) since provably no efficient simulator
   exists. In particular, in the context of adaptive security, the
   so-called ``simulator commitment problem{''} arises: once a party gets
   corrupted, an efficient simulator is unable to be consistent with its
   pre-corruption outputs. A natural question is whether such impossibility
   results are unavoidable or only artifacts of frameworks being too
   restrictive.
   In this work, we propose a novel type of composable security statement
   that evades the commitment problem. Our new type is able to express the
   composable guarantees of schemes that previously did not have a clear
   composable understanding. To this end, we leverage the concept of system
   specifications in the Constructive Cryptography framework, capturing the
   conjunction of several interval-wise guarantees, each specifying the
   guarantees between two events. We develop the required theory and
   present the corresponding new composition theorem.
   We present three applications of our theory. First, we show in the
   context of symmetric encryption with adaptive corruption how our notion
   naturally captures the expected confidentiality guarantee-the messages
   remain confidential until either party gets corrupted-and that it can be
   achieved by any standard semantically secure scheme (negating the need
   for non-committing encryption). Second, we present a composable
   formalization of (so far only known to be standalone secure) commitment
   protocols, which is instantiable without a trusted setup like a CRS. We
   show it to be sufficient for being used in coin tossing over the
   telephone, one of the early intuitive applications of commitments.
   Third, we reexamine a result by Hofheinz, Matt, and Maurer
   {[}Asiacrypt'15] implying that IND-ID-CPA security is not the right
   notion for identity-based encryption, unmasking this claim as an
   unnecessary framework artifact.},

Abstract = {User authentication is fundamental to the protection of information
   systems. It is the first and most critical link in the security chain
   that restricts access to system and data resources to legitimate users
   only. The advantages of using biometrics to verify a person's identity
   over using passwords or tokens have been broadly presented. However,
   recent research has revealed that biometric technologies can be defeated
   with low-tech and cheap materials. This presents a new challenge at a
   time when people are encouraged to use biometrics as a means to enhance
   network security. Since biometrics are not secrets, there exists a risk
   of them being captured, copied, and forged. In this paper, the biometric
   authentication's vulnerability to various attacks is analyzed, and
   efforts to defeat the spoofing attacks are presented. In particular,
   multi-modal biometric fusion approaches are presented to counteract
   security threats.},

Abstract = {Many aspects of cryptographic security proofs can be seen as the proof
   that a certain system (e.g. a block cipher) is indistinguishable from an
   ideal system (e.g. a random permutation), for different types of
   distinguishers.
   This paper presents a new generic approach to proving upper bounds on
   the information-theoretic distinguishing advantage (from an ideal
   system) for a combined system, assuming upper bounds of certain types
   for the component systems. For a general type of combination operation
   of systems, including the XOR of functions or the cascade of
   permutations, we prove two amplification theorems. The first is a,
   product theorem, in the spirit of XOR-lemmas: The distinguishing
   advantage of the combination of two systems is at most twice the product
   of the individual distinguishing advantages. This bound is optimal. The
   second theorem states that the combination of systems is secure against
   some strong class of distinguishers, assuming only that the components
   are secure against some weaker class of distinguishers.
   A key technical tool of the paper is the proof of a tight two-way
   correspondence, previously only known to hold in one direction, between
   the distinguishing advantage of two systems and the probability of
   winning an appropriately defined game.},

Abstract = {Attacks on the networks are most important issues. Therefore, the
   prevention of such attacks is imperative. The hindrance of such attacks
   is exclusively dependent on their detection. The detection is a prime
   part of any security tool such as Intrusion Detection System (IDS),
   Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Adaptive Security Alliance (ASA),
   check points and firewalls. A variety of intrusion detection approaches
   be present to resolve this severe issue but the main problem is
   performance. Therefore, in this paper, a model is proposed to overcome
   performance issues. In this model, support vector machine (SVM) and
   backpropagation neural network are applied on distributed denial of
   service (DDOS) attacks. The system uses sampled data form cooperative
   association for internet data analysis (CAIDA) dataset, an attack
   database that is a standard for evaluating the security detection
   mechanisms. The results and comparative studies indicate that the
   proposed mechanism demonstrate more accuracy in case of false positive,
   false negative and detection rate.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing is now a widespread and economical option when data
   owners need to outsource or share their data. Designing secure and
   efficient data access control mechanism is one of the most challenging
   issues in cloud storage service. Anonymous broadcast encryption is a
   promising solution for its advantages in the respects of computation
   cost and communication overload. We bring forward an efficient anonymous
   identity-based broadcast encryption construction combined its
   application to the data access control mechanism in cloud storage
   service. The lengths for public parameters, user private key and
   ciphertext in the proposed scheme are all constant. Compared with the
   existing schemes, in terms of encrypting and decrypting computation

Abstract = {COSMO-SkyMed is an Earth Observation dual-use (civilian and Defence)
   system based on a constellation of four mid-sized satellites, in Low
   Earth Orbit, carrying multi-mode high resolution SAR instruments
   dedicated to resource management and security applications for civilian
   and Defence use.
   The operational capacity of COSMO-SkyMed has no world-wide competitors
   thank to the satellites overall nominal capability of sensing and
   downloading up to 1800 images every day. During the last 6 years
   COSMO-SkyMed has been employed to provide ``Institutional Awareness{''},
   in order to make proper decisions to prevent, respond and manage
   world-wide crises, to assess damages and supply fundamental information
   to rescue from catastrophic situations.
   Even though the first two satellites have already reached their nominal
   End-of-Life, the constellation is still able to provide the products
   with the required image quality and geolocation performance, fully
   sustaining the associated operational loads and granting the required
   level of service in terms of availability and efficiency.
   The second generation of the system (COSMO-SkyMed di Seconda
   Generazione, CSG) is being developed. After an interim phase, CSG will
   become a unique integrated system able to manage a constellation of up
   to 6 satellites (2 CSG and up to 4 first generation satellites),
   granting the operational continuity with the first generation system.},

Abstract = {In cloud-assisted electronic health (eHealth) systems, outsourced
   electronic health records (EHRs) have attribute-value type formats: an
   EHR corresponds to an entry with a unique identity and has multiple
   types of attribute values. Such formatted EHRs form an attribute-value
   type database, where both the attribute values and unique identities can
   serve as keywords for searching. Since EHRs are very sensitive, they are
   always encrypted before being outsourced, which makes retrieval of
   target EHRs by either identity or attribute value hard. Moreover, the
   EHRs are encrypted by different doctors, a researcher, who is delegated
   to research a certain kind of disease, cannot find out all corresponding
   EHRs due to the difference of encryption keys. In this article, we
   construct a triple dictionary index structure for the attribute-value
   type database to allow a researcher to retrieve encrypted EHRs by the
   identity and attribute value and to perform dynamic operations over
   them. We employ an identity server to assist doctors in generating
   encryption keys via an oblivious way. By doing so, the researcher can
   retrieve encrypted EHRs without leaking any information to the identity
   server. We analyze the security and evaluate the performance of our
   scheme to demonstrate that it achieves \$L\$-adaptive security and
   forward security with high efficiency.},

Title = {Adaptively secure multi-authority attribute-based broadcast encryption
   in fog computing},
Journal = {COMPUTER NETWORKS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {232},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Fog computing is considered an important development in cloud computing,
   with shorter response times, less data transfer load and a more secure
   distributed service architecture that can be accessed by a wide range of
   end devices. As with cloud computing, it also faces the challenge of how
   to securely distribute sensitive data. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based
   Broadcast Encryption (CP-ABBE) can protect sensitive data and provide
   fine-grained access control with user revocation. However, existing
   CP-ABBE schemes suffer many limitations when implemented in a fog
   computing environment: a single authority performs poorly in handling
   requests or data from many IoT devices, leading to system delays or
   limited functionality; expensive decryption costs make the computation
   and storage overheads unfriendly to devices with limited resources;
   these schemes are only proven selectively secure, meaning that security
   was proven in a weaker model. In this paper, using threshold secret
   sharing and decryption delegation, we propose an adaptively secure
   attribute-based multi-authority broadcast encryption (MA-ABBE) scheme
   that breaks through these limitations. The comparison and analysis
   results show that our scheme is practical and achieves adaptive
   security, enables user-side fast decryption and low storage overhead,
   and provides a secure and efficient option for protecting sensitive data
   in fog computing environments.},

Abstract = {This paper revisits Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE),
   allowing delegation of keys, traceability of compromised keys, and key
   anonymity, as additional properties.
   Whereas delegation of rights has been addressed in the seminal paper by
   Goyal et al. in 2006, introducing KP-ABE, this feature has almost been
   neglected in all subsequent works in favor of better security levels.
   However, in multi-device scenarios, this is quite important to allow
   users to independently authorize their own devices, and thus to delegate
   their initial rights with possibly more restrictions to their
   everyday-use devices. But then, one may also require tracing
   capabilities in case of corrupted devices and anonymity for the users
   and their devices.
   To this aim, we define a new variant of KP-ABE including delegation,
   with switchable attributes, in both the ciphertexts and the keys, and
   new indistinguishability properties. We then provide a concrete and
   efficient instantiation with adaptive security under the sole SXDH
   assumption in the standard model. We eventually explain how this new
   primitive can address all our initial goals.},

Abstract = {Conventionally, the security of critical infrastructures was mainly
   focused on environmental threats. Cyber attacks, nevertheless, have
   shifted the attention to various other threats and damages. The
   attackers try to exploit vulnerabilities in networks and Internet of
   Things (IoT) technologies, since these technologies are the integral
   part of the critical systems. Therefore, the vulnerability of Critical
   Infrastructure (CI) against cyber threats has led the need to devise
   modern security measures. Unavailability or failure of one CI can cause
   enormous devastation and damage to the society, economy and stability by
   provoking cascading failures to many other related infrastructures.
   Traditional security measures attempt to cater well-known emerging
   threats; however, strong and adaptive security measures/techniques are
   inevitable to defend against innovative attacks. This paper presents a
   survey on cyber threats and defense measures to highlight the necessity
   for securing SCADA-based critical infrastructures and provides an
   insight into the security challenges and open issues in this regard. (C)

Abstract = {Security of cloud storage has drawn more and more concerns. In the
   searchable encryption, many previous solutions can let people retrieve
   the documents containing single keyword or conjunctive keywords by
   storing encrypted documents with data indexes. However, searching
   documents with a phrase or consecutive keywords is still a remained open
   problem. In this paper, using the relative positions, we propose an
   efficient scheme LPSSE with symmetric searchable encryption that can
   support encrypted phrase searches in cloud storage. Our scheme is based
   on non-adaptive security definition by R.Curtmola and with lower costs
   of transmission and storage than existing systems. Furthermore, we
   combine some components of currently efficient search engines and our
   functions to complete a prototype. The experiment results also show that
   our scheme LPSSE is available and efficient.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a novel multi-modal biometric based encryption scheme for
   medical images is proposed. It is based upon the ever-secure Advanced
   Encryption Standard Cipher Block Chaining (AES-CBC) mode of encryption
   and Indexing-First One (IFO) hashing for the generation of the secret
   keys. The proposed system utilizes two biometrics of the user, the iris
   and the fingerprint, but instead of using the features of the biometrics
   directly, they are hashed through the IFO process to create a secret key
   that can be revoked and regenerated in case of a compromise ensuring the
   security of the users biometrics. The IFO hashes obtained from the
   biometric feature vectors are then used as two different secret keys in
   a two round AES-CBC system to encrypt the medical image. The medical
   image can be decrypted by performing the AES-CBC rounds in reverse with
   the correct keys, meaning that with high probability, only the correct
   user will be able to decrypt the image. This encryption technique
   improves upon many existing medical encryption schemes based on
   biometrics, which do not take the protection of the biometric template
   into account. We were able to perform one full key generation,
   encryption and decryption in .027 seconds. In addition, this processes
   is lossless, meaning that there is no change in the pixels of the
   medical image during the encryption or decryption process, which is
   necessary of a medical image encryption system.},

Abstract = {We describe the development and testing of hollow core glass waveguides
   (i.e., fiber optics) for use in Mid-Wave Infrared (MWIR) and Long-Wave
   Infrared (LWIR) spectroscopy systems. Spectroscopy measurements in these
   wavelength regions (i.e., from 3 to 14 mu m) are useful for detecting
   trace chemical compounds for a variety of security and defense related
   applications, and fiber optics are a key enabling technology needed to
   improve the utility and effectiveness of detection and calibration
   systems. Hollow glass fibers have the advantage over solid-core fibers
   (e. g., chalcogenide) in that they are less fragile, do not produce
   cladding modes, do not require angle cleaving or antireflection coatings
   to minimize laser feedback effects, and effectively transmit deeper into
   the infrared. This paper focuses on recent developments in hollow fiber
   technology geared specifically for infrared spectroscopy, including
   single mode beam delivery with relatively low bending loss. Results are
   presented from tests conducted using both Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCL)
   and CO2 lasers operating in the LWIR wavelength regime. Single-mode
   waveguides are shown to effectively deliver beams with relatively low
   loss (similar to 1 dB/m) and relatively high beam quality. The fibers
   are also shown to effectively mode-filter the ``raw{''} multi-mode
   output from a QCL, in effect damping out the higher order modes to
   produce a circularly symmetric Gaussian-like beam profile.},

Abstract = {Binary tree encryption is an intriguing primitive that enables many
   practical applications to achieve an increasing important security
   feature, forward security. However, the public key size of existing
   constructions grows linearly with the depth of the underlying binary
   tree in the standard model. To support more secret keys associated with
   nodes, it is often expected that the tree has a sufficiently large
   depth. This places a burden on employing it implicitly or explicitly in
   real world. In this work, we show how to compress linear-size public key
   down to constant-size public key and give our construction featuring
   constant-size public key in the standard model. We prove that our
   construction achieves an improved security, adaptive security, under the
   matrix decision Diffie-Hellman assumption, which is a generalization of
   standard k-Lin assumption. Moreover, our key-generation, key-derivation
   and encryption algorithms have lower time complexity than that of the
   prior construction, leading to further efficiency improvements. To
   illustrate these improvements in practice, we give an implementation of
   our construction and the prior one and then evaluate the performance in
   the tree depth.},

Abstract = {In recent years, building automation systems have become a widely
   accepted technology with dedicated but stand-alone solutions existing
   for a variety of application domains. Data exchange across domain
   borders is - if at all - realized by interconnecting these networks at
   the management level. Thus, the next step is to realize end-to-end data
   exchange already at the device level. The resulting vertically
   integrated systems can host domain-spanning applications and make way
   for secured end-to-end communication among any group of devices. This is
   considered especially important if security-relevant information shall
   be exchanged.
   This paper presents an adaptive security layer protocol architecture
   that is capable of operating on heterogenous networks. The modular
   framework, is designed to support virtually any combination of network
   protocols and applications that meet the requirements best. Through a
   plugin-based approach, easy extension and reuse of existing protocol
   mechanisms is achieved.},

Title = {Identity-Based Revocation From Subset Difference Methods Under Simple
   Assumptions},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {60333-60347},
Abstract = {Identity-based revocation (IBR) is a specific kind of broadcast
   encryption that can effectively send ciphertext to a set of receivers.
   In IBR, a ciphertext is associated with a set of revoked users instead
   of a set of receivers and the maximum number of users in the system can
   be an exponential value in the security parameter. In this paper, we
   reconsider the general method of Lee et al. (ESORICS 2014) that
   constructs a public-key revocation (PKR) scheme by combining the subset
   difference (SD) method of Naor, Naor, and Lotspiech (CRYPTO 2001) and a
   single revocation encryption (SRE) scheme. Lee et al. left it as an open
   problem to construct an SRE scheme under the standard assumption without
   random oracles. In this paper, we first propose a selectively secure SRE
   scheme under the standard assumption without random oracles. We also
   propose a fully secure SRE scheme under simple static assumptions
   without random oracles. Next, we present an efficient IBR scheme that
   supports fast decryption by combining the SD method and our SRE scheme.
   The security of our IBR scheme depends on that of the underlying SRE
   scheme. Finally, we implemented our SRE and IBR schemes and measured the
   performance.},

Abstract = {The potential impacts of man-made and natural disasters on chemical
   plants, complexes, and supply chains are of great importance to homeland
   security. To be able to estimate these impacts, we developed an
   agent-based chemical supply chain model that includes: chemical plants
   with enterprise operations such as purchasing, production scheduling,
   and inventories; merchant chemical markets, and multi-modal chemical
   shipments. Large-scale simulations of chemical-plant activities and
   supply chain interactions, running on desktop computers, are used to
   estimate the scope and duration of disruptive-event impacts, and overall
   system resilience, based on the extent to which individual chemical
   plants can adjust their internal operations (e.g., production mixes and
   levels) versus their external interactions (market sales and purchases,
   and transportation routes and modes). To illustrate how the model
   estimates the impacts of a hurricane disruption, a simple example model
   centered on 1,4-butanediol is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   IPE2, both secure under the eXternal Diffie-Hellman assumption (SXDH) in
   asymmetric pairing groups. The first scheme has constant-size
   ciphertexts whereas the second one is weakly attribute hiding. IPE2 is
   derived from the identity-based encryption scheme of Jutla Roy
   (Asiacrypt 2013), that was extended from tag-based quasi-adaptive
   non-interactive zero-knowledge (QA-NIZK) proofs for linear subspaces of
   vector spaces over bilinear groups. The verifier common reference string
   (CRS) in these tag-based systems are split into two parts, that are
   combined during verification. We consider an alternate form of the
   tag-based QA-NIZK proof with a single verifier CRS that already includes
   a tag, different from the one defining the language. The verification
   succeeds as long as the two tags are unequal. Essentially, we embed a
   two-equation revocation mechanism in the verification. The new QA-NIZK
   proof system leads to IPE1, a constant-sized ciphertext IPE scheme with
   very short ciphertexts. Both the IPE schemes are obtained by applying
   the n-equation revocation technique of Attrapadung and Libert (PKC 2010)
   to the corresponding identity based encryption schemes and proved secure
   under SXDH assumption. As an application, we show how our schemes can be
   specialised to obtain the first fully secure identity-based broadcast
   encryption based on SXDH with a trade-off among the public parameters,
   ciphertext and key sizes, all of them being sub-linear in the maximum
   number of recipients of a broadcast.},

Abstract = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a special type of cryptosystem,
   which provide encryption and decryption functions based on users
   attributes. Due to the functionality and flexibility of ABE, it is
   considered to be suitable for providing data security and privacy
   preserving security in the cloud storage environment. However, lack of
   user revocation mechanism is considered to be a disadvantage of
   traditional ABE. In this paper, we study the direct revocation mechanism
   of ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE), construct a new directly revocable
   CP-ABE in the composite order group, and prove it to achieve adaptive
   security using dual system encryption in the standard model. On this
   basis, we introduce user revocation centre (URC) in this system, and
   outsource the revocation tasks to URC. Users need not to master the
   latest revocation list for encrypting, and need not to pay any
   additional computing for revocation. In addition, when revocation list
   changes, URC can update the ciphertexts for users. Finally, we introduce
   how to deploy our schemes in cloud storage environment.},

Abstract = {In the last couple of years, it has become obvious that embedded systems
   are integral parts of our every day lives. This omnipresence as well as
   the wireless nature of many embedded applications give rise to the need
   for sophisticated security and privacy preserving mechanisms. Trusted
   Computing is a promising new approach for computer security in which a
   system should be permanently in a well-defined and therefore trustworthy
   state. The adaption of such concepts for embedded systems with
   application specific requirements and limitations can provide promising
   security benefits. Besides, both in the industrial and academical sector
   a trend has become apparent to develop chips which include programmable
   cores as well as system reconfigurable components. Resultant chips will
   not be a single part of an embedded system anymore but rather can be
   used for the development of a whole system. Thus, FPGAs have become
   integral parts of embedded computing platforms. The reconfigurability of
   FPGAs offers major advantages when using them for cryptographic
   applications and it is suggested that an adaptive hardware-based trust
   anchor can greatly enhance the overall security level of an embedded
   system. In this paper we propose a concept of how such an adaptive
   security module could be designed as well as some possible fields of
   application. A key focus of this ongoing research work is the
   development of a flexible FPGA-based security architecture.},

Abstract = {Erasing old data and keys is an important tool in cryptographic protocol
   design. It is useful in many settings, including proactive security,
   adaptive security, forward security, and intrusion resilience. Protocols
   for all these settings typically assume the ability to perfectly erase
   information. Unfortunately, as amply demonstrated in the systems
   literature, perfect erasures are hard to implement in practice.
   We propose a model of partial erasures where erasure instructions leave
   almost all the data erased intact, thus giving the honest players only a
   limited capability for disposing of old data. Nonetheless, we provide a
   general compiler that transforms any secure protocol using perfect
   erasures into one that maintains the same security properties when only
   partial erasures are available. The key idea is a new redundant
   representation of secret data which can still be computed on, and yet is
   rendered useless when partially erased. We prove that any such a
   compiler must incur a cost in additional storage, and that our compiler
   is near optimal in terms of its storage overhead.},

Abstract = {Modern cyber attackers use sophisticated, highly-automated vulnerability
   search and exploit development tools to find new ways to break into
   target computers. To protect against such threats, we are developing
   FUZZBUSTER, a host-based adaptive security system that automatically
   discovers faults in hosted applications and incrementally refines and
   repairs the underlying vulnerabilities. To perform this self-adaptation,
   FUZZBUSTER uses meta-control to coordinate a diverse and growing set of
   custom and off-the-shelf fuzz-testing tools. FUZZBUSTER's greedy
   meta-control strategy considers adaptation deadlines, the exploit
   potential of vulnerabilities, the usage schedule of vulnerable
   applications, and the expected performance of its various fuzz-testing
   and adaptation tools. In this paper, we demonstrate how FUZZBUSTER's
   meta-control reasons efficiently about these factors, managing task
   selection to maximize the system's safety and effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Today internet based e-commerce has become a trend and business
   necessity. Security of online e-commerce over the Internet is provided
   through Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS). The
   SSL/TLS uses public key cryptographic algorithms which are computational
   intensive due to the modular multiplications. Therefore, SSL/TLS servers
   often become overloaded while performing public key decryptions when the
   simultaneous requests increase rapidly. Overload can lead e-commerce
   applications to considerable revenue losses, response times may grow to
   unacceptable levels and as a result the server may saturate even crash.
   So load management of SSL/TLS web server is a critical issue in
   e-commerce. The proposed work in this paper is to manage load on the
   server by applying Adaptive SSL policy and session handling mechanism.
   This policy is self-adaptive security, which offers great potential in
   providing timely and fine grained security control on server, by runtime
   adaptation of cryptographic algorithm. The implementation results in
   more efficient system with better throughput and response time.},

Title = {Adaptively secure CP-ABE for circuits with fan-in n and fan-out 1},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 23},
Abstract = {The attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme is suitable for access
   control of ciphertext in cloud computing. Kowalczyk and Wee proposed an
   adaptively secure attribute-based encryption scheme that supports NC1
   circuits. However, the cipher text length increases rapidly with the
   depth of the circuit, resulting in an increase of the computational
   complexity of the encryption and decryption algorithms. In this paper,
   to overcome this challenge, a ciphertext-policy ABE scheme that supports
   circuits with fan-in n is proposed. First, we design new pebble rules
   for secret sharing in circuits with fan-in n, improving the compactness
   of the security reduction. Then, the new secret sharing scheme is
   embedded in the encryption algorithm, which is the key to improving
   efficiency. Moreover, we prove the adaptive security of the scheme by
   using a piecewise guessing framework and dual-system encryption.
   Finally, by comparison analysis, this scheme exhibits a better
   performance.},

Title = {Identification of damage in composite structures using Gaussian mixture
   model-processed Lamb waves},
Journal = {SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Composite materials have comprehensively better properties than
   traditional materials, and therefore have been more and more widely
   used, especially because of its higher strength-weight ratio. However,
   the damage of composite structures is usually varied and complicated. In
   order to ensure the security of these structures, it is necessary to
   monitor and distinguish the structural damage in a timely manner. Lamb
   wave-based structural health monitoring (SHM) has been proved to be
   effective in online structural damage detection and evaluation;
   furthermore, the characteristic parameters of the multi-mode Lamb wave
   varies in response to different types of damage in the composite
   material. This paper studies the damage identification approach for
   composite structures using the Lamb wave and the Gaussian mixture model
   (GMM). The algorithm and principle of the GMM, and the parameter
   estimation, is introduced. Multistatistical characteristic parameters of
   the excited Lamb waves are extracted, and the parameter space with
   reduced dimensions is adopted by principal component analysis (PCA). The
   damage identification system using the GMM is then established through
   training. Experiments on a glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composite
   laminate plate are conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed
   approach in terms of damage classification. The experimental results
   show that different types of damage can be identified according to the
   value of the likelihood function of the GMM.},

   Re-Encryption Scheme for Securing Group Message},

Abstract = {Puncturable proxy re-encryption (PPRE) is envisioned to provide secure
   access control delegation and fine-grained forward security for
   asynchronous group messaging systems. Nevertheless, the existing PPRE
   scheme not only suffers from the burden of certificate management but
   also merely achieves selective security based on the nonstandard
   assumption. In this article, a puncturable identity-based PRE (P-IB-PRE)
   scheme is proposed to efficiently protect the security and privacy of
   the group message. The proposed scheme introduces a message server as
   the proxy to transform ciphertext for each participant in the group;
   thus, the heavy computation overhead is delegated to the message server
   with abundant resources. Most importantly, our scheme enables the
   recipient to revoke its private key's decryption capability of the
   specific messages without affecting other messages. Moreover, the
   identity-based mechanism eliminates the burden of certificate management
   as well as improves efficiency. The proposed scheme achieves adaptive
   security under the standard decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH)
   assumption. Eventually, theoretical and experimental analyses
   demonstrate that the proposed scheme has an excellent performance in
   efficiency and practicality.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the cybersecurity attacks on the internet of things
   (IoT)-based healthcare systems became the major concern for researchers
   and health organizations. With time, the sophistication of these attacks
   is increasing. Therefore, healthcare service providers must implement
   efficient security mechanisms carefully while taking the advantages of
   connected devices without compromising the patient safety and disturbing
   the real-time health services. A digital twin (DT) is a virtual
   representation of a real-time counterpart of a physical world. DT offers
   significant advantages to cybersecurity experts, empowering them to
   predict risks without entering the physical world, and to simulate and
   test cyber-attacks that would otherwise be infeasible to do in real-time
   in the physical environment. DT in healthcare helps to identify security
   vulnerabilities, conduct attack simulations, and potential security
   breaches by creating a virtual replica of the targeted healthcare
   systems. In this paper, a novel and automated conceptual framework is
   developed for reinforcing the cybersecurity in IoT-based healthcare
   using DT technology. It includes the conceptualization and analysis of
   the proposed framework which can provide dynamic and adaptive security
   solution to identify real-time threats and vulnerabilities in IoT-based
   healthcare applications.},

Abstract = {As healthcare in many countries faces an aging population and rising
   costs, mobile sensing technologies promise a new opportunity. Using
   mobile health (mHealth) sensing, which uses medical sensors to collect
   data about the patients, and mobile phones to act as a gateway between
   sensors and electronic health record systems, caregivers can
   continuously monitor the patients and deliver better care. Furthermore,
   individuals can become better engaged in monitoring and managing their
   own health. Although some work on mHealth sensing has addressed
   security, achieving strong privacy for low-power sensors remains a
   challenge. We make three contributions. First, we propose an mHealth
   sensing protocol that provides strong security and privacy properties at
   the link layer, with low energy overhead, suitable for low-power
   sensors. The protocol uses three novel techniques: adaptive security, to
   dynamically modify transmission overhead; MAC striping, to make forgery
   difficult even for small-sized Message Authentication Codes; and
   asymmetric resource requirements, in recognition of the limited
   resources in tiny mHealth sensors. Second, we demonstrate its
   feasibility by implementing a prototype on a Chronos wrist device, and
   evaluating it experimentally. Third, we provide a security, privacy, and
   energy analysis of our system.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {Intrusion detection is a fundamental part of security tools, such as
   adaptive security appliances, intrusion detection systems, intrusion
   prevention systems, and firewalls. Various intrusion detection
   techniques are used, but their performance is an issue. Intrusion
   detection performance depends on accuracy, which needs to improve to
   decrease false alarms and to increase the detection rate. To resolve
   concerns on performance, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine
   (SVM), and other techniques have been used in recent work. Such
   techniques indicate limitations and are not effcient for use in large
   data sets, such as system and network data. The intrusion detection
   system is used in analyzing huge traffc data; thus, an effcient
   classifcation technique is necessary to overcome the issue. This problem
   is considered in this paper. Well-known machine learning techniques,
   namely, SVM, random forest, and extreme learning machine (ELM) are
   applied. These techniques are well-known because of their capability in
   classifcation. The NSL-knowledge discovery and data mining data set is
   used, which is considered a benchmark in the evaluation of intrusion
   detection mechanisms. The results indicate that ELM outperforms other
   approaches.},

Abstract = {Integrated photonics have many compelling advantages for computing and
   communication applications, including in high-speed and extremely wide
   bandwidth operations. Current systems are typically hybrid assemblies of
   packaged photonic devices where printed circuit boards often serve to
   route electrical signals and power, and in some cases, have runs of
   optical fibers. We present a flexible, low cost assembly method of
   optical interconnects for photonic systems that could enable higher
   transmission rates, lower power requirements, improved signal integrity
   and timing, less heat generation, and improved security of communication
   signals. The new process is based on laser enhanced direct print
   additive manufacturing (LE-DPAM) that combines fused deposition modeling
   (FDM) of plastic, micro-dispensing of rubber-like materials, and
   picosecond laser subtraction. The process is demonstrated by fabricating
   few-mode and multi-mode optical fibers in a controlled manner such that
   compact, 3-dimensional optical interconnects can be printed along
   non-lineal paths. We have produced working optical interconnects with
   fiber core diameters from 70-mu m to as small as 12-mu m. Our results
   demonstrate surface roughness of less than 100 nm, and optical
   transmitted power of 63\% that of a commercial fiber, for proof of
   concept devices. We anticipate these devices to be a starting point in
   the development of more sophisticated electro-optical computing devices
   using this new LE-DPAM technique. The LE-DPAM approach could lead to
   large scale integrated photonic computing devices that would replace our
   current generation of servers, computers, and phones.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of transparently authenticating a
   user to a local terminal (e.g., a desktop computer) as she approaches
   towards the terminal. Given its appealing usability, such zero-effort
   authentication has already been deployed in the real-world where a
   computer terminal or a vehicle can be unlocked by the mere proximity of
   an authentication token (e.g., a smartphone). However, existing systems
   based on a single authentication factor contains one major security
   weakness - unauthorized physical access to the token, e.g., during
   lunch-time or upon theft, allows the attacker to have unfettered access
   to the terminal.
   We introduce ZEMFA, a zero-effort multi-factor authentication system
   based on multiple authentication tokens and multi-modal behavioral
   biometrics. Specifically, ZEMFA utilizes two types of authentication
   tokens, a smartphone and a smartwatch (or a bracelet) and two types of
   gait patterns captured by these tokens, mid/lower body movements
   measured by the phone and wrist/arm movements captured by the watch.
   Since a user's walking or gait pattern is believed to be unique, only
   that user (no impostor) would be able to gain access to the terminal
   even when the impostor is given access to both of the authentication
   tokens. We present the design and implementation of ZEMFA. We
   demonstrate that ZEMFA offers a high degree of detection accuracy, based
   on multi-sensor and multi-device fusion. We also show that ZEMFA can
   resist active attacks that attempt to mimic a user's walking pattern,
   especially when multiple devices are used.},

Abstract = {Broadcast encryption schemes rely on a centralized authority to generate
   decryption keys for each user. It is observed that, when a broadcast
   encryption scheme is deployed for secret escrows, a dishonest dealer can
   read the escrowed secrets without leaving any witnesses. We present a
   new broadcast encryption paradigm referred to as fully distributed
   broadcast encryption (FDBE) without suffering from this vulnerability.
   In the new paradigm, there are multiple dealers, and by contacting a
   number of them equal to a threshold or more, any user can join the
   system; then the secrets can be encrypted to any subset of users and
   only the intended receivers can decrypt, while an attacker cannot get
   any information about the encrypted message even if the attacker
   controls all the users outside the receiver set and corrupts some
   dealers, provided that the number of corrupted dealers is less than a
   threshold. We realize the first fully distributed broadcast encryption
   scheme which is proven secure under the decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman
   Exponentiation assumption in the standard model. A variant is also shown
   to achieve sub-linear complexity in terms of public key, decryption key
   and ciphertext, comparable to up-to-date regular broadcast encryption
   schemes without robustness and strong security against misbehaving
   dealers.},

Abstract = {Multimodal hearing aids (HAs) aim to deliver more intelligible audio in
   noisy environments by contextually sensing and processing data in the
   form of not only audio but also visual information (e.g. lip reading).
   Machine learning techniques can play a pivotal role for the contextual
   processing of multimodal data, however, due to the low computational
   power of the HA devices, the data must be processed either on the edge
   or cloud which, in turn, poses privacy concerns for the users' sensitive
   data. Existing literature proposes several techniques for data
   encryption but their computational complexity is a major bottleneck to
   meet strict latency requirements for the development of future
   multi-modal hearing aids. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes
   a novel real-time audio/visual data encryption scheme based on
   chaos-based encryption using the Tangent-Delay Ellipse Reflecting
   Cavity-Map System (TD-ERCS) and Non-linear Chaotic (NCA) Algorithms. The
   results achieved against different security analysis parameters such as
   Correlation Coefficient, Unified Averaged Changed Intensity (UACI), Key
   Sensitivity Analysis, Number of Changing Pixel Rate (NPCR), Mean-Square
   Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Entropy test, and
   Chi-test, indicate that the proposed scheme is more secure with
   increased key-space against modern brute-force attacks and lightweight
   as compared to existing schemes.},

Abstract = {In this modern era of the digital world, the patient's medical records
   are electronically maintained and updated for the maintenance of the
   good health. The electronically stored patients' health status is termed
   as the Electronic Patient Record (EPR). The EPR service includes the
   accessing, storage, and maintenance by the authenticated users. However,
   in the emergency situation, the EPR can be required by the
   unauthenticated users/physician. In these situations, the primary
   challenge is to prove the identity of an unknown physician/user. In
   these cases, there is a need for an adaptive security mechanism, where
   the adaptive mechanism includes intelligence to identify the emergency
   situation and adapt subsequently. In the health care, the privacy,
   integrity and access control over the generated data places an important
   role. To address these issues in this paper, we use a structural design
   that involves procedure based and distributed management in conviction
   to afford an elastic method to access the electronically stored records
   depending on the users' digital identification.},

Abstract = {Massive data are generated and collected by devices in the industrial
   Internet of Things. Data sources would encrypt the data and send them to
   the data center through the gateway. For some supervision purpose, the
   gateway needs to observe the encrypted data stream and label the
   suspicious data. Instead of decrypting ciphertext at the gateway, which
   is not efficient, this paper presents a Phi-searchable functional
   encryption scheme that supports inner product evaluations on encrypted
   data. Based on this scheme, an approach enabling various queries on the
   encrypted industrial data stream is proposed. The adaptive security of
   our proposed underlying functional encryption scheme can be proven under
   general subgroup decision assumptions, and our scheme has the smaller
   public key, the smaller secret key, and the smaller ciphertext size
   compared to the related schemes. In addition, the experimental results
   show that our proposed scheme is efficient. Especially for the gateway,
   querying on the encrypted data only needs less than 20ms, which is
   practical for industrial data stream auditing scenario.},

Abstract = {This study presents a healthcare monitoring architecture coupled with

   sensors that collect a timely set of physiological health indicators
   transmitted via low energy wireless communication to mobile computing
   devices. Three application scenarios are implemented using the proposed
   network architecture. The group-based data collection and data
   transmission using the ad hoc mode promote outpatient healthcare
   services for only one medical staff member assigned to a set of
   patients. Adaptive security issues for data transmission are performed
   based on different wireless capabilities. This study also presents a
   monitoring application prototype for capturing sensor data from wireless
   sensor nodes. The implemented schemes were verified as performing
   efficiently and rapidly in the proposed network architecture.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes an adaptive security transmission scheme based on
   fountain code and channel feedback. The fountain code has such a
   characteristic that as long as the legitimate user correctly collects
   sufficient fountain packets before the malicious user does, information
   leakage can be voided and secure communication can be realized. Inspired
   by this insight, we develop a fountain coding mechanism which
   dynamically adjusts the fountain code construction via the feedback
   channel. Moreover, transmit power control is employed to enhance the
   rate of packet reception of the legitimate receiver. We analyse the
   performance of our scheme in terms of intercept probability and QoS
   violating probability. Numerical simulations verify our theoretical
   analysis results, and demonstrate that the proposed scheme enhances the
   system secrecy and reduces the decoding delay compared with the other
   previous schemes.},

Title = {Bounded-collusion decentralized ABE with sublinear parameters},
Journal = {THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {960},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a decentralized ABE scheme against bounded
   collusion which means the number of users in the system is a-prior
   bounded. The scheme enjoys public key and ciphertext of sublinear sizes
   in the number of users in the system while all prior constructions
   require linear sizes. Besides, our scheme achieves semi-adaptive
   security under bilateral k-Lin assumption and SXDH assumption in a
   pairing group. Keep the same as the previous constructions, the scheme
   supports monotone span program as a policy and does not rely on the
   random oracle. Technically, we follow Wang et al.'s ``linear secret
   sharing scheme (LSSS) + inner-product functional encryption (IPFE){''}
   paradigm {[}PKC'19] and use (an extended variant of) functional
   encryption for quadratic functions (QFE) in the place of IPFE. By this,
   we encrypt with sublinear-size random coins and later expand them to
   linear-size entropy for security proof. Roughly, the use of QFE requires
   bilateral k-Lin assumption while the entropy expansion relies on SXDH.

Abstract = {Leakage-resilient cryptography is proposed to address physical attacks
   on real world crypto-systems. Dual system encryption methodology is
   developed to guide design and analysis of various functional encryption
   schemes (FEs) with adaptive security. Observing the compatibility of
   dual system methodology and leakage-resilience, Lewko et al. present
   constructions of a number of strong leakage-resilient functional
   encryptions. In particular, they present fully secure identity-based
   encryption (IBE), hierarchical IBE (HIBE) and attribute-based encryption
   (ABE) satisfying the continual memory leakage (CML) model, one of the
   strongest models that allows continuous leakage on both user and master
   secret keys.
   Inspired by the recent work from Attrapadung on pair encodings which
   greatly simplifies the design and analysis of FE, we propose a generic
   framework for constructing fully secure FEs in the CML model (LR-FEs).
   Specifically, our framework ``compiles{''} predicate encodings into
   fully secure LR-FEs in a two-step process. Firstly, we propose a generic
   transformation of pair encoding schemes into their leakage-resilient
   forms. Next, we present another conversion that turns leakage-resilient
   pair encodings into fully secure LR-FEs. Our framework is highly
   compatible with Attrapadung's, meaning that it is applicable to many
   existing pair encoding schemes.
   The contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, our framework
   simplifies the design and analysis of LR-FEs into the design and
   analysis of predicate encodings. Secondly, our framework allows us to
   improve the security of some existing LR-FEs, such as LR-IBE with a
   tighter reduction. Thirdly, we discover new adaptively secure LR-FEs,
   including FE for regular languages, ABE for large universe and ABE with
   short ciphertext.},

Abstract = {Optical silicon (Si)-based materials are highly attractive due to their
   widespread applications ranging from electronics to biomedicine. It is
   worth noting that while extensive efforts have been devoted to
   developing fluorescent Si-based structures, there currently exist no
   examples of Si-based materials featuring phosphorescence emission,
   severely limiting Si-based wide-ranging optical applications. To address
   this critical issue, we herein introduce a kind of Si-based material, in
   which metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are in-situ growing on the surface
   of Si nanoparticles (SiNPs) assisted by microwave irradiation. Of
   particular significance, the resultant materials, i.e.,
   MOFs-encapsulated SiNPs (MOFs@SiNPs) could exhibit pH-responsive
   fluorescence, whose maximum emission wavelength is red-shifted from 442
   to 592 nm when the pH increases from 2 to 13. More importantly, distinct
   room-temperature phosphorescence (maximum emission wavelength: 505 nm)
   could be observed in this system, with long lifetime of 215 ms. Taking
   advantages of above-mentioned unique optical properties, the MOFs@SiNPs
   are further employed as high-quality anti-counterfeiting inks for
   advanced encryption. In comparison to conventional fluorescence
   anti-counterfeiting techniques (static fluorescence outputs are
   generally used, thus being easily duplicated and leading to
   counterfeiting risk), pH-responsive fluorescence and room-temperature
   phosphorescence of the resultant MOFs@SiNPs-based ink could offer
   advanced multi-modal security, which is therefore capable of realizing
   higher-level information security against counterfeiting.},

Abstract = {Game theory applies to scenarios wherein multiple players with contrary
   motives contend with each other. Various solutions based on Game theory
   have been recently proposed which dealt with security aspects of
   wireless sensor networks(WSNs). However, the nodes have limited
   capability of rationality and evolutionary learning which makes it
   unfavorable to apply conventional game theory in WSNs. Evolutionary Game
   Theory(EGT) relies on bounded rationality assumption which is in harmony
   with the wireless sensor networks characteristics. Based on EGT, authors
   propose an adaptive security model for WSNs for the selection of
   cryptographic protocols during runtime. The authors formulate this
   selection in WSNs with the help of an evolutionary game to obtain the
   evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the system. In this model, the
   sensor nodes dynamically adapt their defensive strategies to attain the
   most efficient defense, corresponding to the attackers' varied
   strategies. Further, the simulations convey that the proposed system
   converges rapidly to the Evolutionary Stable Strategy. Not only the
   system converges, but also forms a stable system which was verified by
   deliberately destabilizing the system. Results show that the nodes
   quickly return to ESS even after perturbation. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {Lewko and Waters introduced the computational hiding technique in
   Crypto'12. In their technique, two computational assumptions that
   achieve selective and co-selective security proofs lead to adaptive
   security of an encryption scheme. Later, pair encoding framework was
   introduced by Attrapadung in Eurocrypt'14. The pair encoding framework
   generalises the computational hiding technique for functional encryption
   (FE). It has been used to achieve a number of new FE schemes such as FE
   for regular languages and unbounded attribute based encryption allowing
   multi-use of attributes. Nevertheless, the generalised construction of
   Attrapadung's pair encoding for those schemes is adaptively secure only
   in composite order groups, which leads to efficiency loss. It remains a
   challenging task to explore constructions in prime order groups for
   gaining efficiency improvement, which leaves the research gap in the
   existing literature. In this work, we aim to address this drawback by
   proposing a new generalised construction for pair encodings in prime
   order groups. Our construction will lead to a number of new FE schemes
   in prime order groups, which have been previously introduced only in
   composite order groups by Attrapadung.},

Abstract = {Boneh, Waters and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2014) used multilinear maps to provide
   a solution to the long-standing problem of public-key broadcast
   encryption (BE) where all parameters in the system are small. In this
   work, we improve their result by providing a solution that uses only
   bilinear maps and Learning With Errors (LWE). Our scheme is fully
   collusion-resistant against any number of colluders, and can be
   generalized to an identity-based broadcast system with short parameters.
   Thus, we reclaim the problem of optimal broadcast encryption from the
   land of ``Obfustopia{''}.
   Our main technical contribution is a ciphertext policy attribute based
   encryption (CP-ABE) scheme which achieves special efficiency properties
   - its ciphertext size, secret key size, and public key size are all
   independent of the size of the circuits supported by the scheme. We show
   that this special CP-ABE scheme implies BE with optimal parameters; but
   it may also be of independent interest. Our constructions rely on a
   novel interplay of bilinear maps and LWE, and are proven secure in the
   generic group model.},

   possible by proposing a novel, feasible attack approach. Following it, a
   malicious user can eavesdrop on other users' downloads by transforming
   training sequences. To prevent this attack, we propose a secure CSI
   estimation scheme for instantaneous CSI. Furthermore, we extend this
   scheme to achieve adaptive security when CSI is relatively statistical.
   We have implemented our scheme for both uplink and downlink of MU-MIMO
   and performed a series of experiments. Results show that our secure CSI
   estimation scheme is highly effective in preventing downlink leakage
   against malicious users.},

Abstract = {The use of new technologies in vehicles, such as automation and
   connectivity, results in the addition of more software components, which
   in turn increases the potential vulnerabilities and attack surfaces for
   the vehicle. To address this, cybersecurity monitoring of vehicle fleets
   is required to detect and respond to potential cyber threats and
   vulnerabilities. The aim of this research is to explore a technological
   approach to fleet monitoring using established IT standards and
   techniques. The approach involves collecting, filtering, and forwarding
   cybersecurity information from multiple sources within the vehicle by
   instrumenting the ROS 2-based architecture and integrating these data
   sources with the log management tool syslog-ng. The logging
   configuration can be adapted at runtime using a ROS 2 interface that we
   developed. The approach is demonstrated with our fleet simulation setup
   ``Fleet in the Loop{''} and a sophisticated data collection in a
   Knowledge Graph. The approach at hand can be used to seamlessly
   integrate ROS 2 in common IT monitoring tools and efficiently increase
   the resilience of vehicles by integrating adaptive security monitoring.},

Abstract = {Motivation: Developing new crop varieties with superior performance is
   highly important to ensure robust and sustainable global food security.
   The speed of variety development is limited by long field cycles and
   advanced generation selections in plant breeding programs. While methods
   to predict yield from genotype or phenotype data have been proposed,
   improved performance and integrated models are needed. Results: We
   propose a machine learning model that leverages both genotype and
   phenotype measurements by fusing genetic variants with multiple data
   sources collected by unmanned aerial systems. We use a deep multiple
   instance learning framework with an attention mechanism that sheds light
   on the importance given to each input during prediction, enhancing
   interpretability. Our model reaches 0.75460.024 Pearson correlation
   coefficient when predicting yield in similar environmental conditions; a
   34.8\% improvement over the genotype-only linear baseline (0.55960.050).
   We further predict yield on new lines in an unseen environment using
   only genotypes, obtaining a prediction accuracy of 0.38660.010, a 13.5\%
   improvement over the linear baseline. Our multi-modal deep learning
   architecture efficiently accounts for plant health and environment,
   distilling the genetic contribution and providing excellent predictions.
   Yield prediction algorithms leveraging phenotypic observations during
   training therefore promise to improve breeding programs, ultimately
   speeding up delivery of improved varieties.},

Abstract = {Every year, web applications have expanded their presence in more areas
   in financial organizations, health organizations, public sector, retail
   and accommodation. Security is important in data protection so as not to
   be infringed by unauthorized parties. If the vulnerabilities found are
   not amended, it leads to cyber-attacks such as Structured Query Language
   Injection Attack (SQLIA) performed by certain parties which enable them
   to gain unauthorized data access. To cater security issues, variety of
   security frameworks for secure software development life cycle (SDLC)
   were introduced. Secure SDLC is created by integrating security-related
   activities to an each phase of in used development methodologies such as
   waterfall model or agile model. However, the application security
   problem continues to grow. Strict, complicated and heavyweight
   frameworks are underutilized due to several factors. The factors that
   influence the implementation of secure SDLC identified in public sector
   (the scope is State Secretary Offices in Malaysia) are inadequate
   development timeline, improper development team size and less awareness
   of team members' workload. It is agreed that integrating security at
   earlier (requirement and design) phase is the most effective and
   cheapest way to develop secure web application. Hence, an adaptive
   secure SDLC model is proposed to integrate security activities using
   Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) focusing on the influence
   factors as the main criteria and meet the international and local secure
   frameworks standards. The proposed model will recommend adaptive
   security activities as a guideline to be applied at earlier phases of
   SDLC to help eliminate/minimize the web application vulnerabilities and
   increase the application security and implemented as a proof-of-concept
   prototype at selected Malaysian public sector for in-house web
   application development.},

Abstract = {We propose a new generic framework for constructing fully secure
   attribute based encryption (ABE) in multilinear settings. It is
   applicable in a generic manner to any predicates. Previous generic
   frameworks of this kind are given only in bilinear group settings, where
   applicable predicate classes are limited. Our framework provides an
   abstraction of dual system paradigms over composite-order graded
   multilinear encoding schemes in a black-box manner.
   As applications, we propose new fully secure ABE systems for general
   predicates, namely, ABE for circuits. We obtain two schemes for each of
   key-policy (KP) and ciphertext-policy (CP) variants of ABE. All of our
   four fully secure schemes can deal with unbounded-size circuits, while
   enjoy succinctness, meaning that the key and ciphertext sizes are (less
   than or) proportional to corresponding circuit sizes. In the CP-ABE
   case, no scheme ever achieves such properties, even when considering
   selectively secure systems. Furthermore, our second KP-ABE achieves
   constant-size ciphertexts, whereas our second CP-ABE achieves
   constant-size keys. Previous ABE systems for circuits are either
   selectively secure (Gorbunov et al. STOC'13, Garg et al. Crypto'13, and
   subsequent works), or semi-adaptively secure (Brakerski and
   Vaikuntanathan Crypto' 16), or fully-secure but not succinct and
   restricted to bounded-size circuits (Garg et al. ePrint 2014/622, and
   Garg et al. TCC' 16-A).},

Abstract = {Reactor Pressure Vessel (hereinafter RPV) is the core component of PWR
   nuclear power plants. The nuclear power plants operation experience
   shows that the dangerous defects could produce in the material of Bottom
   Mounted Instrument and J type weld(hereinafter BMI). In early nuclear
   power plants, the BMI is made of corrosion-sensitive materials (such as
   Alloy 600). The stress corrosion crack is easy to grow up and destroy
   the integrity of RPV in operation. Therefore, inspection for BMI during
   the service stage is necessary to ensure the integrity of the primary
   circuit pressure boundary.
   The BMI is general made of Alloy 600 or Alloy 690 and penetrate the
   reactor pressure vessel lower head vertically to form J type weld on the
   inner wall of the RPV lower head. The inner diameter is generally 15 to
   16 mm and the wall thickness is about 15 mm. In order to improve the
   welding performance, the dissimilar metal J-type weld groove is usually
   overlaid with nickel-based pre-heap edge. The component structural and
   material characteristics have brought great difficulties to the test
   technology research as well as the location.
   In this paper, the main failure modes of BMI are introduced and the
   technical requirements of in-service inspections are presented. The
   technical scheme and inspection system are designed according to the
   above requirements and weld structural characteristics. Both UT and ET
   methods are used for the inspection. UT is based on the time of flight
   diffraction (hereinafter TOFD) technique. According to the structural
   and material characteristics of the BMI, many researches have been done
   on block with simulated defect, and characteristic rule of defect
   indication signals in different areas are summarized. Then, the optimal
   design parameters of the TOFD probe are gained and the disadvantages of
   ultrasonic inspection are overcome. The eddy current inspection system
   adopts the inspection technology with the Bobbin probe and the rotary
   point probe combined together. The use of its surface and near the
   surface of the detection ability has become a powerful complement to
   ultrasonic testing. From the test result, TOFD probe has high defect
   height measurement accuracy. Measurement error isn't more than 1mm and
   mostly is positive deviation. The surface defects with a height of not
   less than 2 mm can be measured.
   Considering the complex geometry of BMI, the multi mode multi-axis
   scanning program and remote automatic docking device are used in the
   system. The multi-mode multi axis scanning program can be achieved axial
   and circumferential rotation of the probe with the axial positioning
   accuracy within 2mm and circumferential positioning accuracy within 3
   degrees. The remote automatic docking device can be used to connect the
   bottom of the mechanical device and the top of the BMI in fast and
   seamless security to avoid the mechanical device bumping of the
   component. The probe connecting shaft is made of flexible material,
   which avoids the violent bumping of the tested parts and greatly
   enhances the safety of the equipment operation. The system simulates the
   actual scanning environment by establishing three-dimensional model and
   testing it on the simulation body.},

Abstract = {A (public key) Trace and Revoke Scheme combines the functionality of
   broadcast encryption with the capability of traitor tracing.
   Specifically, (1) a trusted center publishes a single public key and
   distributes individual secret keys to the users of the system; (2)
   anybody can encrypt a message so that all but a specified subset of
   ``revoked{''} users can decrypt the resulting ciphertext; and (3) if a
   (small) group of users combine their secret keys to produce a ``pirate
   decoder{''}, the center can trace at least one of the ``traitors{''}
   given access to this decoder. We construct the first chosen ciphertext
   (CCA2) secure Trace and Revoke Scheme based on the DDH assumption. Our
   scheme is also the first adaptively secure scheme, allowing the
   adversary to corrupt players at any point during execution, while prior
   works (e.g., {[}14, 16]) only achieves a very weak form of non-adaptive
   security even against chosen plaintext attacks.
   Of independent interest, we present a slightly simpler construction that
   shows a ``natural separation{''} between the classical notion of
   CCA2-security and the recently proposed {[}15, 1] relaxed notion of
   gCCA2-security.},

Abstract = {Internet and computer networks are facing an increasing number of
   security threats. With new types of attacks that appear continuously,
   the development of flexible and adaptive security is a serious
   challenge. In this field, approaches of network-based intrusion
   detection are ideal techniques to protect target systems and networks
   from destructive actions. Depending on the analytical model, this
   technique is divided into signature-based and anomaly-based models.
   Signature-based model focuses on known attacks or their obvious features
   by matching patterns of behavior with a predefined byte string. The
   biggest problem with this model is that it is not able to detect new
   attacks if the software does not have their signatures defined in the
   database. Anomaly-based model specifies normal behavior of the traffic
   and computes unusual degree of one packet on base of its deviance
   measure from normal behavior. Even then if diversion is discovered, the
   system would generate alarms indicating a series of intrusion events
   that have occurred. Despite the ability of this system to detect new
   attacks, it generates a high rate of false alarms. Shimamura and Kono
   (2006) in order to reduce false alarms rate in the signature-based IDS
   proposed a system called TrueAlarm. Although this proposed system can be
   considered as a new system of network-based intrusion detection due to
   its benefits than basic NIDS, it is important to note that TrueAlarm
   still cannot identify unknown suspicious messages as the signature-based
   NIDS, and this is its biggest weakness due to the large volume of
   network attacks in today's world that include many zero-day attacks. In
   this article whilst we want to introduce intrusion detection system as a
   powerful tool in the field of network security, and also a variety of
   analysis techniques and models, using a basic system namely TrueAlarm,
   we present a new architecture namely Integrated TrueAlarm to improve the
   false alarm problem of anomaly-based analysis model.},

Abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are composed of autonomous sensor nodes
   that cooperate among themselves to monitor scenarios in environmental,
   industrial, civilian and military applications. The wide applicability
   of such systems stimulates the growth of intelligent services to make
   living environments more comfortable and safer. Concerning security and
   surveillance issues, WSNs have been widely integrated with multi-modal
   sensors and actuators in order to actively detect any abnormal events.
   Though the sensor fusion provides accuracy and robustness, problems such
   as high costs and consumptions exist. In order to reduce the hardware
   complexity, other systems for detection and tracking of human activities
   interact with active devices worn by the targets. In this work, a
   WSN-based solution is proposed for the detection of transceiver-free
   targets exploiting only the information provided by the wireless links
   among the nodes.},

Abstract = {In those broadcast application scenarios with a great quantity of
   receivers, e.g., the data access control system in cloud storage
   service, the single sender is apt to become the efficiency bottleneck of
   the system, because the computation and storage overhead of the sender
   will grow rapidly with the amount of qualified receivers. In order to
   overcome this problem, we first introduce the novel conception of
   complete binary identity tree which is adopted to manage the qualified
   receivers. Then we design the prune-merge algorithm to further optimize
   the structure of the tree and cut down the amount of receivers. The
   algorithm effectively reduces the computation and storage cost of the
   trusted authority in the system. Subsequently, in virtue of
   composite-order bilinear groups, we bring forward an efficient public
   key broadcast encryption scheme combined its application to the system
   of data access control in cloud storage service. Compared with the
   existing schemes, the lengths of system public parameters, secret key
   and ciphertext in our scheme are all constant. In addition, the number
   of secret keys in our scheme increases logarithmically with the maximum
   amount of receivers, while the numbers of secret keys in the existing
   schemes increase linearly with the maximum amount of receivers.
   Furthermore, the proposed scheme is proved to guarantee adaptive
   security under general subgroup decision assumption in the standard
   model. The performance analysis manifests that our scheme is feasible
   for those broadcast applications with fixed senders.},

   Data Security and Privacy Protection},
Journal = {WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 3},
Abstract = {The great efficiency and dependability of cloud computing enhance the
   efficiency of mining and analyzing large data in education. Big data in
   education have been more prevalent in the cloud environment, and the
   efficiency of data processing has been greatly enhanced, elevating the
   significance of big data in education and teaching practice. However,
   the promotion of education big data in the cloud environment has
   revealed an increasing number of issues. People pay increasing attention
   to the security of big data in education, i.e., whether big data in
   education can be safely maintained, retrieved, and utilized in the cloud
   environment. It focuses on the relationships between education big data
   producers, users, and cloud service providers. The primary topics of
   this article are, therefore, how to govern the connections between the
   three parties, the adoption of stringent technical means, and the
   establishment of data use guidelines and a regulatory structure.
   Consequently, this paper investigated the multimodal information fusion
   technology and the data security model of education in colleges and
   universities, as well as constructing a cognitive psychological model
   for education in colleges and universities based on multimodal
   information fusion and conducting experimental research on it. The
   research showed that under the cognitive psychology mode of education in
   colleges and universities based on multi-modal information fusion, the
   cognitive efficiency of education of students has increased.},

Title = {Efficient dynamic threshold identity-based encryption with constant-size
   ciphertext},
Journal = {THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {609},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-59},
Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {This paper revisits the notion of dynamic threshold identity-based
   encryption, due to the recent practical interest. In this notion, an
   encryptor selects n recipients and a threshold value t for the creation
   of the ciphertext. The plaintext can only be recovered if at least t
   receivers cooperate. The key issue in this notion is its dynamicity,
   where after the users enroll to the system, the sender can dynamically
   select the set of recipients as well as dynamically set the threshold t
   upon the creation of the ciphertext. Another essential feature of this
   notion is the need for a constant-size ciphertext. Interestingly, the
   work by Delerablee and Pointcheval in Crypto 2008 is the only work that
   achieves this essential feature. In this work, we propose a new scheme
   achieving all of these nice properties with significant improvements in
   terms of the computational efficiency (both the encryption and
   decryption). In our scheme, there is no need to conduct any encryption
   and decryption using additional dummy users, which are not part of the
   recipient group, which is in contrast to Delerablee and Pointcheval's
   work. This improvement has significantly reduced the amount of
   computations required in both encryption and decryption algorithms. (C)

Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Cloud-assisted image services are widely used for various applications.
   Due to the high computational complexity of existing image encryption
   techniques, privacy protection becomes extremely challenging for
   resource constrained smart devices. We propose eCIS, a cloud-assisted
   image service where compression and encryption are jointly used for
   image processing efficiency. eCIS could shift the high computational
   cost from encoder and decoder to the cloud while providing efficient and
   adaptive image privacy protection for end users. The key idea is to
   leverage different measurement matrices for sampling device and cloud.
   Thus encryption is realized with shuffling enabled compressive sensing.
   We conduct in-depth theoretical analysis and demonstrate the
   effectiveness with evaluations. To this end, extensive experimental
   results show that eCIS can effectively protect image privacy and meet
   user's adaptive security requirements. Meanwhile, our experimental
   results show that eCIS could significantly save the system running time

Abstract = {In the attribute-based encryption (ABE) systems, users can encrypt and
   decrypt messages based on their attributes. Because of the flexibility
   of ABE, it is more and more widely used in various network environments.
   However, complex functionality of ABE may cause an enormous
   computational cost. This reason greatly restricts the application of ABE
   in practice. In order to minimize the local computation of ABE, we
   introduce the concept of verifiable outsourced ABE system, in which key
   generation center, encryptor and decryptor, are able to outsource their
   computing tasks to the corresponding service providers, respectively, to
   reduce the local load. In addition, they are also able to verify the
   correctness of outsourcing calculation efficiently by using the
   outsourcing verification services. This is useful to save local
   computational resources, especially for mobile devices. Then, we propose
   a specific verifiable outsourced ABE scheme and prove its adaptive
   security in the standard model using the dual-system encryption method.
   Finally, we introduce how to deploy our outsourced CP-ABE scheme in
   cloud computing environment.},

Abstract = {A scientific discipline which includes methods that enable
   identification of people through their behavioral or physical
   characteristics or sometimes through both is known as Biometrics.
   Enhancement of security and the increase in its demand has paved way to
   an interest in an automated method of personal authentication which is
   based on Biometrics in recent times. Owing to the availability of
   multiple factors of evidence biometric systems that are multi-modal are
   considered to be more reliable. In visual interactions among humans,
   facial recognition is one of the most commonly acceptable biometrics.
   Selection of features is a challenging task as the interaction among the
   facial features can be complex. Therefore, Particle Swarm Optimization
   (PSO) which is a feature selection based on algorithm has been proposed
   as suitable for the multi-modal biometric system which in turn can bring
   down significantly the dimension by making use of different fusion
   schemes and identifying optimal features from among them.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of technology and the proliferation of
   uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), there is an immediate need for security
   solutions. Toward this end, we propose the use of a multi-robot system
   for autonomous and cooperative counter-UAS missions. In this paper, we
   present the design of the hardware and software components of different
   complementary robotic platforms: a mobile uncrewed ground vehicle (UGV)
   equipped with a LiDAR sensor, an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) with a
   gimbal-mounted stereo camera for air-to-air inspections, and a UAV with
   a capture mechanism equipped with radars and camera. Our proposed system
   features 1) scalability to larger areas due to the distributed approach
   and online processing, 2) long-term cooperative missions, and 3)
   complementary multimodal perception for the detection of multirotor
   UAVs. In field experiments, we demonstrate the integration of all
   subsystems in accomplishing a counter-UAS task within an unstructured
   environment. The obtained results confirm the promising direction of
   using multirobot and multi-modal systems for C-UAS.},

Abstract = {Multi-modal biometric verification systems are in active development and
   show impressive performance nowadays. However, such systems need
   additional protection from spoofing attacks. In our paper we present
   full pipeline of anti-spoofing method (based on our previous work) for
   bimodal audiovisual verification system. This method allows to evaluate
   parameters of quality for a sequence of face images during a
   verification process. Based on this parameters it's decided whether the
   data is suitable for processing by the standard method (fiducial points
   based audiovisual liveness detection, FALD). If the quality of data is
   not sufficient, then our system switches to a new algorithm (svm-based
   audiovisual liveness detection, SALD), which provides less protection
   quality, but is able to operate when FALD is unsuitable. To improve the
   quality of the FALD algorithm we have collected the special dataset.
   This dataset allows to get better reliability of the algorithm for
   searching of fiducial points on the user's face image. Tests show that
   developed system can significantly improve the quality of anti-spoofing
   protection versus our previous work.},

Abstract = {Broadcast encryption is an efficient way to send the broadcast messages,
   but, it does not yield a productive way to send the personalized
   messages to individuals. A broadcast encryption with personalized
   messages (BEPM) skillfully sends the broadcast message to a group of
   users together with the personalized messages to individual users. This
   article identifies constructional flaws in the BEPM scheme of Xu et al.
   and designs three BEPM constructions, namely, BEPM-I, BEPM-II and
   BEPM-III. BEPM-I, BEPM-III are selectively secure. Unlike the existing
   similar works, these schemes eliminate the need of storing public key
   and secret key for transmitting personalized messages. We emphasize that
   BEPM-III employs multilinear maps and achieves logarithmic size public
   parameter with increasing computation cost. More positively, BEPM-II
   achieves adaptive security with the parameter size and computation cost
   as in the existing BEPM. All our constructions have constant
   communication cost and proven to be secure in the standard security
   model under reasonable assumptions in generic group model. Furthermore,
   our schemes are fully collision resistant and flexible for adding and
   removing of users from the broadcast system.},

Abstract = {Anonymous ABE is a promising primitive for enforcing fine-grained access
   control for the big data as well as preserving privacy of the users in
   Cloud Computing. However, traditional anonymous ABE schemes may not be
   secure in the real word due to the side channel attacks. In addition,
   the existing anonymous ABE schemes are considered in the leak-free
   scenario assuming that secret keys are not leaked to the adversary.
   Thus, it is compelling to study the anonymity of ABE schemes in the
   context of key leakage attacks. Aiming at tackling the challenge above,
   an anonymous CP-ABE scheme against side channel attacks in the
   bounded-leakage model is constructed. As a main technique tool, the dual
   system encryption technique is adopted. The proposed scheme uses LSSS as
   access structures and achieves adaptive security in the standard model.
   In addition, the results in simulation experiments indicate that the
   proposed scheme is efficient and practical.},

Title = {Specification and adaptive verification of access control policy for
   cyber-physical-social spaces},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {114},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cyber-Physical-Social Space (CPSS) is a promising paradigm to provide
   people with an intelligent environment by emphasizing the deep fusion of
   cyberspace, physical space, and social space. The interdependence of
   these spaces makes that CPSS is more likely to be attacked. The attack
   consequences may directly affect the state of the physical world and
   even endanger the people's life. Thus, the most challenging issue for
   CPSS is to ensure the space security. However, existing security
   analysis methods focus on the static analysis at the design phase. They
   do not consider the open and dynamic characteristics which are the core
   features of CPSS. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security
   analysis framework for CPSS to prevent the unauthorized flow of
   information. Firstly, the access control model of CPSS is proposed. It
   controls the access behaviors by considering the space information
   covering the social, cyber, and physical spaces. Secondly, Labelled
   Transition System (LTS) is established to describe the future evolutions
   of CPSS. The space states in the LTS which violate the security
   requirements are reasoned by the model checking technology. Thirdly, a
   policy adjustment method is proposed to prevent the system from entering
   the violated states or mitigate the bad results caused by the
   violations. In the end, the effectiveness of our approach is evaluated
   by a smart building case, and the necessity of our approach is analyzed
   by the performance evaluation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Real-time tracking of electromechanical oscillations in ENTSO-e

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},

Abstract = {Small signal stability is a crucial aspect of accurately keeping control
   in modern interconnected power systems, in order to ensure the required
   security and reliability standards. Such an aspect could represent a
   serious limiting factor in the search for ever higher power system
   exploitation levels. Hence, in order to exploit the existing networks as
   much as possible, ensuring at the same time adequate security levels,
   the system operators must monitor the electromechanical oscillations
   continuously, estimating their fundamental parameters (e.g. frequency,
   damping factor/ratio, amplitude and phase), and determining the actual
   dynamic stability margins. Nowadays, electromechanical oscillations
   tracking can be performed in real time thanks to the quick development
   of wide area measurement/monitoring systems, and the employment of
   so-called measurement-based methods (a.k.a. mode meters). In this
   regard, the paper presents a performance comparison among several
   measurement-based methods currently operating on the Italian Wide Area
   Monitoring (WAM) platform. The main objective of this investigation is
   to analyze the behavior of each of them with respect to actual
   critical/not critical electromechanical oscillations recorded on the
   European Network Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-e)
   Continental Synchronous European System (CESA). The considered case
   studies cover a large variety of situations that can be encountered in
   the ordinary ENTSO-e CESA operation: local and inter-area oscillations;
   single mode and multi-mode power signals; ambient and ringdown data; and
   so on. By keeping in mind that usually no best estimator exists, owing
   to the lack of an optimality definition, the present analysis aims at
   examining whether some algorithms are generally more suitable than
   others, with respect to the variety of aforementioned situations. In
   detail, the measurement-based methods considered in this work are the
   Tufts-Kumaresan method, Hankel Singular Value Decomposition-VarPRO,
   Hilbert-Huang Transform, its refined Empirical Mode Decomposition with
   Fourier-Based Masking Technique (R-EMD), and a recently published
   Hilbert Transform-based estimation algorithm. Obviously, this set of
   estimation techniques cannot be considered exhaustive for the research
   problem under analysis. Nonetheless, it represents a collection of the
   major, recent and most fashionable methodologies implemented in actual
   WAM architectures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Deniable encryption (Canetti et al. CRYPTO `97) is an intriguing
   primitive that provides a security guarantee against not only
   eavesdropping attacks as required by semantic security, but also
   stronger coercion attacks performed after the fact. The concept of
   deniability has later demonstrated useful and powerful in many other
   contexts, such as leakage resilience, adaptive security of protocols,
   and security against selective opening attacks. Despite its conceptual
   usefulness, our understanding of how to construct deniable primitives
   under standard assumptions is restricted.
   In particular from standard lattice assumptions, i.e. Learning with
   Errors (LWE), we have only flexibly and non-negligible advantage
   deniable public-key encryption schemes, whereas with the much stronger
   assumption of indistinguishable obfuscation, we can obtain at least
   fully sender-deniable PKE and computation. How to achieve deniability
   for other more advanced encryption schemes under standard assumptions
   remains an interesting open question.
   In this work, we construct a flexibly bi-deniable Attribute-Based
   Encryption (ABE) scheme for all polynomial-size Branching Programs from
   LWE. Our techniques involve new ways of manipulating Gaussian noise that
   may be of independent interest, and lead to a significantly sharper
   analysis of noise growth in Dual Regev type encryption schemes. We hope
   these ideas give insight into achieving deniability and related
   properties for further, advanced cryptographic systems from lattice
   assumptions.},

   Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {63214-63224},
Abstract = {Cybersecurity named entity recognition is an important part of threat
   information extraction from large-scale unstructured text collection in
   many cybersecurity applications. Most existing security entity
   recognition studies and systems use regular matching strategy or machine
   learning algorithms. Due to the peculiarity and complexity of security
   named entity, these models ignore the characteristic of security data
   and the correlation of entities. Therefore, through the in-depth study
   of security entity characteristic, we propose a novel security named
   entity recognition model based on regular expressions and known-entity
   dictionary as well as conditional random fields (CRF) combined with four
   feature templates. This model is named RDF-CRF. The rule-based
   expressions can match security entities with good accuracy in simpler
   situations, the known-entity dictionary can extract common and specific
   security entity, and the CRF-based extractor leverages the identified
   entities by rule-based and dictionary-based extractors to further
   improve the recognition performance. In order to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our proposed model, extensive experiments are performed
   on a security text dataset collected from public security webs. The
   experimental results show that can achieve better performance than
   state-of-the-art methods.},

Abstract = {The Internet connects hundreds of millions of computers across the world
   running on multiple hardware and software platforms providing
   communication and commercial services. However, this interconnectivity
   among computers also enables malicious users to misuse resources and
   mount Internet attacks. The continuously growing Internet attacks pose
   severe challenges to develop a flexible, adaptive security oriented
   methods. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of most important
   component being used to detect the Internet attacks. In literature,
   different techniques from various disciplines have been utilized to
   develop efficient IDS. Artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques
   plays prominent role in development of IDS and has many benefits over
   other techniques. However, there is no comprehensive review of AI based
   techniques to examine and understand the current status of these
   techniques to solve the intrusion detection problems. In this paper,
   various AI based techniques have been reviewed focusing on development
   of IDS. Related studies have been compared by their source of audit
   data, processing criteria, technique used, dataset, classifier design,
   feature reduction technique employed and other experimental environment
   setup. Benefits and limitations of AI based techniques have been
   discussed. The paper will help the better understanding of different
   directions in which research has been done in the field of IDS. The
   findings of this paper provide useful insights into literature and are
   beneficial for those who are interested in applications of AI based
   techniques to IDS and related fields. The review also provides the
   future directions of the research in this area.},

Abstract = {Several broadcast encryption (BE) constructions have been proposed since
   Fiat and Naor introduced the concept, some achieving short parameters
   size while others achieve better security. Since 1994, a lot of
   alternatives to BE have moreover been additionally proposed, such as the
   broadcast and trace (BT) primitive which is a combination of broadcast
   encryption and traitor tracing. Among the other variants of BE, the
   notion of augmented BE (AugBE), introduced by Boneh and Waters in 2006,
   corresponds to a BE scheme with the particularity that the encryption
   algorithm takes an index as an additional parameter. If an AugBE scheme
   is both message and index hiding, it has been proved that it can
   generically be used to construct a secure BT scheme. Hence, any new
   result related to the former gives an improvement to the latter. In this
   paper, we first show that both BE and AugBE can be obtained by using an
   identity-based encryption scheme with wildcard (WIBE). We also introduce
   the new notion of anonymous AugBE, where the used users set is hidden,
   and prove that it implies index hiding. We then provide two different
   WIBE constructions. The first one has constant size ciphertext and used
   to construct a new constant size ciphertext BE scheme with adaptive CPA
   security, in the standard model (under the SXDH assumption). The second
   WIBE provides pattern-hiding, a new definition we introduced, and serves
   as a basis for the first anonymous AugBE scheme (and subsequently a BT
   scheme since our scheme is also index hiding by nature) in the
   literature, with adaptive security in the standard model (under the
   XDLin assumption).},

Abstract = {Muti-modal biometric recognition systems have attracted the attention of
   many researchers in today's modern world. These systems have greater
   advantages over traditional systems that are difficult to break and
   provide good anti-spoofing abilities. Use of these systems has increased
   in recent years owing to the increasing trend of thefts, breaking of
   security systems, hacking and another means of unauthorized access. In
   this paper a multimodal recognition algorithm using palm print and palm
   vein images. The palm print image is rich in line features as it
   consists of wrinkles, ridges and principal lines. On the other hand the
   palm vein image contains rich texture features in the form of blood
   vessel patterns also called as vein patterns. A multimodal
   identification system has been proposed in this paper which uses
   Contourlet transform to analyze the features present in palm print and
   palm vein images. The proposed algorithm captures local minutae and a
   global feature from a palm print and palm vein images and stores them as
   a compact code. After extraction of the ROI from the source images the
   (2-D) image spectrum is divided into fine sub-components (called
   subbands) using iterated directional filter bank structure. The feature
   matching technique is then performed using Euclidean Distance algorithm.
   For this algorithm CASIA Palm print Database V1.0 is used.},

Abstract = {Biometrics is an emerging technology in this era, which has been widely
   used in many application such as secured access to a computer and any
   other system, criminal identification, person authentication, etc. Face
   recognition is a biometric method of identifying a person by comparing
   the data with the stored information of that person. But the recognition
   of face can be affected by illumination variation, facial expression and
   other issues. Therefore, the authentication using only face image might
   be difficult for the system. To overcome this challenge, biometric
   authentications have to rely on more than one method. In this paper, we
   consider audio-video person authentication based on two sources of
   information. Single modality evidence has limitations in both security
   and robustness. Therefore, here, audio recognition is added with visual
   recognition. Facial features, as well as speech is extracted separately
   from audiovisual data and integrate both the modality for secure user
   authentication. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is used as
   the speech feature. Viola-Jones and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform
   (SIFT) algorithm are used for visual feature extraction. After the
   extraction of audio and visual features, the feature selection method is
   employed. The two-phase algorithm consisting of statistical analysis,
   Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) is
   proposed to select significant features from audio-visual data. The
   Audio and Video processing is done in two separate phases using machine
   learning algorithms. The results of both the modalities are then
   combined at the decision level based on majority voting. It has been
   observed that multiple modalities of both audio-visual information give
   immensely good results compared to a standalone single modality.},

Abstract = {Dynamic searchable encryption methods allow a client to perform searches
   and updates over encrypted data stored in the cloud. Recent schemes
   enable secure searching over an encrypted database stored in a server,
   but these schemes only focus on hiding the access pattern using ORAM.
   Although the traditional Oblivious Random Access Machine ( ORAM) can
   hide the access pattern, which refers to the set of documents that match
   the client's queries, it also incurs significant communication overhead
   and cannot hide the search pattern. Existing researches show that the
   general dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE) scheme is
   vulnerable to statistical attacks due to the leakage of both search
   patterns and access patterns. Therefore hiding the access pattern is not
   enough, it is essential to hide both access patterns and search patterns
   with high efficiency. To overcome this limitation, a DSSE scheme called
   obliviously shuffled incidence matrix DSSE (OSM-DSSE) is proposed in
   this paper to access the encrypted data obliviously without using ORAM.
   The OSM- DSSE scheme realizes efficient search and update operations
   based on an incidence matrix. In particular, a shuffling algorithm using
   Paillier encryption combines the 1- out-of-n obliviously transfer (OT)
   protocol to hide access pattern and an optimized padding scheme to
   obfuscate the search pattern with low storage overhead. Besides,
   Simulation results and security analysis confirm that OSMDSSE scheme
   achieves high security and efficient searches. Also, this scheme
   provides adaptive security against malicious attacks by adversaries.
   Furthermore, OSM-DSSE is capable of searching for a keyword out of 9 x
   1010 keyword-file pairs within 2.19 s which is 3-4 x better execution
   efficiency than the state-of-art solutions.},

Abstract = {In cloud computing, computationally weak users are always willing to
   outsource costly computations to a cloud, and at the same time they need
   to check the correctness of the result provided by the cloud. Such
   activities motivate the occurrence of verifiable computation (VC).
   Recently, Parno, Raykova and Vaikuntanathan showed any VC protocol can
   be constructed from an attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme for a
   same class of functions. In this paper, we propose two practical and
   efficient semi-adaptively secure key-policy attribute-based encryption
   (KP-ABE) schemes with constant-size ciphertexts. The semi-adaptive
   security requires that the adversary designates the challenge attribute
   set after it receives public parameters but before it issues any secret
   key query, which is stronger than selective security guarantee.
   Our first construction deals with small universe while the second one
   supports large universe. Both constructions employ the technique
   underlying the prime-order instantiation of nested dual system groups,
   which are based on the d-linear assumption including SXDH and DLIN
   assumptions. In order to evaluate the performance, we implement our ABE
   schemes using Python language in Charm. Compared with previous (KP-ABE)
   schemes with constant-size ciphertexts, our constructions achieve
   shorter ciphertext and secret key sizes, and require low computation
   costs, especially under the SXDH assumption.},

Abstract = {X-ray multi-energy adaptive security radiography and computed tomography
   inspection techniques have superior performance compared to conventional
   dual-energy methods where two image slices are acquired by alternating
   energies. This new technique allows improving the quality of
   radiographic and CT images, expanding the range of areal densities of
   the interrogated objects over which effective discrimination of
   materials by atomic number is possible, eliminating artifacts in the
   image of boundaries of different densities, and reducing the time of
   inspection and the required dose. For this new inspection technology,
   RadiaBeam Technologies is developing several new types of x-ray sources
   that are based on linear electron accelerators. To provide an adaptive
   mode of operation of inspection systems, such accelerators use fast
   feedback from the detector array. Depending on the application, the
   range of the electron energy can vary from 180 keV up to 9 MeV. In this
   paper, we discuss the requirements for such linear accelerators, some
   details about their designs, and present the results of high-power and
   beam testing of the S- and X-band accelerators.},

Title = {Identity-based outsider anonymous cloud data outsourcing with
   simultaneous individual transmission for IoT environment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {60},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing has
   become an attractive cloud-oriented big data processing paradigm, which
   is playing an important role in efficiency and productivity for
   digitalization of numerous IoT enabled industries. However,
   cloud-assisted IoT is also becoming an increasingly attractive target
   for various cyber-attacks, including the authenticity of outsourcing
   data, untrustworthiness of third parties, and data security and privacy.
   As a potential and promising solution to securely outsource data, we
   present the first construction for an efficient cloud data outsourcing
   system with simultaneous individual transmission preserving outsider
   anonymity of the subscribed consumer set. In our system, a data owner
   generates personalized data for each of the consumers in a group and
   transmits a common encrypted data for the group in such a way that the
   subscribed consumer set is completely hidden from the outsiders.
   Personalized data can be recovered only by an authorized consumer, while
   the common data can be decrypted by all the authorized consumer in that
   group. The communication bandwidth is compact in our construction, and
   the decryption algorithm requires significantly less computation cost.
   We design our scheme using asymmetric bilinear map over the prime order
   group to prevent fault attacks on symmetric bilinear map. Our
   construction is built in identity based setting without any non-standard
   q -type security assumption and does not use random oracles. Our scheme
   enjoys adaptive security against an indistinguishable chosen-plaintext
   attack under the hardness of the standard decisional bilinear
   Diffie-Hellman exponent problem. Furthermore, our design supports an
   exponential number of consumers as the size of the valid identity set
   grows exponentially with the security parameter, whereas it is only
   polynomial in the security parameter for the existing cloud data
   outsourcing systems. In particular, the implementation and performance
   analysis explicates the advantages of our design for
   resource-constrained IoT enabled frameworks.},

Abstract = {With the expansion of smart device users, the security mechanism of
   these devices in terms of user authentication has been advanced a lot.
   These mechanisms consist of a pattern based authentication, biometric
   based authentication, etc. For security purpose whenever a user fails to
   authenticate themselves, these devices get locked. But as these devices
   consist of numerous applications (document creator, pdf viewer,
   e-banking, Social networking app, etc.), locking of the whole devices
   prevents the user from using any of the applications. Since the variety
   of applications provided by the devices have different security needs,
   we feel it is better to have application level security rather than
   device level. Here, in this paper, we have proposed a behavioral
   biometric based user authentication mechanism for application level
   security. First, we have performed a risk assessment of different
   applications. Then for complete protection, static multi-modal
   (keystroke and mouse dynamics) authentication at the start of an
   interactive session, and a continuous keystroke authentication during
   this session is performed. An analysis of the proposed authentication
   mechanism has been conducted on the basis of false acceptance rate
   (FAR), false rejection rate (FRR) and equal error rate (EER). The static
   multi-modal authentication achieved a FAR of 0.89\%, FRR of 1.2\% and
   EER of 1.04\% using J48 classification algorithm. Whereas the continuous
   keystroke authentication has been analyzed by the time (no. of
   keystrokes pressed) taken to capture an intruder.},

Abstract = {Public key broadcast encryption system is a fundamental cryptographic
   primitive that enables a broadcaster to transmit encrypted content to a
   set of users allowing only a privileged subset of users to decrypt the
   content. Traditionally, it is not possible to remove any receiver from
   the encrypted content without decryption. Recipient revocable broadcast
   encryption (RRBE) is an useful cryptographic primitive whereby a trusted
   third party can revoke a set of users from the encrypted content without
   having the ability to decrypt it. This property is not achievable in
   traditional broadcast encryption (BE) schemes. However, the currently
   existing RRBE schemes are secure only in the random oracle model. In
   this paper, we propose two new constructions for RRBE with constant
   number of pairing, linear exponentiation operations and analyze their
   security in the standard model. Our first construction achieves adaptive
   security in the standard model with constant communication cost as
   opposed to the existing adaptively secure RRBE schemes all of which use
   random oracles and have linear communication cost. The storage and
   computation complexity are linear to the total number of users and the
   number of subscribed users respectively.
   Our second construction attains selective security in the standard model
   with constant size public parameter and secret key. The communication
   and computation overhead are linear to the number of revoked users. We
   emphasize that, this scheme is flexible in a sense that constant size
   public parameter allows to encrypt any number of users in the system.
   The proposed constructions are highly comparable with the existing
   similar schemes, exhibits better performance over them and practically
   more efficient.},

Abstract = {Multi-modal biometrics enjoy more merits than their single-modal
   counterparts in terms of accuracy performance and security. The fusion
   of hand-based biometrics such as palmprint and palmvein is
   straightforward since they can be acquired simultaneously with a
   customized image acquisition device. Conjugate 2DPalmHash Code (CTDPHC),
   which is constructed by 2DPalmHash Codes (2DPHCs) of palmprint and
   palmvein, is proposed as a cancelable multi-modal biometric. To
   determine the proper fusion strategy of 2DPHCs of palmprint and
   palmvein, different fusion rules at score level are compared and
   discussed. The transposition orientation ranges of 2DPHCs are also
   fine-tuned to improve the accuracy performance. Compared with 2DPHC,
   CTDPHC enjoys higher verification accuracy and stronger anti-counterfeit
   ability, while trades neither computational complexity nor storage cost.},

Abstract = {One of the major authentication threats arises at the access entrance
   point of the cloud which leads to the need of developing a reliable
   authentication framework. Multimodal authentication systems represent an
   emerging trend for cloud information security. Multi-modal Biometric
   Frameworks (MBF) utilize more than one biometric identifier to recognize
   a person. MBF are expected to be more reliable due to the presence of
   multiple independent pieces of biometric traits. The aim of these
   multibiometric systems is to achieve a high reliability to determine or
   verify person's identity. The motivation for using fuzzy logic is that
   it offers methods best suited to model the information that is
   inherently uncertain and ambiguous. This paper implements score level
   fusion based on fuzzy logic for developing Fuzzy Rule Based (FRB) MBF.
   The matching module integrates fuzzy logic methods for matching score
   fusion. This approach is tested on the fingerprint and face score
   database of 102 people obtained from NIST BSSR1 database. The
   experimental results exhibits that the proposed method is comparable
   with the existing recognizing methods. The proposed FRB MBF results in
   enhanced security by achieving GAR of 90.2\% at FAR of 0.0029 and EER
   equal to 0.078.},

Abstract = {Foreground object recognition in video is critical in many computer
   vision applications and automated video surveillance systems. Object
   detection and tracking are critical steps in navigation, object
   recognition and surveillance schemes. Object detection is process of
   separating foreground and background items in photographs. In this
   paper, we proposes a framework for achieving these tasks with the
   enhanced cyber security control facility. This proposed
   algorithmperformed in 2 stages: multi-object detection utilizing the
   Cyber secure Probabilistic Gaussian Mixture Model (Cy\_SPGMM) and
   background suppression and another stage is multiple moving objects
   tracking utilizing Kernel convoluted moving window with Kalman filter
   (KCMW\_KF). It can, however, deal with a variety of video sequences in
   the MOT 20 dataset. The experimental findings reveal that the proposed
   algorithm detects and tracks foreground objects in complex and dynamic
   scenarios with high accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. This method
   also produces smoothened images without noise.},

Abstract = {Threshold cryptography is a fundamental distributed computational
   paradigm for enhancing the availability and the security of
   cryptographic public-key schemes. It does it by dividing private keys
   into n shares handed out to distinct servers. In threshold signature
   schemes, a set of at least t + 1 <= n servers is needed to produce a
   valid digital signature. Availability is assured by the fact that any
   subset of t + 1 servers can produce a signature when authorized. At the
   same time, the scheme should remain robust (in the fault tolerance
   sense) and unforgeable (cryptographically) against up to t corrupted
   servers; i.e., it adds quorum control to traditional cryptographic
   services and introduces redundancy. Originally, most practical threshold
   signatures have a number of demerits: They have been analyzed in a
   static corruption model (where the set of corrupted servers is fixed at
   the very beginning of the attack), they require interaction, they assume
   a trusted dealer in the key generation phase (so that the system is not
   fully distributed), or they suffer from certain overheads in terms of
   storage (large share sizes). In this paper, we construct practical fully
   distributed (the private key is born distributed), non-interactive
   schemes -where the servers can compute their partial signatures without
   communication with other servers- with adaptive security (i.e., the
   adversary corrupts servers dynamically based on its full view of the
   history of the system). Our schemes are very efficient in terms of
   computation, communication, and scalable storage (with private key
   shares of size O(1), where certain solutions incur O(n) storage costs at
   each server). Unlike other adaptively secure schemes, our schemes are
   erasure-free (reliable erasure is a hard to assure and hard to
   administer property in actual systems). To the best of our knowledge,
   such a fully distributed highly constrained scheme has been an open
   problem in the area. In particular, and of special interest, is the fact
   that Pedersen's traditional distributed key generation (DKG) protocol
   can be safely employed in the initial key generation phase when the
   system is born - although it is well-known not to ensure uniformly
   distributed public keys. An advantage of this is that this protocol only
   takes one round optimistically (in the absence of faulty player).},

Abstract = {In recent times, security threats are predominant in almost all digital
   applications over the internet. One such threatening effect comes from
   GAMEOVER Zeus Botnet. These Botnets enter inside online networks and
   affect the Peer client list, through Internet Rely Chat (IRC). IRC
   includes applications like Tactical chat and On Chat. Zeus botnets
   gather the secret information of these users, such as bank data and
   military secrets. Moreover, the architecture is P2P and hence the
   location of GAMEOVER Zeus Botnet varies from the one to another botnets
   models. The threat of Zeus botnets loom large as they operate through
   the processes of identification of users, through which, they establish
   control over the hosts via P2P server. An intelligent method of
   identification of Zeus botnets in a distributed computing system using
   cryptographic schemes to defend against such attacks is the prime issue
   of research in this paper. An advanced Botnet capturing algorithm, named
   as modified cryptographic prefix IP anonymize (CPA) algorithm is
   proposed in this research paper to effectively counter the threats of
   Zeus bots. Essential features of the proposed CPA algorithm include
   prefixed IP mapped anonymizing in Internet Rely Chat, inbuilt adaptive
   security algorithm, which helps in network cleansing. If left unchecked,
   these Zeus botnets may result in consequent shutdown of the system.
   Hence, identification of the location of these botnets with the help of
   IP-prefix mapped method through modified CPA algorithm have been
   systematically presented in this paper.},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) have very big opportunities in businesses and
   life, especially Internet Banking, Healthcare and Transportation. But
   developers face challenges in security especially for sensitive data to
   use IoT safely with Internet Banking. In this paper, a secure IoT
   connection between clients and broker server based on iris recognition
   system (Authentication server) will be proposed. The proposed iris
   recognition system will communicate with MQTT broker server to increase
   authentication instead of using normal text method (username/password).
   The proposed authentication server in this paper is to use iris as
   uni-modal biometric trait, by applying different scenarios of
   multi-biometrics other than the multi-modal, to develop and implement
   iris-based recognition system. In feature extraction phase, the fusion
   between vectors of Delta-Mean (DM) and Multi-Algorithm-Mean (MAM)
   executed in a parallel mode. Then, followed by the proposed reduction
   method, reduced the feature vector size keeping higher performance.
   Finally, classification is adopted by using Euclidian Distance (ED)
   classifier. It is suitable for secure MQTT connection message to
   authenticate right client in sensitive application like bank transfer
   operations.},

Abstract = {Whether it is for hunting prey, or modern racing, games, or war, how to
   accurately track the target is the key to the victory. When we can have
   a machine to help us track the target, we can naturally solve more
   problems. Not only it can be used in military applications, such as
   warplane radar and missiles but it can be applied in civilian purposes
   including home security, event broadcasting, smart home. The target
   tracking is becoming increasingly mature. In this paper, we aim to
   develop a practical three-axis target tracking system by simulating the
   hunting ability of snakes in nature, and we add thermal infrared images
   to increase the model modality and optimize the ability of existing
   Siamese tracking network Multi-Modal Machine Learning (MMML) is modified
   with the Siamese tracking network into a multi-modal fusion model, so as
   to improve the model's perception. At the same time, the Siamese
   networks models for training normal images and thermal infrared images
   are separated and a pseudo-Siamese network is used as the main framework
   to process the different the databases. This paper successfully improves
   the stability and accuracy of the model. With the embedded development
   version and three-axis servo motor, our system can be more flexible in
   tracking applications.},

Abstract = {Template security is a vital concern in biometric systems because unlike
   passwords, stolen biometric templates cannot be revoked and hence,
   fool-proof techniques are required to securely store the multi-biometric
   templates. The existing technique uses hand vein and palm vein
   modalities in building a fuzzy vault for multi-biometric recognition.
   But, security involved in converting the feature points to vault is not
   much impressive. In order to build effective security measure in fuzzy
   vault generation, we have to utilize a method of dual cryptography
   techniques that make use of AES and DES cryptography. Here, we use two
   types of algorithm, namely AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES
   (Data Encryption Standard) that all are symmetric cryptographic
   techniques. Initially, feature points from palm and hand veins are
   encrypted using AES algorithm. Then, the private key generated by AES
   algorithm is given to DES algorithm for encryption. Finally, the
   multi-modal biometric template and the secret key are used to generate
   the fuzzy vault. For decryption, the public key of DES is used to
   decrypt the private key of AES algorithm. Then, the encrypted feature
   points are decrypted by the AES algorithm. The performance is analyzed
   with the help of evaluation metrics. The results are also compared to
   our earlier technique and the results shows that the proposed technique
   has achieved better results having GAR of 90\% without noise and with
   noise. The technique yielded good security for modality based biometric
   recognition.},

Title = {Data Fusion for Intelligent Crowd Monitoring and Management Systems: A
   Survey},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {47069-47083},
Abstract = {Intelligent Crowd Monitoring and Management Systems (ICMMSs) have become
   effective resources for strengthening safety and security along with
   enhancing early-warning capabilities to manage emergencies in crowded
   situations of smart cities and massive gatherings events. The main
   advantage of such systems is their ability to detect multiple features
   associated with the crowd gathering, as they enable multi-source
   sensors, multi-modal data, and powerful intelligent and analytical
   methods. Unlike traditional crowd monitoring systems, which make use of
   simplex forms of different data types, data and information associated
   with crowded scenarios can be collected, fused, processed and analyzed
   in large quantities for accurate global assessment and enhanced decision
   making processes in an ICMMS. Therefore, data fusion is introduced as an
   enabler to decrease data quantity, reduce data dimensions, and improve
   data quality. In this paper, we first survey the literature on data
   fusion application in crowd monitoring systems as we are developing a
   state-of-the-art ICMMS with data fusion as a major platform enabler.
   Next, we discuss some popular data fusion architectures and
   classifications from different perspectives. Based on this, we propose a
   multi-sensor, multi-modal, and dimensional ICMMS architecture based on
   data fusion. Then, we identify the data fusion processes in the ICMMS
   and classify them into sensor fusion, feature-based data fusion, and
   decision fusion. Relevant algorithms, applications and examples of three
   classes are elaborated. Finally, future data fusion research directions
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {Design of a serial fusion based multi-biometric verification system
   requires fixing several parameters, such as reject thresholds at each
   stage of the architecture and the order in which each individual
   verifier is placed within the multi-stage system. Selecting the order of
   verifier is a crucial parameter to fix because of its high impact on
   verification errors. A wrong choice of verifier order might lead to
   tremendous user inconvenience by denying a large number of genuine users
   and might cause severe security breach by accepting impostors
   frequently. Unfortunately, this design issue has been poorly
   investigated in multi-biometric literature. In this paper, we address
   this design issue by performing experiments using three different serial
   fusion based multi-biometric verification schemes. We did our
   experiments on publicly available NIST multi-modal dataset. We tested 24
   orders-all possible orders originated from four individual verifiers-on
   a four-stage biometric verification system. Our experimental results
   show that the verifier order ``best-to-worst{''}, where the best
   performing individual verifier is placed in the first stage, the next
   best performing individual verifier is placed in the second stage, and
   so on, is the top performing order. In addition, we have proposed a
   modification to the traditional architecture of serial fusion based
   multi-biometric verification systems. With rigorous experiments on the
   NIST multi-modal dataset and using three serial fusion based
   multi-biometric verification schemes, we demonstrated that our proposed
   architecture significantly improves the performance of serial fusion
   based multi-biometric verification systems.},

Abstract = {In 2007 and 2008 ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana/Italian Space Agency)
   launched three out of four X-band SAR satellites of the COSMO-SkyMed
   (COnstellation of small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation)
   constellation, making available to the users a unique SAR constellation
   dedicated to the Earth Observation.
   The constellation will be completed with the launch of the fourth
   satellite in 2010.
   COSMO-SkyMed is the largest Italian investment in Space Systems for
   Earth Observation, commissioned and funded by Italian Space Agency (ASI)
   and Italian Ministry of Defense (MoD). COSMO-SkyMed is a Dual-Use
   (Civilian and Defence) end-to-end Earth Observation System aimed to
   establish a global service supplying provision of data, products and
   services relevant to a wide range of applications, such as Risk
   Management, Scientific and Commercial Applications and
   Defence/Intelligence Applications.
   The system consists of a constellation of four Low Earth Orbit mid-sized
   satellites, each equipped with a multi-mode high-resolution Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (SAR) operating at X-band. The system is completed by
   dedicated full featured Ground infrastructures for managing the
   constellation and granting ad-hoc services for collection, archiving and
   distribution of acquired remote sensing data.
   The first and second COSMO-SkyMed satellites are in the operational
   phase while the third one is completing its commissioning phase.
   The results coming from the utilisation of the two first satellites,
   after the first year of life, revealing an excellent performance of the
   X-band SAR and the importance of a fast response time in several
   application as risk and emergency management (i.e., China's earthquake,
   Myanmar and Haiti flood), ice monitoring (reduction of the glaciers,
   Wilkins Ice Shelf disintegration), multi-temporal acquisition for
   agriculture monitoring, ship detection, interferometry, landslides
   monitoring, maritime surveillance and security, rapid mapping.
   A further step forward will be realized when COSMO-SkyMed 3 will be
   operative, since the third satellite is positioned in the so-called
   ``one-day interferometry configuration{''}, it will allow the
   constellation to detect interferometric acquisitions with a
   de-correlation time equal to one day.
   The first COSMO-SkyMed Announcement of Opportunity for scientific data
   exploitation will give the chance to achieve innovative and valuable
   results using the COSMO-SkyMed data, products and services.},

Title = {PDE based scheme for multi-modal medical image watermarking},
Journal = {BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Background: This work deals with copyright protection of digital images,
   an issue that needs protection of intellectual property rights. It is an
   important issue with a large number of medical images interchanged on
   the Internet every day. So, it is a challenging task to ensure the
   integrity of received images as well as authenticity. Digital
   watermarking techniques have been proposed as valid solution for this
   problem.
   Methods: It is worth mentioning that the Region Of Interest (ROI)/Region
   Of Non Interest (RONI) selection can be seen as a significant limitation
   from which suffers most of ROI/RONI based watermarking schemes and that
   in turn affects and limit their applicability in an effective way.
   Generally, the ROI/RONI is defined by a radiologist or a computer-aided
   selection tool. And thus, this will not be efficient for an institute or
   health care system, where one has to process a large number of images.
   Therefore, developing an automatic ROI/RONI selection is a challenge
   task. The major aim of this work is to develop an automatic selection
   algorithm of embedding region based on the so called Partial
   Differential Equation (PDE) method. Thus avoiding ROI/RONI selection
   problems including: (1) computational overhead, (2) time consuming, and
   (3) modality dependent selection.
   Results: The algorithm is evaluated in terms of imperceptibility,
   robustness, tamper localization and recovery using MRI, Ultrasound, CT
   and X-ray grey scale medical images. From experimental results that we
   have conducted on a database of 100 medical images of four modalities,
   it can be inferred that our method can achieve high imperceptibility,
   while showing good robustness against attacks. Furthermore, the
   experiment results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
   in detecting and recovering the various types of tampering. The highest
   PSNR value reached over the 100 images is 94,746 dB, while the lowest
   PSNR value is 60,1272 dB, which demonstrates the higher imperceptibility
   nature of the proposed method. Moreover, the Normalized Correlation (NC)
   between the original watermark and the corresponding extracted watermark
   for 100 images is computed. We get a NC value greater than or equal to
   0.998. This indicates that the extracted watermark is very similar to
   the original watermark for all modalities.
   Conclusion: The key features of our proposed method are to (1) increase
   the robustness of the watermark against attacks; (2) provide more
   transparency to the embedded watermark. (3) provide more authenticity
   and integrity protection of the content of medical images. (4) provide
   minimum ROI/RONI selection complexity.},

Title = {Born and raised distributively: Fully distributed non-interactive
   adaptively-secure threshold signatures with short shares},
Journal = {THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {645},
Pages = {1-24},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Threshold cryptography is a fundamental distributed computational
   paradigm for enhancing the availability and the security of
   cryptographic public-key schemes. It does it by dividing private keys
   into n shares handed out to distinct servers. In threshold signature
   schemes, a set of at least t + 1 <= n servers is needed to produce a
   valid digital signature. Availability is assured by the fact that any
   subset of t + 1 servers can produce a signature when authorized. At the
   same time, the scheme should remain robust (in the fault tolerance
   sense) and unforgeable (cryptographically) against up to t corrupted
   servers; i.e., it adds quorum control to traditional cryptographic
   services and introduces redundancy. Originally, most practical threshold
   signatures have a number of demerits: They have been analyzed in a
   static corruption model (where the set of corrupted servers is fixed at
   the very beginning of the attack); they require interaction; they assume
   a trusted dealer in the key generation phase (so that the system is not
   fully distributed); or they suffer from certain overheads in terms of
   storage (large share sizes).
   In this paper, we construct practical fully distributed (the private key
   is born distributed), non-interactive schemes where the servers can
   compute their partial signatures without communication with other
   servers with adaptive security (i.e., the adversary corrupts servers
   dynamically based on its full view of the history of the system). Our
   schemes are very efficient in terms of computation, communication, and
   scalable storage (with private key shares of size 0(1), where certain
   solutions incur 0(n) storage costs at each server). Unlike other
   adaptively secure schemes, our schemes are erasure-free (reliable
   erasure is hard to assure and hard to administer properly in actual
   systems). To the best of our knowledge, such a fully distributed highly
   constrained scheme has been an open problem in the area. In particular,
   and of special interest, is the fact that Pedersen's traditional
   distributed key generation (DKG) protocol can be safely employed in the
   initial key generation phase when the system is born although it is
   well-known not to ensure uniformly distributed public keys. An advantage
   of this is that this protocol only takes one round optimistically (in
   the absence of faulty player). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Efficient subtree-based encryption for fuzzy-entity data sharing},
Journal = {SOFT COMPUTING},

Abstract = {Cloud storage brings strong conveniences for flexible data sharing. When
   sharing data with a large number of entities described with fuzzy
   identities, the data owners must leverage a suitable encryption scheme
   to meet the security and efficiency requirements. (hierarchical)
   Identity-based encryption is a promising candidate to ensure
   fuzzy-entity data sharing while meeting the security requirement, but
   encounters the efficiency difficulty in multireceiver settings. We
   introduce the notion of subtree-based encryption (SBE) to support
   multireceiver data sharing mechanism in large-scale enterprises. Users
   in SBE are organized in a tree structure. Superior users can generate
   the secret keys to their subordinates. Unlike HIBE merely allowing a
   single decryption path, SBE enables encryption for a subset of users. We
   define the security notion for SBE, namely Ciphertext
   Indistinguishability against Adaptively Chosen-Sub-Tree and
   Chosen-Ciphertext Attack (IND-CST-CCA2). We propose two secure SBE
   schemes (SBEs). We first propose a basic SBEs against Adaptively
   Chosen-Sub-Tree and Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-CST-CPA), in which we
   do not allow the attacker to get decryption results from other users in
   the security game. We then propose a CCA2-secure SBEs from the basic
   scheme without requiring any other cryptographic primitives. Our
   CCA2-secure scheme natively allows public ciphertext validity test,
   which is a useful property when a CCA2-secure SBEs is used to design
   advanced protocols and auditing mechanisms for fuzzy-entity data
   sharing.},

   Multi-TF Images of ECG and EMG},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {159},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As security is emphasized inside and outside the vehicle, research on
   driver identification technology using bio-signals is being actively
   studied. The bio-signals acquired by the behavioral characteristics of
   the driver include artifacts generated according to the driving
   environment, which could potentially degrade the accuracy of the
   identification system. Existing driver identification systems either
   remove the normalization process of bio-signals in the preprocessing
   stage or use artifacts included in a single bio-signals, resulting in
   low identification accuracy. To solve these problems in a real
   situation, we propose a driver identification system that converts ECG
   and EMG signals obtained from different driving conditions into 2D
   spectrograms through multi-TF image and uses multi-stream CNN. The
   proposed system consists of a preprocessing phase of ECG and EMG
   signals, a multi-TF image conversion process, and a driver
   identification stage using a multi-stream-based CNN. Under all driving
   conditions, the driver identification system reached an average accuracy
   of 96.8\% and an F1 score of 0.973, which overperformed the existing
   driver identification systems by more than 1\%.},

Abstract = {A layered management and hybrid control strategy based on hybrid
   automata and random forest for the microgrid is proposed in this study.
   It is used to realise energy management and multi-modal coordinated
   switching of microgrid system to ensure high security, stability and
   high efficiency. Management and control strategies are implemented
   through a three-layer microgrid architecture based on multi-agent system
   theory. An energy management strategy is designed for the microgrid
   system in the upper layer agent structure. A coordinated control
   strategy is designed in the middle layer agent structure. A local
   control strategy is designed into the bottom layer agent structure. In
   the middle layer coordinated control strategy, the hybrid automata is

Abstract = {The notion of smooth projective hash functions was proposed by Cramer
   and Shoup and can be seen as special type of zero-knowledge proof system
   for a language. Though originally used as a means to build efficient
   chosen-ciphertext secure public-key encryption schemes; some variations
   of the Crainer-Shoup smooth projective hash functions also found
   applications in several other contexts, such as password-based
   authenticated key exchange and oblivious transfer. In this paper, we
   first; address the problem of building smooth projective hash functions
   for more complex languages. Adore precisely, we show how to build such
   functions for languages that can be described in terms of disfunctions
   and conjunctions of simpler languages for which smooth projective hash
   functions are known to exist. Next, we illustrate how the use of smooth
   projective hash functions with more complex languages can be efficiently
   associated to extractable commitment schemes and avoid the need for
   zero-knowledge proofs. Finally, we explain flow to apply these results
   to provide more efficient solutions to two well-known cryptographic
   problems: a public-key certification which guarantees the knowledge of
   the private key by the user without random oracles or zero-knowledge
   proofs and adaptive security for password-based authenticated key
   exchange protocols in the universal composability framework with
   erasures.},

Abstract = {The first IFIP/IEEE international workshop on Managing Federations and
   Cooperative Management (ManFed.CoM) took place in conjunction with the
   IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM
   2011) conference in Trinity College Dublin, Ireland on May 23rd 2011.
   The multi-mode, loosely coupled, user-centric nature of modern
   communications and services, coupled with the diversity of operator
   business models, ensure that modern end-to-end service provision
   frequently crosses heterogeneous management and administrative domains.
   Thus, management approaches that can be applied across organizational
   boundaries are increasingly important in a wide range of application
   areas. There are a number of significant, common, complex issues which
   must be addressed in all technologies and applications that involve
   federated organizations, yet research has heretofore been mostly
   confined to particular technical or application areas. The first
   installment of ManFed.Com addressed this gap by bringing together
   researchers from a broad array of application and technical areas who
   shared an interest in cross-domain management. The workshop drew out
   common themes, problems and issues encountered, and the solutions being
   designed to deal with the problems of managing information systems that
   span autonomous domains. More than 30 researchers participated in a
   lively and interactive day of paper presentation, panels and software
   demonstrations. The success of the inaugural event was such that the
   organizing committee is now committed to running further
   installations-we are in the process of preparing a submission to run a
   the 2nd ManFed.CoM in conjunction with the IEEE/IFIP Network Operations
   and Management Symposium (NOMS) 2012 conference. We believe that these
   workshops will help to provide the basis for a common understanding and
   common approaches to inter-domain management and governance that
   synthesizes the insights and best-of-breed solutions being developed in
   the diverse areas in which these problems are encountered. The technical
   program of ManFed.CoM 2011 was organized as a single track and was
   composed of two panels of invited experts, two full paper sessions, one
   short paper session and a demonstration session in which practical
   software tools were presented. Of the 16 papers submitted, 6 were
   selected for presentation as full papers, with a further 3 being
   presented in condensed form as short papers. All the papers submitted
   underwent a rigorous review process, receiving between 2 and 5 reviews
   each, with the accepted full papers receiving a minimum score of 7.5 out
   of 10 from reviewers. The papers presented constituted a good
   cross-section of current cross-domain management research work-they
   covered modeling, semantic interoperability, trust management and
   security, policy based management, business process orchestration,
   collaboration and delegation and look at management on a number of
   different layers-from low level network management, all the way up to
   high level business-driven management.},

Abstract = {We present a new general framework for constructing compact and
   adaptively secure attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes from k-Lin in
   asymmetric bilinear pairing groups. Previously, the only construction
   {[}Kowalczyk and Wee, Eurocrypt `19] that simultaneously achieves
   compactness and adaptive security from static assumptions supports
   policies represented by Boolean formulae. Our framework enables
   supporting more expressive policies represented by arithmetic branching
   programs.
   Our framework extends to ABE for policies represented by uniform models
   of computation such as Turing machines. Such policies enjoy the feature
   of being applicable to attributes of arbitrary lengths. We obtain the
   first compact adaptively secure ABE for deterministic and
   non-deterministic finite automata (DFA and NFA) from k-Lin, previously
   unknown from any static assumptions. Beyond finite automata, we obtain
   the first ABE for large classes of uniform computation, captured by
   deterministic and non-deterministic logspace Turing machines (the
   complexity classes L and NL) based on k-Lin. Our ABE scheme has compact
   secret keys of size linear in the description size of the Turing machine
   M. The ciphertext size grows linearly in the input length, but also
   linearly in the time complexity, and exponentially in the space
   complexity. Irrespective of compactness, we stress that our scheme is
   the first that supports large classes of Turing machines based solely on
   standard assumptions. In comparison, previous ABE for general Turing
   machines all rely on strong primitives related to indistinguishability
   obfuscation.},

Abstract = {Enhancement of an individual's security and protection is the major
   concern in the current era. Biometric security becomes a positive
   solution, adopted for many identification problems in various sectors,
   including Aviation. As the avionics business keeps growing worldwide,
   air terminals face the difficulties of increasingly more passenger
   volumes; with that, travelers' desire for a secure and consistent pass
   through the airport terminals is just expanding. COVID-19 has managed a
   hit in all parts of our lives. Maintaining social distance and wearing
   masks are very important in maintaining a person's health in this
   pandemic situation. In this scenario, facial recognition for passenger
   identification is difficult and tends to false acceptance of passengers
   with identical faces.
   To address this issue, contactless biometric traits like iris and
   fingerprints are considered for security growth. The paper deals with
   the fusion of iris and fingerprint to identify passengers without
   removing the masks and promotes safe travel. The iris and fingerprint
   features are extracted using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM) and
   cross number technique. Maintaining these templates requires more space
   for storage. To make this simple, Sparse autoencoder, an unsupervised
   deep learning technique is incorporated on the fused template for
   attaining the dimensionality reduction. A minimum cost matcher(MCM) is
   employed to increase the multimodal biometric system's accuracy and
   performance. Thus, the proposed system honors passenger security builds
   confidence in air travel, and also strives for economic growth.},

Title = {Choices of intercity multimodal passenger travel modes},
Journal = {PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {600},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {In recent years, transportation problems have evolved from city
   transportation problems to urban agglomeration problems. Thus, the
   development of Chinese transportation cannot neglect the role of
   Inter-City transportation being the infrastructural framework. Keep
   abreast of Inter-City passengers' choice behaviors can support the
   operation of multi-transportation systems. First, to better address the
   large deviation between the impedance function and the travelers'
   perceived cost, we construct the generalized cost function with seven
   terms, which are car time, waiting time, walking time, access/egress
   times, ticket price, transfer penalty and comfort level respectively,
   with reliability and security being taken into considerations. Second,
   pointing at the problem of low accuracy in calculating the sharing rate
   of various transportation modes under different traffic systems, we
   proposed a Two-Stage Path-Size Weibit (TS-PSW) model to calculate the
   sharing rate of multi-mode passenger flow between cities respectively.
   After that, we decomposed the TS-PSW model into two-layer Path-Size
   Weibit (PSW) model by the Two-Stage estimation method, and used the
   maximum likelihood estimation to solve PSW model respectively. Finally,
   using the intercity transportation networks (Chengdu- Chongqing,
   Guangzhou-Qingyuan, Beijing-Zhangjiakou) as background, compare six
   discrete choice models' calculation results. Result shows that the
   passenger flow sharing rate curve calculated by TS-PSW Model is
   evidently the closest to the actual transportation modes, the maximum
   error from Chengdu to Chongqing is 6.60\%, the minimum is 3.80\%, the
   maximum error from Beijing to Zhangjiakou is 10.20\%, and the minimum is
   3.30\%. Results verify the effectiveness of the proposed generalized
   cost function and mode choice model. The upcoming Winter Olympics will
   be held during the Spring Festival, other events will not be arranged at
   the same time. Therefore, travel demand will increase significantly.
   Improving the mode choice model and verifying its effectiveness on
   multiple intercity networks, especially the Beijing-Zhangjiakou network,
   can provide theoretical support for mastering passenger travel mode
   selection during the future Winter Olympics and further improving
   transportation planning and related deployment.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Erasable memory is an important resource for designing practical
   cryptographic protocols that are secure against adaptive attacks. Many
   practical memory devices such as solid state drives, hard disks, or file
   systems are not perfectly erasable because a deletion operation leaves
   traces of the deleted data in the system. A number of methods for
   constructing a large erasable memory from a small one, e.g., using
   encryption, have been proposed. Despite the importance of erasable
   memory in cryptography, no formal model has been proposed that allows
   one to formally analyse such memory constructions or cryptographic
   protocols relying on erasable memory.
   The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we provide a formal
   model of erasable memory. A memory device allows a user to store,
   retrieve, and delete data, and it is characterised by a leakage function
   defining the extent to which erased data is still accessible to an
   adversary.
   Second, we investigate how the erasability of such memories can be
   amplified. We provide a number of constructions of memories with strong
   erasability guarantees from memories with weaker guarantees. One of
   these constructions of perfectly erasable memories from imperfectly
   erasable ones can be considered as the prototypical application of
   Canetti et al. `s All-or-Nothing Transform (AoNT). Motivated by this
   construction, we propose some new and better AoNTs that are either
   perfectly or computationally secure. These AoNTs are of possible
   independent interest.
   Third, we show (in the constructive cryptography framework) how the
   construction of erasable memory and its use in cryptographic protocols
   (for example to achieve adaptive security) can naturally be composed to
   obtain provable security of the overall protocol.},

Abstract = {We propose new constructions for identity-based broadcast encryption
   (IBBE) and fuzzy identity-based encryption (FIBE) in bilinear groups of
   composite order. Our starting point is the IBBE scheme of Delerablee
   (Asiacrypt 2007) and the FIBE scheme of Herranz et al. (PKC 2010) proven
   secure under parameterised assumptions called generalised decisional
   bilinear Diffie-Hellman (GDDHE) and augmented multi-sequence of
   exponents Diffie-Hellman (aMSE-DDH) respectively. The two schemes are
   described in the prime-order pairing group. We transform the schemes
   into the setting of (symmetric) composite-order groups and prove
   security from two static assumptions (subgroup decision).
   The Deja, Q framework of Chase et al. (Asiacrypt 2016) is known to cover
   a large class of parameterised assumptions (dubbed fiber assumption),
   that is, these assumptions, when defined in asymmetric composite order
   groups, are implied by subgroup decision assumptions in the underlying
   composite-order groups. We argue that the GDDHE and aMSEDDH assumptions
   are not covered by the Deja, Q iiber assumption framework. We therefore
   work out direct security reductions for the two schemes based on
   subgroup decision assumptions. Furthermore, our proofs involve novel
   extensions of Deja, Q techniques of Wee (TCC 2016A) and Chase et al.
   Our constructions have constant-size ciphertexts. The IBBE has
   constant-size keys as well and guarantees stronger security as compared
   to Delerablee's IBBE, thus making it the first compact IBBE known to be
   selectively secure without random oracles under simple assumptions. The
   fuzzy IBE scheme is the first to simultaneously feature constant-size
   ciphertexts and security under standard assumptions.},

Title = {Adaptive management of multimodal biometrics fusion using ant colony

Abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for the adaptive management of
   multimodal biometrics to meet a wide range of application dependent
   adaptive security requirements. In this work, ant colony optimization
   (ACO) is employed for the selection of key parameters like decision
   threshold and fusion rule, to ensure the optimal performance in meeting
   varying security requirements during the deployment of multimodal
   biometrics systems. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been widely
   utilized for the optimal selection of these parameters in the earlier
   attempts in the literature {[}Veeramachaneni et al., 2005] and {[}Kumar
   et al., 2010]. However, in PSO these parameters are computed in
   continuous domain while they are assumed to be better represented as
   discrete variables {[}Kumar et al., 2010]. This paper therefore proposes
   the use of ACO, in which discrete biometric verification parameters are
   computed to ensure the optimal performance from the multimodal
   biometrics system. The proposed ACO based framework is also extended to
   the pattern classification approach where fuzzy binary decision tree
   (FBDT) is utilized for two-class biometrics verification. The
   experimental results are presented on true multimodal systems from
   various publicly available databases; IITD databases of palmprint and
   iris, XM2VTS database of speech and faces, and the NIST BSSR1 databases
   of faces and fingerprint images. Our experimental results presented in
   this paper suggest that (i) ACO based approach is capable of operating
   on significantly small error rates in comparison to the widely employed
   PSO for automated selection of biometrics fusion rules/parameters, (ii)
   the score-level fusion yields better performance with lower error rate
   in comparison to the decision level fusion, and finally (iii) the FBDT
   based classification approach delivers considerably superior performance
   for the adaptive biometrics verification. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Home Server plays an important role to manage all home network devices
   and multimedia content services in the digital home. Multimedia
   collaboration over wireless devices is inhibited by several factors and
   requires and advanced software architecture to support bandwidth
   reservation, QoS, reliability, availability and security. The decision
   based on a single input and a single security agent to serve all the
   needs of the home users is to be enhanced to facilitate multi-modal
   inputs with multiple integrated User Agents working to-ether to
   facilitate the new generation of dynamic wireless users at home.
   Cumulated with the technology trend of decreasing display sizes and
   ever-increasing array of features available to the user, it is very
   difficult to display all the features on the shrinking displays. Display
   has to be adaptive and context sensitive to adapt to the dynamic needs
   of the user. In this paper, we present our recent efforts for extending
   the functionalities of Home Server in order to support wireless
   multimedia collaboration and multi-modal context-sensitive analysis. We
   present a enhanced Home Server architecture that facilitates the
   existing model to be applied to incotporate wireless set-vices and
   wireless sensor networks for digital home automation. The plethora of
   possible inputs to the digital home infrastructure and the necessity for
   dynamic adaptive context-sensitive output extends the new design
   architecture to home servers and home networking devices.},

Abstract = {Mobile cloud computing integrates cloud computing into mobile
   environments, allowing users to use data, infrastructure, platforms, and
   applications on the cloud from their mobile devices. However, accessing
   and exploiting cloud-based resources and services is associated with
   numerous security implications (e.g. authentication and authorization)
   which represent the major barriers making individuals and organizations
   hesitant to migrate data or processing to the cloud. Using biometric
   techniques is increasingly emerging to secure such users' assets. In
   this paper, we propose a bi-modal continuous authentication approach
   integrating face and touch biometrics into mobile cloud environments,
   going beyond traditional one-off authentication. The system reacts to
   sliding windows of recent user's actions to dynamically update the trust
   in genuineness for the current user. For each biometric trait, it
   calculates the similarity scores resulting from the comparison between
   probes and templates, then they are fused together. If the fusion score
   is above a given threshold, the system rewards the current user;
   otherwise, they are penalized. In case the trust in the current user
   drops below a predefined threshold, the system raises an alarm.
   Experimental results indicate the advantage offered by our approach on
   performance of continuous authentication systems, providing a good
   security-usability tradeoff to mobile cloud environments.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes and evaluates a non-intrusive biometric
   authentication technique drawn from the discrete areas of biometrics and
   Auditory Evoked Responses. The technique forms a hybrid multi-modal
   biometric in which variations in the human voice due to the propagation
   effects of acoustic waves within the human head are used to verify the
   identity of a user. The resulting approach is known as the Head
   Authentication Technique (HAT). Evaluation of the HAT authentication
   process is realised in two stages. First, the generic authentication
   procedures of registration and verification are automated within a
   prototype implementation. Second, a HAT demonstrator is used to evaluate
   the authentication process through a series of experimental trials
   involving a representative user community. The results from the trials
   confirm that multiple HAT samples from the same user exhibit a high
   degree of correlation, yet samples between users exhibit a high degree
   of discrepancy. Statistical analysis of the prototype performance
   realised system error rates of 6\% False Non-Match Rate (FNMR) and
   0.025\% False Match Rate (FMR). (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Automatic personal identification is becoming an increasingly important
   requirement in a variety of applications like access control,
   surveillance systems and physical buildings. In recent years, biometric
   systems are used in these fields, offering greater convenience and
   several advantages over traditional security. In this paper, we propose
   an efficient online personal identification system based on
   Finger-Knuckle-Print (FKP) images. In this study, the finger image is
   characterized by the two dimensional Bloc based Discrete Cosine
   Transform (2D-BDCT) coefficients. Then, we use the Hidden Markov Model
   (HMM) for modeling the observation vector. In addition, the same finger
   is transformed by the two dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform
   (2D-DFT). The response of this transformation is directly used to create
   another observation vector. Subsequently, the two subsystems are
   integrated in order to construct an efficient multi-modal identification
   system based on matching score level fusion. The results on a
   medium-size database, 150 users, show good identification performance
   based on individual modalities as well as after fusing multiple finger
   types.},

Abstract = {A traitor tracing system is a multi-receiver encryption that allows an
   authority or an arbitrary party (in the case of public traceability) to
   identify malicious users (traitors) that collude to create a pirate
   decoder. A trace-and-revoke system is an extension of the traitor
   tracing system where there is an additional user revocation mechanism
   that the content distributor can use to disable the decryption
   capabilities of compromised keys. Trace-and-revoke systems have been
   extensively studied in the settings of broadcast encryption (BE),
   identity-based encryption (IBE), and attribute-based encryption (ABE),
   but not functional encryption (FE). Recently, Do, Phan and Pointcheval
   (CT-RSA'20) studied traitor tracing for FE and proposed the first
   traceable inner-product functional encryption (IPFE) scheme. However,
   their scheme is selectively secure against chosen-plaintext attacks and
   supports one-target black-box traceability (a weaker notion of black-box
   traceability). In addition, their scheme does not support public
   traceability nor user revocation. In this work, we study
   trace-and-revoke mechanisms for FE and propose the first efficient
   trace-and-revoke IPFE systems from standard assumptions. Our schemes
   support public, black-box traceability, and are proven adaptively secure
   against chosen-plaintext attacks in the standard model. Technically, our
   construction is generic and relies on a generic transformation from IPFE
   schemes to trace-and-revoke IPFE systems. For traitor tracing systems,
   our generic construction also implies the first traceable IPFE schemes
   that simultaneously support public, black-box traceability, and achieve
   adaptive security. This provides a significant improvement over the
   previous traceable IPFE construction by Do, Phan and Pointcheval.},

Abstract = {With the advent of cloud computing in an era of mass data, more and more
   people are motivated to utilize the outsourcing service. For the sake of
   the security of the outsourced data, these data have to be encrypted
   prior to outsource to the remote ``honest-but-curious{''} servers. So
   far, the searchable encryption technique based on the secure index
   becomes a key and lead solution. Unfortunately, there exists no such
   solution focusing on the synonym search in the symmetric-key setting. In
   consideration of finiteness of people's memory and lifetime of people's
   knowledge, we seriously study this issue.
   In this paper, we design a scheme for the problem of synonym search, and
   provide the proof of security. Our proposed technique has a number of
   crucial advantages. We for the first time put forward the problem of the
   synonym keyword search over remotely encrypted data in the context of
   cloud computing. In our scheme, we introduce the concepts of synonym
   function and synonym sets. We firstly implement a formal practical
   Synonym Symmetric Searchable Encryption Solution (PSSSE). Through
   rigorous security analysis, we show that our proposed solution is
   correct and privacy-preserving (non-adaptive security) without the loss
   of function of the scheme. Besides, the algorithms we present are simple
   and effective, it almost increases no space and computing overhead of
   the user. The overhead of communication still remains O(1). The time
   complexity of searching on encryption data is O(p) (p denotes the
   maximum number of synonym of keyword). To apply to general situation, we
   simultaneously give a practical trade-off between availability and
   performance. This scheme greatly enhances system usability by responding
   the answers that are all documents containing keyword and corresponding
   synonyms. Its occurrence obviously overcomes the deficiency of existing
   schemes. Hence, our solution is very significative to practical use and
   bridges the gap of state-of-art.},

Abstract = {In spite of many advantages, multi-modal biometric recognition systems
   are vulnerable to spoof attacks, which can decrease their level of
   security. Thus, it is fundamental to understand and analyse the effects
   of spoof attacks and propose new methods to design robust systems
   against them. To this aim, we are developing a method based on
   simulating the fake score distributions of individual matchers, to
   evaluate the relative robustness of different score fusion rules. We
   model the score distribution of fake traits by assuming it lies between
   the one of genuine and impostor scores, and parametrize it by a measure
   of the relative distance to the latter, named attack strength. Different
   values of the attack strength account for the many different factors
   which can affect the distribution of fake scores. In this paper we
   present preliminary results aimed at evaluating the capability of our
   model to approximate realistic fake score distributions. To this aim we
   use a data set made up of faces and fingerprints, including realistic
   spoof attacks traits.},

Abstract = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are promising solutions for safe and
   comfortable driving. The evolution of AVs are driven by various
   technical and socio-economic factors. Autonomous navigation in AVs is
   the ability to plan and navigate towards a destination, while dealing
   with the path's obstacles. Current research solutions rely on sensors
   and inter-vehicular communication to perceive the environment. But they
   are susceptible to threats ranging from physical damage to security
   issues. Hence, to improve the AV's perception capabilities, this article
   proposes a multi-modal mechanism known as Audio-Visual Cognitive
   Processing System (AV-CPS), which combines speech and gesture inputs
   from users to enable spontaneous passenger control for AVs. The results
   demonstrate over 20\% improvement in action prediction accuracy over
   uni-modal mechanisms and a relative reduction in response time from the
   simulation of the AV-CPS.},

Abstract = {Utilizing biometric traits for privacy-and security-applications is
   receiving an increasing attention. Applications such as personal
   identification, access control, forensics applications, e-banking,
   e-government, e-health and recently personalized human-smart-home and
   human-robot interaction present some examples. In order to offer
   person-specific services for/of specific person a pre-identifying step
   should be done in the run-up. Using biometric in such application is
   encountered by diverse challenges. First, using one trait and excluding
   the others depends on the application aimed to. Some applications demand
   directly touch to biometric sensors, while others don't. Second
   challenge is the reliability of used biometric arrangement. Civilized
   application demands lower reliability comparing to the forensics ones.
   And third, for biometric system could only one trait be used (uni-modal
   systems) or multiple traits (Bi-or Multi-modal systems). The latter is
   applied, when systems with a relative high reliability are expected. The
   main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive view about biometric
   and its application. The above mentioned challenges will be analyzed
   deeply. The suitability of each biometric sensor according to the aimed
   application will be deeply discussed. Detailed comparison between
   uni-modal and Multi-modal biometric system will present which system
   where to be utilized. Privacy and security issues of biometric systems
   will be discussed too. Three scenarios of biometric application in
   home-environment, humanrobot-interaction and e-health will be presented.},

Abstract = {Biometrics is now being principally employed in many daily applications
   ranging from the border crossing to mobile user authentication. In the
   high-security scenarios, biometrics require stringent accuracy and
   performance criteria. Towards this aim, multi-biometric systems that
   fuse the evidences from multiple sources of biometric have exhibited to
   diminish the error rates and alleviate inherent frailties of the
   individual biometric systems. In this article, a novel scheme for
   score-level fusion based on weighted quasi-arithmetic mean (WQAM) has
   been proposed. Specifically, WQAMs are estimated via different
   trigonometric functions. The proposed fusion scheme encompasses
   properties of both weighted mean and quasi-arithmetic mean. Moreover, it
   does not require any leaning process. Experimental results on three
   publicly available data sets (i.e. NIST-BSSR1 Multimodal, NIST-BSSR1
   Fingerprint and NIST-BSSR1 Face) for multi-modal, multi-unit and
   multi-algorithm systems show that presented WQAM fusion algorithm
   outperforms the previously proposed score fusion rules based on
   transformation (e.g. t-norms), classification (e.g. support vector
   machines) and density estimation (e.g. likelihood ratio) methods.},

Abstract = {Multi-Client Functional Encryption (MCFE) and MultiInput Functional
   Encryption (MIFE) are very interesting extensions of Functional
   Encryption for practical purpose. They allow to compute joint function
   over data from multiple parties. Both primitives are aimed at
   applications in multi-user settings where decryption can be correctly
   output for users with appropriate functional decryption keys only. While
   the definitions for a single user or multiple users were quite general
   and can be realized for general classes of functions as expressive as
   Turing machines or all circuits, efficient schemes have been proposed so
   far for concrete classes of functions: either only for access control,
   i.e. the identity function under some conditions, or linear/quadratic
   functions under no condition. In this paper, we target classes of
   functions that explicitly combine some evaluation functions independent
   of the decrypting user under the condition of some access control. More
   precisely, we introduce a framework for MCFE with fine-grained access
   control and propose constructions for both single-client and
   multi-client settings, for inner-product evaluation and access control
   via Linear Secret Sharing Schemes (LSSS), with selective and adaptive
   security. The only known work that combines functional encryption in
   multi-user setting with access control was proposed by Abdalla et al.
   (Asiacrypt `20), which relies on a generic transformation from the
   single-client schemes to obtain MIFE schemes that suffer a quadratic
   factor of n (where n denotes the number of clients) in the ciphertext
   size. We follow a different path, via MCFE: we present a
   duplicate-and-compress technique to transform the single-client scheme
   and obtain a MCFE with fine-grained access control scheme with only a
   linear factor of n in the ciphertext size. Our final scheme thus
   outperforms the Abdalla et al.'s scheme by a factor n, as one can obtain
   MIFE from MCFE by making all the labels in MCFE a fixed public constant.
   The concrete constructions are secure under the SXDH assumption, in the
   random oracle model for the MCFE scheme, but in the standard model for
   the MIFE improvement.},

Title = {A NoSQL-SQL Hybrid Organization and Management Approach for Real-Time
   Geospatial Data: A Case Study of Public Security Video Surveillance},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With the widespread deployment of ground, air and space sensor sources
   (internet of things or IoT, social networks, sensor networks), the
   integrated applications of real-time geospatial data from ubiquitous
   sensors, especially in public security and smart city domains, are
   becoming challenging issues. The traditional geographic information
   system (GIS) mostly manages time-discretized geospatial data by means of
   the Structured Query Language (SQL) database management system (DBMS)
   and emphasizes query and retrieval of massive historical geospatial data
   on disk. This limits its capability for on-the-fly access of real-time
   geospatial data for online analysis in real time. This paper proposes a
   hybrid database organization and management approach with SQL relational
   databases (RDB) and not only SQL (NoSQL) databases (including the main
   memory database, MMDB, and distributed files system, DFS). This hybrid
   approach makes full use of the advantages of NoSQL and SQL DBMS for the
   real-time access of input data and structured on-the-fly analysis
   results which can meet the requirements of increased spatio-temporal big
   data linking analysis. The MMDB facilitates real-time access of the
   latest input data such as the sensor web and IoT, and supports the
   real-time query for online geospatial analysis. The RDB stores change
   information such as multi-modal features and abnormal events extracted
   from real-time input data. The DFS on disk manages the massive
   geospatial data, and the extensible storage architecture and distributed
   scheduling of a NoSQL database satisfy the performance requirements of
   incremental storage and multi-user concurrent access. A case study of
   geographic video (GeoVideo) surveillance of public security is presented
   to prove the feasibility of this hybrid organization and management
   approach.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a secure authentication method based on
   multimodal biometrics system under ubiquitous computing environments.
   For this, the face and signature images are acquired in PDA and then
   each image with user ID and name is transmitted via WLAN (Wireless LAN)
   to the server and finally the PDA receives authentication result from
   the server. In the proposed system, face recognition algorithm is
   designed by PCA and LDA. On the other hand, the signature verification
   is designed by a novel method based on grid partition, Kernel PCA and
   LDA. To calculate the similarity between test image and training image,
   we adopt the selective distance measure determined by various
   experiments. More specifically, Mahalanobis and Euclidian distance
   measures are used for face and signature, respectively. As the fusion
   step, decision rule by weighted sum fusion scheme effectively combines
   the two matching scores calculated in each biometric system. From the
   real-time experiments, we convinced that the proposed system makes it
   possible to improve the security as well as user's convenience under
   ubiquitous computing environments.},

Abstract = {In current society, reliable identification and verification of
   individuals are becoming more and more necessary tasks for many fields,
   not only in police environment, but also in civilian applications, such
   as access control or financial transactions. Biometric systems are used
   nowadays in these fields, offering greater convenience and several
   advantages over traditional security methods based on something that you
   know (password) or something that you have (keys). In this paper, we
   propose an efficient online personal identification system based on
   Multi-Spectral Palmprint (MSP) images using Contourlet Transform (CT)
   and Gabor Filter (GF) response. In this study, the spectrum image is
   characterized by the contourlet coefficients sub-bands. Then, we use the
   Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for modeling the observation vector. In
   addition, the same spectrum is filtered by the Gabor filter. The real
   and imaginary responses of the filtering image are used to create
   another observation vector. Subsequently, the two sub-systems are
   integrated in order to construct an efficient multi-modal identification
   system based on matching score level fusion. Our experimental results
   show the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method, which
   brings both high identification and accuracy rate.},

Abstract = {Sound event recognition systems are rapidly becoming part of our life,
   since they can be profitably used in several vertical markets, ranging
   from audio security applications to scene classification and multi-modal
   analysis in social robotics. In the last years, a not negligible part of
   the scientific community started to apply Convolutional Neural Networks
   (CNNs) to image-based representations of the audio stream, due to their
   successful adoption in almost all the computer vision tasks. In this
   paper, we carry out a detailed benchmark of various widely used CNN
   architectures and visual representations on a popular dataset, namely
   the MIVIA Audio Events database. Our analysis is aimed at understanding
   how these factors affect the sound event recognition performance with a
   particular focus on the false positive rate, very relevant in audio
   surveillance solutions. In fact, although most of the proposed solutions
   achieve a high recognition rate, the capability of distinguishing the
   events-of-interest from the background is often not yet sufficient for
   real systems, and prevent its usage in real applications. Our
   comprehensive experimental analysis investigates this aspect and allows
   to identify useful design guidelines for increasing the specificity of
   sound event recognition systems.},

Abstract = {Smartphones have recently seen massive growth in usage and become a
   repository for many types of personal information. The privacy and
   security are primary concerns for their usage, where there is a need to
   provide seamless and continuous authentication systems(CASs) for
   smartphones. We introduce in this work a proof-of-concept design and a
   case study for using a biologically-inspired and hardware-friendly CAS.
   Our proposed design adopts a hybrid Liquid State Machine (LSM) approach
   to perform automatic features extraction and multi-modal fusion scheme
   for users' interaction. Our work establishes the design concepts for
   future on-chip and explains why LSM can be a promising approach for
   fast, adaptive and reliable hardware CASs. The experimental part reveals
   our proof-of-concept testing results against the golden standard
   features. Furthermore, The results indicate a promising future for such
   design and a potential biologically-inspired CASs.},

Abstract = {Temporal logic of knowledge is a combination of temporal and epistemic
   logic that has been shown to be very useful in areas such as distributed
   systems, security, and multi-agent systems. However, the complexity of
   the logic can be prohibitive. We here develop a refined version of such
   a logic and associated tableau procedure with improved complexity but
   where important classes of specification can still be described. This
   new logic represents a combination of an ``exactly one{''} temporal
   logic with an S5 multi-modal logic again restricted to the ``exactly
   one{''} form.},

Abstract = {Currently in home environments, robot assisting systems with emotion
   understanding ability are generally achieved in two several manners. The
   first is the implementing of such systems in such a way that they offer
   general services for all considered persons without considering privacy,
   special needs of their interaction partners. The second way is the
   targetting of such systems for merely one person. In this work we
   present a robot assisting system, which has both the abilities of
   assisting several persons at the same time and sustaining their privacy
   and security issues. The robot can interact with it's interaction
   partner emotionally by analyzing the emotions of her expressed either
   visually, facial expression, or auditive, speech prosody. The role of
   this system is the providing of person-specific support in home
   environment. In order to identify its interaction partner the system
   uses diverse biometric traits. According to the recognized ID the
   system, first, adopts towards the needs of recognized person. Second the
   system loads the corresponding emotional profile of the detected
   interaction partner in order to practice a person-specific emotional
   human-robot interaction, which has an advantage over the person
   independent interaction.},

Abstract = {Pedestrian detection is a key problem in many computer vision
   applications, especially in surveillance and security systems. To this
   end, information integration from different imaging modalities, such as
   thermal infrared and visible spectrum, can significantly improve the
   detection rate in respect to mono-modal strategies. For this reason, an
   effective fusion scheme is necessary to combine the information
   presented by multiple sensors. In this paper, we propose a pedestrian
   classification method based on the multiple kernel learning framework;
   standard pixel features (such as spatial derivatives) from both imaging
   modalities are employed to learn several feature-related basic kernels
   and a compound kernel is found as an optimized linear combination of
   basic kernels. Finally the compound kernel is used to train an SVM.
   Experiments performed on the OTCBVS dataset {[}1], demonstrate that our
   recipe definitely outclasses a wide set of literature fusion modalities.},

Abstract = {We have developed a flexible, target-driven, multi-modal, physics-based
   fusion architecture that efficiently searches sensor detections for
   targets and rejects clutter while controlling the combinatoric problems
   that commonly arise in data-driven fusion systems. The informational
   constraints imposed by long lifetime requirements make systems
   vulnerable to false alarms. We demonstrate that our data fusion system
   significantly reduces false alarms while maintaining high sensitivity to
   threats. In addition, mission goals can vary substantially in terms of
   targets-of-interest, required characterization, acceptable latency, and
   false alarm rates. Our fusion architecture provides the flexibility to
   match these trade-offs with mission requirements unlike many
   conventional systems that require significant modifications for each new
   mission.
   We illustrate our data fusion performance with case studies that span
   many of the potential mission scenarios including border surveillance,
   base security, and infrastructure protection. In these studies, we
   deployed multi-modal sensor nodes - including geophones, magnetometers,
   accelerometers and PIR sensors - with low-power processing algorithms
   and low-bandwidth wireless mesh networking to create networks capable of
   multi-year operation. The results show our data fusion architecture
   maintains high sensitivities while suppressing most false alarms for a
   variety of environments and targets.},

Abstract = {Authentication on smartphones for high valued transactions in e-banking
   applications require authentication methods that are both more robust
   and more convenient than simple PIN based authentication. Although a two
   factor authentication approach can increase the system security, the
   second factor has to be robust enough not to be compromised by simple
   attacks. Face and periocular based biometrics have been explored in many
   works for authentication on smartphone. Multi-modal biometrics always
   have an edge over the unimodal biometrics. In this work, we explore
   various multi-modal biometrics employing feature level and score level
   fusion to improve the biometric performance of the system. An extensive
   number of experiments are conducted using two different devices -
   Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. The
   database consisting of 46 subjects has provided a performance with best
   Genuine Match Rate (GMR) of 95. 52\% for smartphone and 96. 65\% GMR for
   tablet. The obtained scores for feature level and score level fusion
   advocates the use of a fused approaches over a unimodal biometric
   authentication on the smartphones.},

Abstract = {We present an autonomous system capable of performing security check
   routines. The surveillance machine, the Clearpath Husky robotic
   platform, is equipped with three IP cameras with different orientations
   for the surveillance tasks of face recognition, human activity
   recognition, autonomous navigation and 3D reconstruction of its
   environment. Combining the computer vision algorithms onto a robotic
   machine has given birth to the Robust Artificial Intelligence-based
   Defense Electro-Robot (RAIDER). The end purpose of the RAIDER is to
   conduct a patrolling routine on a single floor of a building several
   times a day. As the RAIDER travels down the corridors off-line
   algorithms use two of the RAIDER's side mounted cameras to perform a 3D
   reconstruction from monocular vision technique that updates a 3D model
   to the most current state of the indoor environment. Using frames from
   the front mounted camera, positioned at the human eye level, the system
   performs face recognition with real time training of unknown subjects.
   Human activity recognition algorithm will also be implemented in which
   each detected person is assigned to a set of action classes picked to
   classify ordinary and harmful student activities in a hallway setting.
   The system is designed to detect changes and irregularities within an
   environment as well as familiarize with regular faces and actions to
   distinguish potentially dangerous behavior. In this paper, we present
   the various algorithms and their modifications which when implemented on
   the RAIDER serves the purpose of indoor surveillance.},

Abstract = {With the growing demand for information security, finger-vein
   recognition has become widespread. However, the robustness of the
   recognition process becomes a major problem. When identifying unseen
   categories with traditional finger-vein recognition systems, a few
   issues remain, such as recognition interference and low efficiency. This
   paper proposes a Deep Generalized Label Finger-Vein (DGLFV) model to
   extract feature maps and achieve high-accuracy recognition. The largest
   rectangular finger-vein region is extracted through image semantic
   segmentation and the advanced bidirectional traversing and center
   diffusion method for the known categories. Then we generalize all the
   unseen categories actively as Class C + 1 to reduce interference from
   unregistered users. Furthermore, an adaptive threshold acquisition
   algorithm is proposed for Label Receiver Operating Characteristic
   (LROC), so that the procedures of classification, recognition, and
   verification are unified. Apart from Shandong University Homologous
   Multi-modal Traits (SDUMLA-HMT), we have conducted additional
   experiments on our self-built database, Finger Veins of Signal and
   Information Processing Laboratory (FV-SIPL). The recognition accuracy of
   the approach proposed in this paper has reached 99.25\% and 99.08\%
   testing on FV-SIPL and SDUMLA-HMT, with a low error rate at 1.481\% and
   2.228\% and little time consumption of 0.157s for a single image, which
   is better than most state-of-the-art finger-vein recognition methods.},

Abstract = {Biometric Authentication Systems (BAS) have several security benefits
   over traditional password and token authentication including an inherent
   difficulty to copy, clone and share or distribute authentication
   credentials (biometric traits). Spoofing or presentation attack remains
   a major weakness of biometric systems and tackling it at the trait level
   is still challenging with several different approaches and methods
   applied in existing systems. In this paper, we focus on the well-known
   approach of Suspicious Presentation Detection (SPD) and present the
   Multi-Modal Random Trait Biometric Liveness Detection System (MMRTBLDS)
   that further mitigates spoofing or presentations attacks using
   randomization and combination of several different SPD detection
   techniques across three different modalities during trait capture. We
   discuss the detection of life using five distinct properties each from
   finger, face and eye modalities and present results from a simulation
   that highlights the improved security based on an impostor's inability
   to accurately predict the combination of trait liveness properties the
   system might prompt and test for during capture.},

Abstract = {Biometric system using face recognition is the frontier of the security
   across various applications in the fields of multimedia, medicine,
   civilian surveillance, robotics, etc. Differences in illumination
   levels, pose variations, eye-wear, facial hair, aging and disguise are
   some of the current challenges in face recognition. The ear, which is
   turning out to be a promising biometric identifier having some desirable
   properties such as universality, uniqueness, permanence, can also be
   used along with face for better performance of the system. A multi-modal
   biometric system combining 2D face, 3D face (depth image) and ear
   modalities using Microsoft Kinect and Webcam is proposed to address
   these challenges to some extent. Also avoiding redundancy in the
   extracted features for better processing speed is another challenge in
   designing the system. After careful survey of the existing algorithms
   applied to 2D face, 3D face and ear data, we focus on the well-known PCA
   (Principal Component Analysis) based Eigen Faces algorithm for ear and
   face recognition to obtain a better performance with minimal
   computational requirements. The resulting proposed system turns out
   insensitive to lighting conditions, pose variations, aging and can
   completely replace the current recognition systems economically and
   provide a better security. A total of 109 subjects participated in
   diversified data acquisition sessions involving multiple poses,
   illuminations, eyewear and persons from different age groups. The
   dataset is also a first attempt on the stated combination of biometrics
   and is a contribution to the field of Biometrics by itself for future
   experiments. The results are obtained separately against each biometric
   and final decision is obtained using all the individual results for
   higher accuracy. The proposed system performed at 98.165 \% verification
   rate which is greater than either of the dual combinations or each of
   the stated modality in a statistical and significant manner.},

Abstract = {In this paper we introduce the notion of lockable obfuscation. In a
   lockable obfuscation scheme there exists an obfuscation algorithm Obf
   that takes as input a security parameter, a program P, a message msg and
   ``lock value{''} lck and outputs an obfuscated program oP. One can
   evaluate the obfuscated program oP on any input x where the output of
   evaluation is the message msg if P(x) = lck and otherwise receives a
   rejecting symbol.
   We proceed to provide a construction of lockable obfuscation and prove
   it secure under the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption. Notably, our
   proof only requires LWE with polynomial hardness and does not require
   complexity leveraging.
   We follow this by describing multiple applications of lockable
   obfuscation. First, we show how to transform any attributebased
   encryption (ABE) scheme into one in which the attributes used to encrypt
   the message are hidden from any user that is not authorized to decrypt
   the message. (Such a system is also know as predicate encryption with
   one-sided security.) The only previous construction due to Gorbunov,
   Vaikuntanathan and Wee is based off of a specific ABE scheme of Boneh et
   al. By enabling the transformation of any ABE scheme we can inherent
   different forms and features of the underlying scheme such as:
   multi-authority, adaptive security from polynomial hardness, regular
   language policies, etc.
   We also show applications of lockable obfuscation to separation and
   uninstantiability results. We first show how to create new separation
   results in circular encryption that were previously based on
   indistinguishability obfuscation. This results in new separation results
   from learning with error including a public key bit encryption scheme
   that it IND-CPA secure and not circular secure. The tool of lockable
   obfuscation allows these constructions to be almost immediately realized
   by translation from previous indistinguishability obfuscation based
   constructions.
   In a similar vein we provide random oracle uninstantiability results of
   the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation (and related transformations) from
   the lockable obfuscation combined with fully homomorphic encryption.
   Again, we take advantage that previous work used indistinguishability
   obfuscation that obfuscated programs in a form that could easily be
   translated to lockable obfuscation.},

Abstract = {Purpose The increase of turbulence sources and risk points under the
   complex social information network has brought severe challenges. This
   paper discusses risk perception and intelligent decision-making under
   the complex social information network to maintain social security and
   financial security. Design/methodology/approach Cross-modal semantic
   fusion and social risk perception, temporal knowledge graph and
   analysis, complex social network intelligent decision-making methods
   have been studied. A big data computing platform of software and
   hardware integration for security combat is constructed based on the
   technical support. Findings The software and hardware integration
   platform driven by big data can realize joint identification of
   significant risks, intelligent analysis and large-scale group
   decision-making. Practical implications The integrated platform can
   monitor the abnormal operation and potential associated risks of Listed
   Companies in real-time, reduce information asymmetry and accounting
   costs and improve the capital market's ability to serve the real
   economy. It can also provide critical technical support and decision
   support in necessary public opinion monitoring and control business.
   Originality/value In this paper, the theory of knowledge-enhanced
   multi-modal multi-granularity dynamic risk analysis and intelligent
   group decision-making and the idea of an inference think tank (I-aid-S)
   is proposed. New technologies and methods, such as association analysis,
   time series evolution and super large-scale group decision-making, have
   been established. It's also applied in behavior and situation deduction,
   public opinion and finance and provides real-time, dynamic, fast and

Abstract = {The rise of WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) and widely adopted WSN
   services on environmental monitoring make our lives safer. To bring
   higher level of intelligent services into lives, integration of various
   networking services in one area is a must. For example, in traditional
   security camera system, object stolen event is only handled as a post
   processing service. But, if we integrate WSN positioning service with
   intelligent cameras, it is possible to differentiate the object stolen
   event from the authorized moving event in real time, thus reduce false
   alarm dramatically. And also it is possible to notify a nearest security
   guard to handle the event if it is decided not an authorized moving
   event. We developed a multi-modal surveillance system by integrating
   WSN, ZigBee positioning, audio and video event defection over
   cooperative sensor network to provide useful services. With the
   cooperation of different sensors, our system will keep our lives more
   secure. by only signaling true event that needs to be handled.},

Abstract = {Multimodal biometric system has emerged as a highly successful new
   approach to combat problems of unimodal biometric system such as
   intraclass variability, interclass similarity, data quality,
   non-universality, and sensitivity to noise. The idea behind the
   cancelable biometric or cancelability is to transform a biometric data
   or feature into a new one so that the stored biometric template can be
   easily changed in a biometric security system. In this paper, we present
   a novel architecture for template generation within the context of the
   cancelable multimodal system. We develop a novel cancelable biometric
   template generation algorithm using random projection and
   transformation-based feature extraction and selection. We further
   validate the performance of the proposed algorithm on a virtual multi

Title = {A fast feature selection technique in multi modal biometrics using cloud

Abstract = {Biometrics refers to the process that uses biological or physiological
   traits to identify individuals. The progress seen in technology and
   security has a vital role to play in Biometric recognition which is a
   reliable technique to validate individuals and their identity. The
   biometric identification is generally based on either their physical
   traits or their behavioural traits. The multimodal biometrics makes use
   of either two or more of the modalities to improve recognition. There
   are some popular modalities of biometrics that are palm print, finger
   vein, iris, face or fingerprint recognition. Another important challenge
   found with multimodal biometric features is the fusion, which could
   result in a large set of feature vectors. Most biometric systems
   currently use a single model for user authentication. In this existing
   work, a modified method of heuristics that is efficiently used to
   identify an optimal feature set that is based on a wrapper-based feature
   selection technique. The proposed method of feature selection uses the
   Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
   are used to feature extraction and classification process utilizes the
   integration of face, and finger print texture patterns. The set of
   training images is converted to grayscale. The crossover operator is
   applied to generate multiple samples for each number of images. The wok
   proposed here is pre-planned for each weight of each biometric modality,
   which ensures that even if a biometric modality does not exist at the
   time of verification, a person can be certified to provide calculated
   weights the threshold value. The proposed method is demonstrated better
   result for fast feature selection in bio metric image authentication and
   also gives high effectiveness security.},

Abstract = {Having timely and credible security information is becoming critical to
   network and security management. Most current sources of threat
   information and detection techniques suffer from having a limited view
   of the global threat scenario. In this paper, we present Foresight, an
   internet scale threat analysis, indication, early warning and response
   architecture. We describe the design of an incentive based cooperation
   scheme to create a global trusted community which is more accountable
   and hence less vulnerable to attacks and abuse. Foresight utilizes this
   infrastructure to share a global threat view in order to detect unknown
   threats and isolate them. We describe a novel behavioral signature
   scheme to extract a generalized footprint for multi-modal threats.
   System performance analysis through trace-based simulations show
   significant benefits for sharing forensics across cooperating domains.},

Abstract = {Utilizing biometric traits for privacy-and securityapplications is
   receiving an increasing attention. Applications such as personal
   identification, access control, forensics applications, e-banking,
   e-government, e-health and recently personalized human-smart-home and
   human-robot interaction present some examples. In order to offer
   person-specific services for/of specific person a pre-identifying step
   should be done in the run-up. Using biometric in such application is
   encountered by diverse challenges. First, using one trait and excluding
   the others depends on the application aimed to. Some applications demand
   directly touch to biometric sensors, while others don't. Second
   challenge is the reliability of used biometric arrangement. Civilized
   application demands lower reliability comparing to the forensics ones.
   And third, for biometric system could only one trait be used (uni-modal
   systems) or multiple traits (Bi-or Multi-modal systems). The latter is
   applied, when systems with a relative high reliability are expected. The
   main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive view about biometric
   and its application. The above mentioned challenges will be analyzed
   deeply. The suitability of each biometric sensor according to the aimed
   application will be deeply discussed. Detailed comparison between
   uni-modal and Multi-modal biometric system will present which system
   where to be utilized. Privacy and security issues of biometric systems
   will be discussed too. Three scenarios of biometric application in
   home-environment, humanrobot- interaction and e-health will be
   presented.},

Abstract = {Distribution Feeder Reconfiguration (DFR) is an important technique to
   improve the performance of distribution networks. The common objectives
   considered in the DFR problem are power loss and voltage deviation which
   are important objectives for traditional distribution systems. Security
   issues cause by Distributed Generations (DGs) in modern distribution
   systems which can potentially jeopardize power system security has
   almost neglected in power system operation problem. Toward this end,
   this study considers the power loss, Voltage Stability Index (VSI), and
   number of switching as objective functions which can satisfy both
   operation and security expectations. The Backward-Forward Sweep (BFS)
   method known for easy convergence has been employed for power flow
   calculations. Because of the increase in DG penetration in distributed
   systems, the impacts of these units are investigated. A powerful
   optimization algorithm based on hybridization of Shuffled Frog Leaping
   Algorithm (SFLA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed to
   solve the proposed problem. The proposed algorithm is a combination of
   strong mutation operator, original SFLA and original PSO algorithms
   which has high population diversity and search ability. The proposed
   algorithm has been applied to a complex multi modal benchmark function
   and also two different distribution networks including 33- and 95-bus
   test systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The relationship between physical security and critical infrastructure
   has traditionally been unidirectional - the former being necessary to
   sustain the latter. However, certain pieces of critical infrastructure
   hold the potential to significantly improve the security of individuals
   and their most sensitive information. In this paper, we develop a pair
   of mechanisms for cellular networks and mobile devices that augment the
   physical security of their users' financial credentials. In particular,
   we create FrauVent, a multi-modal protocol that provides users with
   information related to a pending questionable transaction (e.g.,
   transaction value, location, vendor) in a way that improves the
   available context for approving or rejecting such exchanges. Through
   protocol design, formal verification and implementation of an
   application for the Android platform, we develop a robust tool to help
   reduce the costs of fraud without requiring financial institutions to
   significantly change their extensively deployed end systems (i.e., card
   readers). More critically, we provide a general framework that allows
   cellular infrastructure to actively improve the physical security of
   sensitive information.},

Abstract = {Security and user privacy are areas of concern in digital transactions
   over a network. Integration of biometric pattern matching into an
   identity management system (IMS) enhances security of transactions and
   improves ease of use. Privacy of users in a biometric based system is
   improved by using keys generated directly from feature sets instead of
   conventional stored templates. This paper proposes a framework for
   integrating biometric key based authentication into an IMS. The
   generated keys need to be consistent. Consistency of keys is attained if
   the same key is generated for every instance of biometric input.
   Generation of long and consistent keys directly from feature sets poses
   a challenge due to intra and inter user variations inherent to biometric
   data. A novel methodology for generating consistent keys using
   principles of vector quantization and cluster based learning is
   introduced. 15-bit keys have been extracted from handwritten signature
   datasets. The results are promising and can be extended to multi-modal
   biometric feature sets.},

Abstract = {Abnormal behavior poses a great threat to social security and stability.
   The resulting violence or crime leads to terrible consequences. How to
   utilize reasonable means to predict the dangerous intentions of massive
   crowds and prevent the potential hazard to the public is significant for
   social security. A crowd monitoring and management system is an
   effective way to detect abnormal behavior. In this article, we release
   unmanned aerial vehicles as well as fixed ground devices to achieve
   multi-level and multi-modal behavioral sensing on a massive crowd,
   deploy a hybrid model in edge cloud to extract global features from
   behavioral data of a massive crowd, and then utilize these global
   features to construct decent classification algorithms for action
   recognition and behavioral semantic cognition. With the cooperation of
   behavioral data and cognitive algorithms, we can understand the
   instantaneous emotions of the crowd. On the basis of behavioral data and
   the emotional state of the crowd, the correlation between daily behavior
   and any dangerous intention of a massive crowd has been revealed by
   utilizing behavioral big data analysis, which is a key foundation for
   predicting people's dangerous intentions. Finally, we conduct a case
   study of abnormal behavior detection based on pix2pix and continuous
   video frames. The experimental results show that the performance of our
   method is better than other algorithms in both public datasets and the
   customized Hajj dataset. The proposed novel pattern for the effective
   learning of a massive crowd is validated to effectively eliminate some
   of the possible dangers caused by abnormal behavior.},

Title = {A Novel Fusion System Based on Iris and Ear Biometrics for E-exams},

Abstract = {With the rapid spread of the coronavirus epidemic all over the world,
   educational and other institutions are heading towards digitization. In
   the era of digitization, identifying educational e-platform users using
   ear and iris based multi -modal biometric systems constitutes an urgent
   and interesting research topic to pre-serve enterprise security,
   particularly with wearing a face mask as a precaution against the new
   coronavirus epidemic. This study proposes a multimodal system based on
   ear and iris biometrics at the feature fusion level to identify students
   in electronic examinations (E-exams) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   proposed system comprises four steps. The first step is image
   preprocessing, which includes enhancing, segmenting, and extracting the
   regions of interest. The second step is feature extraction, where the
   Haralick texture and shape methods are used to extract the features of
   ear images, whereas Tamura texture and color histogram methods are used
   to extract the features of iris images. The third step is feature
   fusion, where the extracted features of the ear and iris images are
   combined into one sequential fused vector. The fourth step is the
   matching, which is executed using the City Block Dis-tance (CTB) for
   student identification. The findings of the study indicate that the
   system's recognition accuracy is 97\%, with a 2\% False Acceptance Rate
   (FAR), a 4\% False Rejection Rate (FRR), a 94\% Correct Recognition Rate
   (CRR), and a 96\% Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR). In addition, the
   proposed recognition sys-tem achieved higher accuracy than other related
   systems.},

Abstract = {Biometrics based authentication systems face the major challenge in
   securing the template. Although multi-modal biometric techniques and
   cryptographic techniques offer security but they can be easily
   compromised. This paper explores the possibility of combining features
   from the same biometric trait (fingerprints) i.e. keeping it unimodal
   but still offering the same security as that of the combined biometrics.
   In this paper, using minutiae and orientation features from two
   different fingerprints, a new unique mixed fingerprint template is
   generated. The advantage of creating the mixed template is that it is
   cancellable and serves as a new virtual identity. Further Gabor feature
   of the mixed template is extracted before matching to reduce the error
   rate. Testing the templates is done using 2 methods, viz: correlation
   based and minutiae based. These two methods were effective in
   identifying the templates accurately. The FAR=0.08\% and FRR=0.1\%},

Abstract = {Quantum teleportation provides a way to transmit information from one
   location to another via a quantum channel. In traditional teleportation
   schemes, if the quantum channel is a non-maximally entangled quantum
   state, the success probability of teleporting an unknown
   three-dimensional quantum state can not be reached 100\%. Here we
   propose a deterministic teleportation scheme to overcome this challenge,
   and our results show that the success probability of teleporting a
   three-dimensional quantum state can be increased to 100\%. In
   particular, we have analyzed the security of our teleportation process,
   including particle transmission, and proved this process safe. Our
   scheme has high experimental feasibility.},

Abstract = {For server and network administrators, it is a challenge to keep an
   overview of their systems to detect potential intrusions and security
   risks in real-time as well as in retrospect. Most security tools
   leverage our inherent ability for pattern detection by visualizing
   different types of security data. Several studies suggest that
   complementing visualization with sonification (the presentation of data
   using sound) can alleviate some of the challenges of visual monitoring
   (such as the need for constant visual focus). This paper therefore
   provides an overview of the current state of research regarding
   auditory-based and multi-modal tools in computer security. Most existing
   research in this area is geared towards supporting users in real-time
   network and server monitoring, while there are only few approaches that
   are designed for retrospective data analysis. There exist several
   sonification-based tools in a mature state, but their effectiveness has
   hardly been tested in formal user and usability studies. Such studies
   are however needed to provide a solid basis for deciding which type of
   sonification is most suitable for which kind of scenarios and how to
   best combine the two modalities, visualization and sonification, to
   support users in their daily routines.},

Abstract = {The goal of the research reported here was to investigate whether the
   design methodology utilising embodied agents can be applied to produce a
   multi-modal human-computer interface for cyberspace events visualisation
   control. This methodology requires that the designed system structure be
   defined in terms of cooperating agents having well-defined internal
   components exhibiting specified behaviours. System activities are
   defined in terms of finite state machines and behaviours parameterised
   by transition functions. In the investigated case the multi-modal
   interface is a component of the Operational Centre which is a part of
   the National Cybersecurity Platform. Embodied agents have been
   successfully used in the design of robotic systems. However robots
   operate in physical environments, while cyberspace events visualisation
   involves cyberspace, thus the applied design methodology required a
   different definition of the environment. It had to encompass the
   physical environment in which the operator acts and the computer screen
   where the results of those actions are presented. Smart human-computer
   interaction (HCI) is a time-aware, dynamic process in which two parties
   communicate via different modalities, e.g., voice, gesture, eye
   movement. The use of computer vision and machine intelligence techniques
   are essential when the human is carrying an exhausting and concentration
   demanding activity. The main role of this interface is to support
   security analysts and operators controlling visualisation of cyberspace
   events like incidents or cyber attacks especially when manipulating
   graphical information. Visualisation control modalities include visual
   gesture- and voice-based commands.},

Title = {DataOps for Cyber-Physical Systems Governance: The Airport Passenger
   Flow Case},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Recent advancements in information technology have ushered a new wave of
   systems integrating Internet technology with sensing, wireless
   communication, and computational resources over existing
   infrastructures. As a result, myriad complex, non-traditional
   Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have emerged, characterized by interaction
   among people, physical facilities, and embedded sensors and computers,
   all generating vast amounts of complex data. Such a case is encountered
   within a contemporary airport hall setting: passengers roaming,
   information systems governing various functions, and data being
   generated and processed by cameras, phones, sensors, and other Internet
   of Things technology. This setting has considerable potential of
   contributing to goals entertained by the CPS operators, such as
   airlines, airport operators/owners, technicians, users, and more. We
   model the airport setting as an instance of such a complex,
   data-intensive CPS where multiple actors and data sources interact, and
   generalize a methodology to support it and other similar systems.
   Furthermore, this article instantiates the methodology and pipeline for
   predictive analytics for passenger flow, as a characteristic
   manifestation of such systems requiring a tailored approach. Our
   methodology also draws from DataOps principles, using multi-modal and
   real-life data to predict the underlying distribution of the passenger
   flow on a flight-level basis (improving existing day-level predictions),
   anticipating when and how the passengers enter the airport and move
   through the check-in and baggage drop-off process. This allows to plan
   airport resources more efficiently while improving customer experience
   by avoiding passenger clumping at check-in and security. We demonstrate
   results obtained over a case from a major international airport in the
   Netherlands, improving up to 60\% upon predictions of daily passenger
   flow currently in place.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, Multimodal biometric is being deployed to overcome the
   challenges of spoofing which is encountered by unimodal biometrics.
   However, security is still compromised using multi modal biometric, thus
   requiring the attention of researchers. In view to increase security, an
   attempt of deploying multiple machine learning techniques on fused
   pattern have been explored and developed. Two enhanced algorithms of
   Chaotic Neural Network and NeuroEvolution of the augmenting topology
   have been devised and applied on the fused features. To verify the
   trustworthiness of the proposed system, several experiments have been
   deployed on both unimodal and multimodal systems. After several
   experiments performed, the algorithms reveal that multi biometric system
   exhibit higher recognition rates and lower false rejection rates
   compared to unimodal systems. In this research, we have also shown that
   algorithms have the possibility to countermeasure the loopholes that may
   occur at the matching module. We have achieved a good recognition rate
   of 99.1\% by adopting score level fusion by using the proposed
   NeuroEvolution of the augmenting topology algorithm compared to previous
   research work conducted. Thus, the proposed solution has proved to be
   stable while using fused features.},

Abstract = {The paper presents the scores of the GMM (Gaussian Mixture Models) based
   speaker verification system for speech signal transmitted in VoIP (Voice
   over IP) telephony conditions. The speaker verification problem was
   partly solved over traditional PSTN networks (Public Switched Telephone
   Network), however nowadays it is also important to assess flow specific
   distortions of VoIP transmission influence the speaker verification
   scores. As a reference database XM2VTS (Extended multi Modal
   Verification for Teleservices and Security appliations Data Base)
   containing English speech (strings of digits) was applied. Three coder
   degradations (PCM, G.711A and G.723.1) and three network conditions were
   examined in various configurations to estimate the influence of each,
   coding and transmission degradation for the final verification scores.},

Title = {Android-GAN: Defending against android pattern attacks using multi-modal
   generative network as anomaly detector},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {141},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Android pattern lock system is a popular form of user authentication
   extensively used in mobile phones today. However, it is vulnerable to
   potential security attacks such as shoulder surfing, camera attack and
   smudge attack. This study proposes a new kind of authentication system
   based on a generative deep neural network that can defend any attacks by
   imposters except a registered user. This network adopts the anomaly
   detection paradigm where only normal data is used while training the
   network. For this purpose, we utilize both Generative Adversarial
   Networks as an anomaly detector and Long Short Term Memory that
   processes ID time varying signals converted from 2D Android patterns. To
   handle the stability problem of GANs during the training, Replay Buffer,
   which has been effectively used in Deep Q-Networks, is also utilized.
   Evaluation of the proposed method was carried out thoroughly and the
   accuracy reached to 0.95 in term of the Area Under Curve. Although
   training this network requires extensive computing resources, it runs on
   a mobile phone well since the testing version is very light. Further
   experiments conducted using a group of mobile phone users, including
   posture variation study, provided comparable performance as well.
   Results suggest that the proposed system has a potential for real world
   application. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Intelligent robots need to have the ability to adjust their actions,
   state and behavior (i.e., response), as per the inputs that could be
   influenced by their immediate environment and/or situation/s. Hence,
   intelligent robots have diverse applications in domains such as
   security, automation, industry and agriculture. Such robots when used
   for surveillance or spying operations by military or police forces are
   called spybots. This paper aims to highlight the need and importance of
   developing systems that have the ability to remotely control their
   functions, response and operation, using multiple-controls and commands
   given by multiple-modalities. As an example, to give a live physical
   demonstration of the proposed concepts, a prototype smart spybot is
   developed. The prototype spybot can be controlled using multi-modalities
   such as text, touch, speech and gestures. It can be remotely operated
   using an application running on an Android based smart-phone, or a
   website, or an interactive program running on a laptop. Each can be
   connected by wires or wirelessly. The prototype spybot also has decision
   making capability and obstacle-avoidance feature. It is GPS enabled, and
   can be used as a tracker also. This intelligent spybot can directly
   fetch the live-video feeds and the spied data to a website, along with
   GPS coordinates. Since the prototype spybot is speech and
   gesture-enabled, it can also be used effectively by the people having
   restricted physical abilities. The initial performance results and
   trials are encouraging. The prototype spybot can potentially be used for
   a range of applications.},

Abstract = {Active authentication is the process of continuously verifying a user
   based on his/her ongoing interactions with a computer. Forensic
   stylometry is the study of linguistic style applied to author (user)
   identification. This paper evaluates the Active Linguistic
   Authentication Dataset, collected from users working individually in an
   office environment over a period of one week. It considers a battery of
   stylometric modalities as a representative collection of high-level
   behavioral biometrics. While a previous study conducted a partial
   evaluation of the dataset with data from fourteen users, this paper
   considers the complete dataset comprising data from 67 users. Another
   significant difference is in the type of evaluation: instead of using
   day-based or data-based (number-of-characters) windows for
   classification, the evaluation employs time-based, overlapping sliding
   windows. This tests the ability to produce authentication decisions
   every 10 to 60 seconds, which is highly applicable to real-world active
   security systems. Sensor evaluation is conducted via cross-validation,
   measuring the false acceptance and false rejection rates (FAR/FRR). The
   results demonstrate that, under realistic settings, stylometric sensors
   perform with considerable effectiveness down to 0/0.5 FAR/FRR for
   decisions produced every 60 seconds and available 95\% of the time.},

   Multimodal biometrics increases the security level accuracy, spoof of

   algorithm is designed by integrating iris, palm print, face and

   and authentication. Multi level wavelet based fusion approach is
   applied, integrated and encoded into single composite image for matching
   decision. It reduces the memory size, increases the recognition accuracy
   and ERR using multimodal biometric approach when compared to individual
   biometric traits. The complexity of fusion and the reconstruction

Title = {Deep Muti-Modal Generic Representation Auxiliary Learning Networks for
   End-to-End Radar Emitter Classification},
Journal = {AEROSPACE},

Abstract = {Radar data mining is the key module for signal analysis, where patterns
   hidden inside of signals are gradually available in the learning process
   and its superiority is significant for enhancing the security of the
   radar emitter classification (REC) system. Owing to the disadvantage
   that radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) caused by the imperfection of
   emitter's hardware is difficult to forge, current deep-learning REC
   methods based on deep-learning techniques, e.g., convolutional neural
   network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) are difficult to capture
   the stable RFF features. In this paper, an online and non-cooperative
   multi-modal generic representation auxiliary learning REC model, namely
   muti-modal generic representation auxiliary learning networks (MGRALN),
   is put forward. Multi-modal means that multi-domain transformations are
   unified to a generic representation. After this, the representation is
   employed to facilitate mining the implicit information inside of the
   signals and to perform the better model robustness, which is achieved by
   using the available generic genenation to guide the network training and
   learning. Online means the learning process of REC is only once and the
   REC is end-to-end. Non-cooperative denotes no demodulation techniques
   are used before the REC task. Experimental results on the measured civil
   aviation radar data demonstrate that the proposed method enables one to
   achieve superior performance.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, most users access internet through mobile applications. The
   common way to authenticate users through websites forms is using
   passwords; while they are efficient procedures, they are subject to
   guessed or forgotten and many other problems. Additional multi modal
   authentication procedures are needed to improve the security. Behavioral
   authentication is a way to authenticate people based on their typing
   behavior. It is used as a second factor authentication technique beside
   the passwords that will strength the authentication effectively.
   Keystroke dynamic rhythm is one of these behavioral authentication
   methods. Keystroke dynamics relies on a combination of features that are
   extracted and processed from typing behavior of users on the touched
   screen and smart mobile users. This Research presents a novel analysis
   in the keystroke dynamic authentication field using two features
   categories: timing and no timing combined features. The proposed model
   achieved lower error rate of false acceptance rate with 0.1\%, false
   rejection rate with 0.8\%, and equal error rate with 0.45\%. A
   comparison in the performance measures is also given for multiple

Title = {Attractiveness of Bike-Sharing Stations from a Multi-Modal Perspective:
   The Role of Objective and Subjective Features},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {When analysing the performance of bike-sharing scheme (BSS) stations, it
   is common to find stations that are located in specific points that
   capture the interest of users, whereas nearby stations are clearly
   underused. This uneven behaviour is not totally understood. This paper
   discusses the potential factors influencing station attractiveness,
   supported by the related literature on cyclists' and pedestrians'
   preferences and the characteristics of the stations themselves. The
   existing literature addresses these topics independently, while this
   work unites them by proposing a non data-extensive methodology that
   allows the attractiveness of BSS stations to be assessed. Attractiveness
   in this context is understood as the set of physical, environmental and
   service-related features of a bike station that make it more appealing
   for BSS users than nearby stations. Special attention is paid to
   differentiating objective features, based on facts, from subjective
   features, those influenced by personal perceptions. This classification
   becomes important in this context because subjective aspects can change
   from one geographical location to another, making the findings related
   to these aspects difficult to apply to other regions. Moreover, the
   assessment of the stations' levels of safety and security is included.
   Thus, the proposed measure of attractiveness of BSS stations provides a
   balanced overview of several features. The consideration of station
   attractiveness when designing BSS layouts will help to refine the design
   of new layouts and will assist in conducting an appropriate diagnostic
   evaluation of the existing ones. This tool will allow urban and
   transportation planners to reduce re-balancing costs and to maximise
   user satisfaction at a low cost, which have a direct impact on improving
   the urban sustainability. The proposed method is applied to the Dublin
   bike sharing scheme, Dublinbikes, with good performance results.},

Title = {Optimization of Innovative Education Resource Allocation in Colleges and
   Universities Based on Cloud Computing and User Privacy Security},
Journal = {WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 28},
Abstract = {It is very important to optimize the allocation of educational
   resources. Affected by big data environment fast development, the
   traditional education work is a huge challenge, a lot of information,
   the rapid spread of a variety of culture makes the college students body
   and mind has been a certain degree of harm, therefore, in the big data
   environment for innovation education resource configuration optimization
   can not only deeply in combination with the new situation, to create a
   new pattern of the education, and to explore new education ideas,
   Moreover, it can fully mobilize students' enthusiasm for learning and
   meet their requirements for innovative education in the environment of
   big data. It is possible to apply computer vision multimodal learning in
   the optimal allocation of innovative education resources in
   universities. At present, the innovative education method is relatively
   simple, and simple teaching videos and text materials can't meet the
   learning needs. Therefore, the multi-modal teaching mode of computer
   vision is needed to evaluate the effect. Based on multi-modal learning
   of computer vision, this article makes a deep discussion on the optimal
   allocation of innovative education resources in universities. This
   article studies the present situation of ideology instructional
   resources construction from the perspectives of the mode of ideology
   instructional resources construction, the overall characteristics and
   classification of educational network resources. Based on this, an
   ideology instructional resource model based on improved collaborative
   filtering algorithm is constructed. At the same time, according to the
   requirement analysis, the overall architecture of the system is
   designed. The framework is built on the JavaEE platform of the system.
   On this basis, the functional modules and databases are designed.
   Finally, the similarity calculation and resource recommendation are
   carried out by combining the interest preference feature model with the
   resource score. The improved algorithm in this article can effectively
   solve the problem of users' cold start and realize the personalized
   recommendation function of innovative education resources. Then promote
   the optimal allocation of innovative education resources in
   universities.},

Title = {Fusion of finger types. for fingerprint indexing using minutiae
   quadruplets},
Journal = {PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {8-14},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Accuracy, security and efficiency are the drivers for exploiting
   multibiometric systems. A multi-modal or multibiometric system is
   relatively more secure than a single-biometric system as a result of the
   rich biometric content, lower error rates and resilience to impostor
   attacks. The availability and easy acquisition of the ten prints of an
   individual with fewer resources, give multi-finger biometric fusion
   scheme an advantage over other fusion schemes based on different
   biometric modalities. In this paper, multi-finger indexing is proposed
   using minutiae quadruplets in combination with a clustering scheme.
   Four, five and ten fingerprints from a subject are fused at the rank
   level using the highest rank rule. The minutiae quadruplet features are
   observed to be robust and the clustering scheme assists in quickly
   identifying a list of potential candidates in the gallery database.
   Results from the experiments show good performance of the fusion scheme
   with minutiae quadruplet features in fingerprint indexing. (C) 2013

Title = {Cross-ethnicity face anti-spoofing recognition challenge: A review},
Journal = {IET BIOMETRICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {24-43},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Face anti-spoofing is critical to prevent face recognition systems from
   a security breach. The biometrics community has achieved impressive
   progress recently due to the excellent performance of deep neural
   networks and the availability of large datasets. Although ethnic bias
   has been verified to severely affect the performance of face recognition
   systems, it still remains an open research problem in face
   anti-spoofing. Recently, a multi-ethnic face anti-spoofing dataset,
   CASIA-SURF cross-ethnicity face anti-spoofing (CeFA), has been released
   with the goal of measuring the ethnic bias. It is the largest up to date
   CeFA dataset covering three ethnicities, three modalities, 1607
   subjects, 2D plus 3D attack types and the first dataset including
   explicit ethnic labels among the recently released datasets for face
   anti-spoofing. We organized the Chalearn Face Anti-spoofing Attack
   Detection Challenge which consists of single-modal (e.g. RGB) and
   multi-modal (e.g. RGB, Depth, infrared) tracks around this novel
   resource to boost research aiming to alleviate the ethnic bias. Both
   tracks have attracted 340 teams in the development stage, and finally,
   11 and eight teams have submitted their codes in the single-modal and
   multi-modal face anti-spoofing recognition challenges, respectively. All
   of the results were verified and re-ran by the organizing team, and the
   results were used for the final ranking. This study presents an overview
   of the challenge, including its design, evaluation protocol and a
   summary of results. We analyse the top-ranked solutions and draw
   conclusions derived from the competition. Besides, we outline future
   work directions.},

   is proper adaptation to and interpretation of events in the sensing area
   of an individual node; another challenge is the integration of
   observations from individual nodes into a common semantic representation
   of the environment. We describe a novel hierarchical architecture
   framework called SENSE (smart embedded network of sensing entities)I to
   meet these challenges. Combining multi-modal sensor information from
   audio and video modalities to gain relevant information about the sensed
   environment, each node recognizes a set of predefined behaviors and
   learns about usual behavior. Neighbor nodes exchange such information to
   confirm unusual observations and establish a global view. Deviations
   from ``normality{''} are reported in a way understandable for human
   operators without special training.},

Abstract = {The ever increasing demand of security has resulted in a wide use of
   Biometrics systems. Despite overcoming the traditional verification
   problems, the unimodal systems suffer from various challenges like intra
   class variation, noise in the sensor data etc, affecting the system
   performance. These problems are effectively handled by the multimodal
   systems. In this paper, we present a multimodal approach for palm and
   finger prints by decision level fusion. The proposed multi-modal system
   is tested on a developed database consisting of 440 palm and finger
   prints each of 55 individuals. In methodology of decision level fusion,
   Directional energy based feature vectors of palm and finger print
   identifiers are compared with their respective databases to generate
   scores based upon which final decisions are made by the individual
   matcher which are combined through Bayesian decision fusion. Receiver
   Operating Characteristics curves are formed for the unimodal and
   multimodal systems. Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.7321\% for decision
   level fusion shows that the multimodal systems significantly
   outperforms. unimodal palm and finger prints identifiers with EER of
   2.822\% and 2.553\% respectively.},

Abstract = {Speaker recognition systems, even though they have been around for four
   decades, have not been widely considered as standalone systems for
   biometric security because of their unacceptably low performance, i.e.,
   high false acceptance and rejection. Research has shown that speaker
   recognition performance can be enhanced through hybrid fusion (HF) of
   likelihood scores generated by arithmetic harmonic sphericity (AHS) and
   hidden Markov model (HMM) techniques {[}1]. Performance improvements of
   22\% and 6\% true acceptance rate (TAR) at 5\% false acceptance rate
   (FAR) were observed, when evaluated on two different datasets- YOHO and
   USF multi-modal biometric dataset respectively. In this paper, we
   present a model that combines accent information from an accent
   classification (AC) system with HF system in order to further increase
   the speaker recognition rate. The proposed system achieved performance
   improvements of 17\% and 15\% TAR at an FAR of 3\% when evaluated on SAA
   and USF datasets. The accent incorporation method discussed in this work
   can also be applied to any other speaker recognition system.},

Abstract = {Biometric recognition is very important for automatically recognizing
   individuals based on feature vectors from behavioral or physiological
   characteristics. The biometric recognition systems provide suitable
   personal recognition approaches for determining individuals. Biometrics
   are broadly employed in several commercial as well as official
   identification systems for automatic access control. This paper
   introduces the model for multi-modal biometric recognition based on the
   feature level fusion method. The overall procedure of the proposed
   method involves four steps: pre-processing, feature extraction,
   recognition feature-level fusion, and Bio-metric recognition. The first
   step is to input the images into pre-processing steps. Thus,
   pre-processing three traits, like face, finger knuckle, and the hand
   vein, is done. Then, the feature extraction is done for each modality to
   extract the features. After that, the feature level fusion is carried
   out using Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) and the proposed Taylor-Grey
   Wolf optimization (Tay-GWO). After feature fusion, the Bio-metric
   recognition is done based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN),
   which Tay-GWO trains. The proposed Tay-GWO is designed by integrating
   the Taylor series and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). The analysis shows
   that the developed model achieves the maximal accuracy of 94.86\%,
   maximal sensitivity of 96.80\%, and specificity of 93.74\%,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {Speech signals carry valuable information about the speaker including
   age, gender, and emotional state. Gender information can act as a vital
   preprocessing ingredient for enhancing speech analysis applications like
   adaptive human machine interfaces, multi-modal security applications,
   and sophisticated intent and context analysis based forensic systems. In
   uncontrolled environments like telephone speech applications, the gender
   recognition system should be adaptive, accurate, and robust to noisy
   environments. This paper presents a reasoning method governed by
   Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence for automatic gender recognition from
   telephone speech. The proposed method uses mel-frequency cepstral
   coefficients with a support vector machine to generate the initial
   prediction results for individual speech segments. The reasoning scheme
   collects and validates results from support vector machine and treats
   convincing predictions as valid evidence. It is argued that the
   consideration of valid evidence in the reasoning process improves
   recognition performance by avoiding unconvincing classification results.
   Experiments conducted on large speech datasets reveal the superiority of
   the proposed gender recognition scheme for speech analysis applications.},

   for the 2022 Beijing winter olympics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {129},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Building a border surveillance system with integrated surveillance
   technologies is a crucial security strategy for Olympic venues. Although
   the previous Olympic Games have a long history of using surveillance
   technologies, there are perennial challenges in terms of false alarms,
   energy consumption, and labor and capital costs. In this paper, an
   IoT-based multi-agent intelligent border surveillance method with less
   cost is proposed. Following a two-level autonomous mechanism, the method
   assures agent-level self-patrolling by distributed nodes and
   system-level multi-agent surveillance task coordination by the central
   server. The core entity of each distributed node is the IoT-based
   SmartGM, an autonomous surveillance tower integrating multi-modal
   surveillance devices. Finally, based on intelligent visual reasoning
   algorithms, the proposed activation strategy updates surveillance
   devices' activation status simultaneously according to global states,
   ensuring long-term operation. This method has been successfully applied
   in the ski venue of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.},

Abstract = {A recent trend of the information technology is cloud computing
   technology where many complex tasks are simplified with increased speed
   and low cost. However, cloud authentication plays a crucial role once
   all the data's are uploaded in the cloud. In this paper, multi-biometric
   template security based on generation of unique graph is proposed to
   ensure a safe and secured cloud authentication mechanism. To overcome
   the vulnerability issues of traditional password and token based
   authentication methods, in this work, a multi-biometric system is
   proposed. The left, right fingerprint and palm print multi modal traits
   are given as input to the system. After preprocessing, all the features
   are combined to generate a weighted graph called as branching factor
   graph. In the end, the node and edge values of the branching factor
   graph will be stored in the cloud database. Experimental study shows
   that the proposed method achieved a very low equal error rate than the
   other existing works.},

Abstract = {This work presents a new weighting algorithm for biometric sources

   the effective and widely used weighted sum fusion rule to produce

   characteristic of the overlap region between the genuine and imposter
   scores distributions. It also integrates the performance of the
   biometric source represented by its equal error rate. This solution aims
   at avoiding the shortcomings of previously proposed solutions such as
   low generalization abilities and sensitiveness to outliers. The proposed
   solution is evaluated along with the state of the art and best practice
   techniques. The evaluation was performed on two databases, the Biometric
   Scores Set BSSR1 and the Extended Multi Modal Verification for
   Tele-services and Security applications database and a satisfying and

Abstract = {As the Internet of Things becomes a reality, proliferation of wireless
   devices such as ZigBee nodes has accelerated. Their presence is now wide
   spread in sensitive areas such as home automation, industrial control
   systems, medical devices and security systems. As their popularity has
   increased, so has the urgency to protect and defend these networks. The
   decentralized nature of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security
   challenges for maintaining network security and intrusion detection.
   RF-fingerprinting provides a unique physical (PHY) layer defense against
   node counterfeiting by identifying rogue devices through their
   RF-emissions. In previous work, feature generation from received RF
   signals was accomplished with parametric variables such as standard
   deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, all based on the assumption
   of a normal distribution of a particular region of interest. We show in
   this work that most collected signals are either multi-modal or
   non-parametric. Use of non-parametric methods for feature generation
   such as mean, median, mode, and trend represented by linear model
   coefficient estimates are shown to be much more applicable to the
   non-parametric distribution of the collected ZigBee preamble, resulting
   in improved classification performance of devices. Non-parametric
   classifier Random Forest is used with both parametric and non-parametric
   features to provide a classification performance comparison. Performance
   improvements of upto 9\% in correct classification rates have been
   achieved and an effective gain of 4 dB SNR was realized.},

Abstract = {Face detection is a common image processing task in applications such as
   pedestrian monitoring, crowd flow prediction, security video
   surveillance, and fever screening. Thermal imaging is used in
   conjunction with a visible light camera for improved monitoring of
   people. Often information from multi-modal sources such as IR/visible
   images is fused for efficient face detection. The accuracy of the face
   detection system relies on the quality of the image registration
   procedure. In this paper, we propose an enhanced intensity-based image
   registration technique for thermal and visible facial images. The method
   uses a histogram matching scheme to equalize the intensity levels of the
   IR/visible images for proper image registration. The proposed scheme
   when validated with facial images shows an improved registration quality
   when quantified using structural similarity (SSIM) and mutual
   information (MI) metric for facial IR and visible images.},

Abstract = {The landside arrival experience of passengers begins on the approaching

   This paper reports on a study using Bluetooth sensors to quantitatively
   evaluate the operations of airport security checkpoints. Bluetooth
   sensors were deployed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport from 30
   August to 13 September, 2010 and collected over 100,000 travel time

   collected. The large volume of this data necessitated the development of
   statistical characterization procedures and graphics that characterize
   both the travel time records and checkpoint information. These
   checkpoint operations reports provide dashboard level reports useful for
   management to rapidly assess operations, and identify opportunities for
   improved allocation of staffing. The paper concludes by providing
   examples of how the checkpoint operations report concept can be extended
   to characterize the movement of traffic through the airport, the entire
   passenger arrival experience, and numerically characterize user delay in
   person-hours. A final overview procedure using pareto sorting to
   identify correctable periods where airports have opportunity to improve
   their utilization is shown.},

Title = {Biometric Information Recognition Using Artificial Intelligence
   Algorithms: A Performance Comparison},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {49167-49183},
Abstract = {Addressing crime detection, cyber security and multi-modal gaze
   estimation in biometric information recognition is challenging. Thus,
   trained artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as Support vector
   machine (SVM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have
   been proposed to recognize distinct and discriminant features of
   biometric information (intrinsic hand features and demographic cues)
   with good classification accuracy. Unfortunately, due to nonlinearity in
   distinct and discriminant features of biometric information, accuracy of
   SVM and ANFIS is reduced. As a result, optimized AI algorithms ((ANFIS)
   with subtractive clustering (ANFIS-SC) and SVM with error correction
   output code (SVM-ECOC)) have shown to be effective for biometric
   information recognition. In this paper, we compare the performance of
   the ANFIS-SC and SVM-ECOC algorithms in their effectiveness at learning
   essential characteristics of intrinsic hand features and demographic
   cues based on Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) feature selection.
   Furthermore, the accuracy of these algorithms are presented, and their
   recognition performances are evaluated by root mean squared error
   (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), scatter index (SI), mean
   absolute deviation (MAD), coefficient of determination (R-2), Akaike's
   Information Criterion (AICc) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency index
   (NSE). Evaluation results show that both SVM-ECOC and ANFIS-SC
   algorithms are suitable for accurately recognizing soft biometric
   information on basis of intrinsic hand measurements and demographic
   cues. Moreover, comparison results demonstrated that ANFIS-SC algorithms
   can provide better recognition accuracy, with RMSE, AICc, MAPE, R-2 and
   NSE values of <= 3.85, 2.39E C02, 0.18\%, >= 0.99 and >= 99,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {With the rapidly growing use of biometric authentication systems, the
   security of these systems and the privacy of users have attracted
   significant attention in recent years. Multi-modal biometrics have been
   able to improve the accuracy of the system but require additional
   bandwidth to exchange the data. Fragile watermarking has been used to
   allow the transmission of both biometric templates using the amount of
   data required to transmit one of them, that is, the cover image, while
   securing these templates against attacks. Despite the high accuracy of
   these systems, communicating such templates imposes risks towards the
   privacy of the users. In this study, a new method is proposed to
   generate fixed-size descriptors for the face and fingerprint templates,
   including the timestamp of the transmission and a unique system
   identifier. The inclusion of the timestamp enables the system to detect
   and deny replay attacks, while the unique system identifier maintains
   the privacy of the users. The experiments conducted to evaluate the
   proposed method have shown that the proposed method has been able to
   achieve these features while maintaining high recognition rates, 99.41\%
   and 99.32\%, similar to the use of the entire biometric templates in the
   matching stage.},

Abstract = {One of the goals of Artificial intelligence (AI) is the realization of
   natural dialogue between humans and machines. in recent years, the
   dialogue systems, also known as interactive conversational systems are
   the fastest growing area in AI. Many companies have used the dialogue
   systems technology to establish various kinds of Virtual Personal
   Assistants(VPAs) based on their applications and areas, such as
   Microsoft's Cortana, Apple's Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and
   Facebook's M. However, in this proposal, we have used the multi- modal
   dialogue systems which process two or more combined user input modes,
   such as speech, image, video, touch, manual gestures, gaze, and head and
   body movement in order to design the NextGeneration of VPAs model. The
   new model of VPAs will be used to increase the interaction between
   humans and the machines by using different technologies, such as gesture
   recognition, image/ video recognition, speech recognition, the vast
   dialogue and conversational knowledge base, and the general knowledge
   base. Moreover, the new VPAs system can be used in other different areas
   of applications, including education assistance, medical assistance,
   robotics and vehicles, disabilities systems, home automation, and

Title = {Binary feature fusion for discriminative and secure multi-biometric
   cryptosystems},
Journal = {IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {254-265},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Biometric cryptosystem has been proven to be a promising approach for
   template protection. Cryptosystems such as fuzzy extractor and fuzzy
   commitment require discriminative and informative binary biometric input
   to offer accurate and secure recognition. In multi-modal biometric
   recognition, binary features can be produced via fusing the real-valued
   unimodal features and binarizing the fused features. However, when the
   extracted features of certain modality are represented in binary and the
   extraction parameters are not known, real-valued features of other
   modalities need to be binarized and the feature fusion needs to be
   carried out at the binary level. In this paper, we propose a binary
   feature fusion method that extracts a set of fused binary features with
   high discriminability (small intra-user and large inter-user variations)
   and entropy (weak dependency among bits and high bit uniformity) from
   multiple sets of binary unimodal features. Unlike existing fusion
   methods that mainly focus on discriminability, the proposed method
   focuses on both feature discriminability and system security: The
   proposed method 1) extracts a set of weakly dependent feature groups
   from the multiple unimodal features; and 2) fuses each group to a bit
   using a mapping that minimizes the intra-user variations and maximizes
   the inter-user variations and uniformity of the fused bit. Experimental
   results on three multi-modal databases show that fused binary feature of
   the proposed method has both higher discriminability and higher entropy
   compared to the unimodal features and the fused features generated from
   the state-of-the-art binary fusion approaches. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel frequency aware robust economic dispatch
   (FARED) approach to exploit the synergistic capability of accommodating
   uncertain loads and renewable generation by accounting for both the
   frequency regulation effect and optimal participation mechanism of
   secondary regulation reserves for conventional units in response to
   uncertainties in the robust optimization counterpart of security
   constrained economic dispatch. The FARED is formulated as a robust
   optimization problem. In this formulation the allowable frequency
   deviation and the possible load or renewable generation curtailments are
   expressed in terms of variable uncertainty sets. The variables in the
   formulation are described as interval variables and treated in affine
   form. In order to improve the computational tractability, the dominant
   constraints which can be the candidates of tight transmission
   constraints are determined by complementarity constraints. Then the
   robust optimization problem is simplified to a bilinear programming
   problem based on duality theory. Finally, the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed method are illustrated based on several study
   cases.},

Abstract = {As the abbreviation for artificial immune system, AIS is an artificial
   intelligence approach newly put forward, which has been widely applied
   to many fields such as data analysis, multi-modal function optimization,
   computer security, error detection, etc. Based on AIS, a novel approach
   was proposed for elevator traffic dynamic zoning with contiguous floors
   during the peak traffic. In this paper, the basic theory of AIS was
   firstly described, then the dynamic zoning model of elevator traffic was
   outlined in detail, and the artificial immune algorithm (AIA) was
   designed for the dynamic zoning model. Comparison was drawn among the
   dynamic zoning based on AIA, static zoning and non-zoning. The
   simulation results demonstrated the feasibility of the approach proposed
   in this paper. Due to its fast convergence, AIA is utilized to quickly
   search the optimal or sub-optimal zoning of elevator traffic, so it is
   adaptive to variable traffic demands.},

   become a significant concern. This has fueled the importance of
   entry-point authentication methods on smartphones. Many entry-point
   authentication methods have failed to offer security due to insider or
   side-channel attacks. This article introduces a sensor-based continuous
   user authentication approach on the smartphone through multi-modal
   behavioral biometrics and a machine learning model to tackle the
   aforementioned issues. The proposed approach captures the touch and
   motion-based behavioral biometrics through the touchscreen and inertial
   sensors of the device. Then, the proposed approach extracts several
   features from captured behavioral data and selects the best set of
   features through a filter-based feature selection technique. Further, we
   implement a nonlinear support vector machine with optimized
   hyperparameters for training and predicting the features to generate the
   scores. We apply score-level fusion on generated scores of several
   sensors to compute the final score for identification of the genuine
   user. In this article, we systematically evaluate the proposed approach
   with the most commonly used behavioral activities of the smartphone user
   in our daily life. The experiment results on all behavioral activities
   show that the proposed approach obtained the best authentication score
   compared to the other machine learning models, and state-of-the-art
   methods. Finally, we conclude our article by addressing the limitations
   of the proposed approach and practical research issues for future
   exploration.},

Abstract = {In this paper a method is proposed for person identification and
   verification The method proposed in Viola and Jones (2001) is used to
   detect the face region in the image The detected face region is
   processed to determine the locations of the eyes and mouth The facial
   and mouth features are extracted relative to the locations of the eyes
   and mouth A new feature called fovea intensity comparison code (FICC) is
   obtained from intensity values of the face/mouth region The dimension of
   the FICC is reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) Euclidean
   distance matching is used for identification and verification The
   performance of the system is evaluated in real time in the laboratory
   environment and the system achieves a recognition rate (RR) of 99 0\%
   and an equal error rate (EER) of about 0 84\% for 50 subjects The
   performance of the system is also evaluated for the eXtended Multi Modal
   Verification for Teleservices and Security (XM2VTS) database and the
   system achieves a recognition rate of 100\% an equal error rate (EER) of

Abstract = {Satellite communication has made great progress in recent years since it
   is characterized by wide information coverage and can support diverse
   types of users, which beneficially fulfills the demand of beyond 5G
   communications. Besides, mobile edge computing (MEC) technologies
   energize the edge devices with computational abilities to deal with the
   majority of training tasks without having to upload to the cloud server,
   which substantially enhances a system's efficiency. In satellite MEC,
   the raw data of edge users vested in different owners cannot be allowed
   to be shared, considering data privacy requirements. To address this,
   federated learning (FL) architecture can be applied to satellite MEC
   where only parameters and model updates can be transmitted, which avoids
   the interaction of raw data from diverse sources. In this article, we
   construct a FL-based satellite MEC architecture, followed by introducing
   its key techniques in the aspects of resource management and multi-modal
   data fusion. Furthermore, we study the data privacy and security
   protection on the FL-aided satellite MEC relying on a blockchain
   framework. Finally, we portray the challenges of FL-aided satellite MEC
   systems.},

Abstract = {With an increase in identity fraud and the emphasis on security, there
   is a growing and urgent need to efficiently identify humans both locally
   and remotely on a routine basis. The appearance of biometric identity
   documents such as passports, visas, national identity cards, drivers'
   licences and health insurance cards, has triggered a real need for
   reliable, user-friendly and widely acceptable automated reference
   mechanisms for checking the identity of an individual. This paper
   presents European perspective in advancing biometrics development as
   identified in the COST 2101 Action ``Biometrics for Identity Documents
   and Smart Cards{''}. The main objective of the Action is to investigate
   novel technologies for unsupervised multi-modal biometric authentication
   systems using a new generation of biometrics-enabled identity documents
   and smart cards, while exploring the added-value of these technologies
   for large-scale applications with respect to the European requirements

Abstract = {With the escalation of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) across
   the globe, shortages in the already scarce medical workforce are
   imminent. Historically, more developed economies have looked abroad to
   augment their health systems. This paper aims to offer plausible
   solutions on how to avert future medical brain drain from sub-Saharan
   Africa (SSA) in the aftermath of COVID-19. We opine that emigration of
   medical workers from low-resource settings to more industrialized
   regions should be viewed by the destination countries as both a moral
   and an ethical issue. Countries in SSA must generally provide good
   leadership, diversify their economies, and ensure adequate security.
   Specifically, there are needs to improve health care workers'
   remuneration, provide more opportunities for specialization, and reduce
   waiting time for employment. It is our opinion that such multisectoral
   and multi-modal approaches will effectively halt and even reverse the
   on-going brain drain in the region, converting it to brain gain.},

Abstract = {Face-spoofing detection plays an important role in ensuring the security
   of face recognition systems. Most multi-modal methods based on deep
   learning improve their accuracy by utilizing information from RGB,
   depth, and infrared. In fact, given the cost and application conditions,
   it is difficult to obtain all these data. Therefore, it is especially
   important to exploit single-modal images to extract more detailed
   information. To address the above problems, we propose an efficient
   two-stream convolutional network, which takes an original image and its
   wavelet-transformed image as input. Then, we design two branches to
   extract the features, with the wavelet branch more conducive to mining
   the detailed information. Finally, we adopt three loss functions to
   supervise the two branches and the fused branch respectively, and each
   branch can be scored separately. The extensive experiments demonstrate
   that our model can achieve satisfactory performance on the datasets,
   with replay-attack and CASIA-FASD achieving 100\% accuracy.},

Abstract = {Biometric Authentication (BA) has turn out to be presently as key
   problem in privacy and security. Multimodal biometric system specializes
   in enhancing verification overall performance of the users for
   authentication. On this direction, biometrics which is the
   computer-based validation of an individuals' identification is turning
   into increasingly more vital, particularly for high security systems.
   The spirit of biometrics is the size of character's behavioral or
   physiological characteristics; it allows authentication of someone's
   identity. Biometric-based totally authentication is likewise turning
   into increasingly more essential in computer based applications because
   the quantity of touchy records saved in such structures is growing. The
   latest needs of biometric systems are robustness, high reputation
   quotes, capability to handle imprecision, uncertainties of
   non-statistical kind and magnanimous flexibility. Its miles precisely
   right here that, the role of soft computing techniques involves vital
   play. The primary aim of this write-up is to offer a practical view on
   applications of soft computing strategies in biometrics and to analyze
   its impact. It is found that soft computing has already made inroads in
   phrases of man or woman techniques or in combination. This paper
   additionally proposes as hybrid soft computing based optimization device
   named ``Adaptive Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (AFGA){''} which is adaptable
   to all of the unimodal and multimodal biometric authentication system.
   The results acquired by means of this device insure high standard of
   verification via multi-modal biometrics fusion by means of powerful
   functionality of fuzzy logic. Experimental investigation under various
   biometric data conditions exhibits notable effects over current

Abstract = {Circular statistics present a new technique to analyse the time patterns
   of events in the field of cyber security. We apply this technique to
   analyse incidents of malware infections detected by network monitoring.
   In particular we are interested in the daily and weekly variations of
   these events.
   Based on ``live{''} data provided by Spamhaus, we examine the hypothesis
   that attacks on four countries are distributed uniformly over 24 hours.
   Specifically, we use Rayleigh and Watson tests. While our results are
   mainly exploratory, we are able to demonstrate that the attacks are not
   uniformly distributed, nor do they follow a Poisson distribution as
   reported in other research. Our objective in this is to identify a
   distribution that can be used to establish risk metrics.
   Moreover, our approach provides a visual overview of the time patterns'
   variation, indicating when attacks are most likely. This will assist
   decision makers in cyber security to allocate resources or estimate the
   cost of system monitoring during high risk periods.
   Our results also reveal that the time patterns are influenced by the
   total number of attacks. Networks subject to a large volume of attacks
   exhibit bimodality while one case, where attacks were at relatively
   lower rate, showed a multi-modal daily variation.},

Abstract = {User recognition is one of the most fundamental functionalities for
   intelligent service robots. However, in robot applications, the
   conditions are far severer compared to the traditional biometric
   security systems. The robots should be able to recognize users
   non-intrusively, which confines the available biometric features to face
   and voice. Also, the robots are expected to recognize users from
   relatively afar, which inevitably deteriorates the accuracy of each
   recognition module.
   In this paper, we tried to improve the overall accuracy by integrating
   the evidences issued by independently developed face and speaker
   recognition modules. Each recognition module exhibits different
   statistical characteristics in representing its confidence of the
   recognition. Therefore, it is essential to transform the evidences to a
   normalized form to integrate the results.
   This paper introduces a novel approach to integrate mutually independent
   multiple evidences to achieve an improved performance. Typical approach
   to this problem is to model the statistical characteristics of the
   evidences by well-known parametric form such as Gaussian. Using
   Mahalanobis distance is a good example. However, the characteristics of
   the evidences often do not fit into the parametric models, which results
   in performance degradation. To overcome this problem, we adopted a
   discrete PDF that can model the statistical characteristics as it is.
   To confirm the validity of the proposed method, we used a multi-modal
   database that consists of 10 registered users and 550 probe data. Each
   probe data contains face image and voice signal. Face and speaker
   recognition modules are applied to generate respective evidences. The
   experiment showed an improvement of 11.27\% in accuracy compared to the
   individual recognizers, which is 2.72\% better than the traditional
   Mahalanobis distance approach.},

Abstract = {Automatic authentication of persons has been an important problem of
   security, and several techniques based on multi-modal biometric
   processing has been developed over the last decade. To provide a
   biometric person authentication system based on human movement signals,
   this paper presents optimal neural network classifiers that are composed
   of local experts to solve the problem of human gender recognition. Two
   ensembles of neural network classifiers have been proposed to
   discriminate the human gender by using the information of moving joints
   of actors. With a database consisting of 13 males' and 13 females'
   movement, and containing 10 repetitions of knocking, waving and lifting
   movements both in neutral and angry style each, we have compared the
   results of ensembles to the conventional classifiers such as single MLP,
   decision tree, self-organizing map and support vector machine.
   Furthermore, the sensitivity has been calculated for the comparison with
   the human performance that has been obtained from the same data. The
   experimental results show that the ensemble models are much superior to
   the conventional classifiers and human subjects.},

Title = {ClickLeak: Keystroke Leaks Through Multimodal Sensors in Cyber-Physical
   Social Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {27311-27321},
Abstract = {Public social environments are hot beds of security leaks, either they
   are virtual or physical. The nature of social settings allows numerous
   people to co-exist in the same space. This close un-bounded proximity
   opens up the possibility of privacy compromise in such environments. In
   this paper, we explore a novel and practical multi-modal side-channel
   keystroke recognition system, named ClickLeak, which can infer the PIN
   code/password entered on numeric keypad by using the commodity Wi-Fi
   devices. Such numeric keypads are commonly available in many public
   social environments. ClickLeak is built on the observation that each key
   input makes unique pattern of hand and finger movements, and this
   generates unique distortions to multi-path Wi-Fi signals. Acceleration
   and microphone sensors of smart phones determine the starting and ending
   time of keystrokes, while the time series of channel state information
   are analyzed to determine the keystrokes. The evaluation results have
   shown that with large scale data collections from public social
   settings, the key recognition accuracy can reach higher than 83\%.},

Abstract = {Biometrics has been gaining attraction due to the ever-growing demand of
   this field of research on access control, public security, forensics and
   e-banking. However, there are still many challenging problems in
   improving the accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and user-friendliness of
   these biometric systems. In this manuscript a new adaptive multi-modal
   biometric framework based on super Self Organizing Maps (super SOM) for
   the recognition of individuals using palm print, ear and face is
   proposed. It is showed that the proposed framework helps to improve the
   performance and robustness of recognition when compared to standard
   methods in literature namely Sequential Float Feature Selection and
   Principal Component Analysis. The major focus of this approach is to
   keep the framework adaptive and robust, thereby, capable of being used
   in a wide variety of environments. Moreover some new directions on which
   super SOM shall be effectively used in biometrics community is also
   discussed. Towards the end, an arity dimensionality concept (inspired
   from biology) which further enhances the efficiency of this framework is
   also used. All the findings are showed with experimental results.},

Abstract = {An emerging urban challenge will be the proliferation of Remotely
   Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) or drones, as their usage grows and
   drones fill the urban skies. Urban airspace will include many more
   Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and related accidents and mishaps
   will also increase. Applications of UAVs in urban environments include
   photography and film-making, security monitoring, real estate,
   construction, property and infrastructure inspections, leisure, public
   safety (fires, natural disasters, investigations), traffic, and much
   more. Emerging UAV applications include last-mile drone delivery
   services. This paper discusses urban scenarios where drones are more
   ubiquitous. Monitoring and related safety of these UAVs will be
   increasingly important. Though multi-modal purpose-built drone tracking
   and monitoring systems will be the most effective solution for detection
   and tracking of these RPAS, during the transition to more regular drone
   use in urban areas and in everyday urban applications, a more
   rapid-deployment and agile detection system is needed that does not
   require installation of hardware. In this paper, sensory substitution is
   presented as an approach to use ambient and pre-existing microphones and
   Al techniques to detect the presence of RPAS. Preliminary results show
   promise for this agile IoT method as a key solution to this emerging
   urban challenge.},

Abstract = {Recently, user authentication has become more important as electronic
   items become part of the Internet of all Things and users own more
   mobile devices. Biometric authentication systems have made a promising
   stride toward reaching the balance of a strong and stress-free
   authentication by using the distinctiveness of the user's
   characteristics to determine valid users. Biometric authentication has
   gained popularity as the system for implicit, non-intrusive and
   progressive authentication because it has no memory load or carry-along
   requirements. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in facial biometrics
   research and we examine facial authentication techniques and the
   emerging usage of multi-modal biometrics such as various combinations of
   periocular, iris and face biometrics to ensure better user security. The
   miniaturization of advanced facial authentication hardware systems into
   mobile devices such as mobile phones and head-mounted displays (HMDs)
   used for VR/ AR/ MR has made biometric authentication seamless. Our
   survey examines facial authentication based on IR LED and multi-spectral
   cameras as they are the most commonly implemented hardware due to their
   multi-functional usage. We examine the possible application of these
   technologies within HMDs and the most recently released mobile phone
   devices on the market.},

Abstract = {With the rapid prevalence of smart mobile devices and the dramatic
   proliferation of mobile applications (Apps), App recommendation becomes
   an emergent task that will benefit different stockholders of mobile App
   ecosystems. However, the extreme sparsity of user-App matrix and many
   newly emerging Apps create severe challenges, causing CF-based methods
   to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. Besides,
   unlike traditional items, Apps have rights to access users' personal
   resources (e.g., location, message and contact) which may lead to
   security risk or privacy leak. Thus, users' choosing of Apps are
   influenced by not only their personal interests but also their privacy
   preferences. Moreover, user privacy preferences vary with App
   categories. In light of the above challenges, we propose a mobile sparse
   additive generative model (Mobi-SAGE) to recommend Apps by considering
   both user interests and category-aware user privacy preferences in this
   paper. To overcome the challenges from data sparsity and cold start,
   Mobi-SAGE exploits both textual and visual content associated with Apps
   to learn multi-view topics for user interest modeling. We collected a
   large-scale and real-world dataset from 360 App store - the biggest
   Android App platform in China, and conducted extensive experiments on
   it. The experimental results demonstrate that our Mobi-SAGE consistently
   and significantly outperforms the other existing state-of-the-art
   methods, which implies the importance of exploiting category aware user
   privacy preferences and the multi-modal App content data on personalized
   App recommendation.},

Abstract = {Currently used in mobile devices PIN-based user authentication cannot
   provide. a sufficient security level. Methods based on multi-modal user
   authentication involving biometrics (i.e. physical and behavioral
   characteristics of a person) may be employed to cope with this problem.
   However, dealing with physical characteristics only, these methods are
   either unable to provide continuous and user-friendly identity
   verification, or are resource consuming.
   In this paper, we aim at the provision of continuous, user-friendly and
   accurate verification of the user identity while preserving scarce
   resources of a mobile device. Rather than physical, behavioral
   characteristics are analyzed. The normal behavior of the user is modeled
   by a set of complementary behavioral aspects that can be used to
   uniquely identify the user. We develop an approach, where these aspects
   are separately monitored by dedicated software-based experts. By
   analyzing the deviations of the current behavior from the modeled one,
   each expert infers separately its decision about the user identity. The
   final decision is derived from these multiple expert decisions by
   applying a decision fusion technique. The monitoring of multiple
   behavioral aspects helps to improve the authentication accuracy and
   enables the continuous verification of the user identity. The
   user-friendliness is supported by the use of transparent authentication
   methods that do not require direct user participation. Finally, the
   analysis of behavioral characteristics and the decision fusion process
   do not involve complicated computational steps and, therefore, are
   conservative in resource consumption.},

Abstract = {The multimodal biometric which is a combination of two or more
   modalities of biometric is able to give more assurance for the
   securities of some systems. Feature level fusion has been shown to
   provide higher-performance accuracy and provide a more secure
   recognition system. In this paper, we propose a feature level fusion of
   face features which are the physical appearance of a person in
   image-based and the online handwritten signature features which are the
   behavioral characteristics of a person in dynamic-based. The problem of
   high dimensionality of the combined features is overcome by the used of
   Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in the feature extraction phase. One
   challenge in multi modal feature level fusion is to maintain the balance
   of the features selected between the two modalities, otherwise one
   modality may outweigh another. In order to address this issue, we
   propose to perform feature fusion in the feature selection phase.
   Feature selection using GA with modified fitness function is applied to
   the concatenated features in order to ensure that only significant and
   most balanced features are used for classification. Comparison of the
   performance of the proposed method with other approaches indicates the
   highest in the recognition accuracy of 97.50\%.},

Abstract = {The efficiency of a biometric system is identified by the detection
   error tradeoff (DET) curve, which is a visual characterization of the
   trade-off between the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and the False
   Rejection Rate (FRR). A DET curve is a plot of FAR against FRR for
   various threshold values, t. FRR refers to the expected probability that
   two mate samples (samples of the same biometric trait obtained from the
   same user) will be falsely declared as a non-match whereas FAR is the
   expected probability that two non-mate samples will be incorrectly
   recognized as a match. The threshold t defines how much the biometric
   characteristics must be similar, in order to make a positive comparison,
   so it measures the correspondence between characteristic to check and
   template stored in the database. By elevating the threshold, the risk
   that not authorized users can fool the system diminishes, but, on the
   other hand, it is more probable that some authorized users can sometimes
   be refused. In this work, we present the results for SpeechXRays
   multi-modal biometric system that uses audio-visual characteristics for
   user authentication in an eHealth platform for osteoarthritis
   management. Using the privacy and security mechanism provided by
   SpeechXrays based on audio and video biometrics medical personnel is
   able to be verified and subsequently identified to the eHealth
   application for osteoarthritis.},

   environment of the Hudson River Estuary. In MSL, this is done through a
   multi-modal interdisciplinary approach. In this paper, underwater
   acoustic measurements and video surveillance are combined. Stevens'
   researchers have developed a specialized prototype video system to
   identify, video-capture, and map surface ships in a sector of the
   estuary. The combination of acoustic noise with video data for different
   kinds of ships in Hudson River enabled estimation of sound attenuation
   in a wide frequency band. Also, it enabled the collection of a noise
   library of various ships that can be used for ship classification by
   passive acoustic methods. Acoustics and video can be used to determine a
   ship's position. This knowledge can be used for ship noise suppression
   in hydrophone arrays in underwater threat detection. Preliminary
   experimental results of position determination are presented in the

Abstract = {Face recognition in real life situations like low illumination condition
   is still an open challenge in biometric security. It is well established
   that the state-of-the-art methods in face recognition provide low
   accuracy in the case of poor illumination. In this work, we propose an
   algorithm for a more robust illumination invariant face recognition
   using a multi-modal approach. We propose a new dataset consisting of
   aligned faces of thermal and visual images of a hundred subjects. We
   then apply face detection on thermal images using the biggest blob
   extraction method and apply them for fusing images of different
   modalities for the purpose of face recognition. An algorithm is proposed
   to implement fusion of thermal and visual images. We reason for why
   relying on only one modality can give erroneous results. We use a
   lighter and faster CNN model called MobileNet for the purpose of face
   recognition with faster inferencing and to be able to use it in real
   time biometric systems. We test our proposed method on our own created
   dataset to show that real-time face recognition on fused images shows
   far better results than using visual or thermal images separately.},

Abstract = {State-of-the-art unmanned ground vehicles are capable of understanding
   and adapting to arbitrary road terrain for navigation. The robotic
   mobility platforms mounted, with sensors detect and report security
   concerns for subsequent action. Often, the information based on the
   localization of the unmanned vehicle is not sufficient for deploying
   army resources. In such a scenario, a three dimensional (3D) map of the
   area that the ground vehicle has surveyed in its trajectory would
   provide apriori spatial knowledge for directing resources in an
   efficient manner. To that end, we propose a mobile, modular imaging
   system that incorporates multi-modal sensors for mapping unstructured
   arbitrary terrain. Our proposed system leverages 3D laser-range sensors,
   video cameras, global positioning systems (GPS) and inertial measurement
   units (IMU) towards the generation of photo-realistic, geometrically
   accurate, geo-referenced 3D terrain models. Based on the summary of the
   state-of-the-art systems, we address the need and hence several
   challenges in the real-time deployment, integration and visualization of
   data from multiple sensors. We document design issues concerning each of
   these sensors and present a simple temporal alignment method to
   integrate multi-sensor data into textured 3D models. These 3D models, in
   addition to serving as apriori for path planning, can also be used in
   simulators that study vehicle-terrain interaction. Furthermore, we show
   our 3D models possessing the required accuracy even for crack detection
   towards road surface inspection in airfields and highways.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a feature extraction method for automatic person
   recognition in video. The method proposed by Viola and Jones (Viola, P.
   and Jones, M., 2001. Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of
   simple features. In: IEEE international conference on computer vision
   and pattern recognition (CVPR 2001), Kauai Marriott, Hawaii, Vol. 1,
   511-518) is used to detect the face region. Face region is processed in
   YCbCr colour space to determine the locations of the eyes. The centre of
   the mouth is determined relative to the locations of the eyes. Facial
   and mouth features are extracted using multiscale morphological erosion
   and dilation operations, respectively. The facial features are extracted
   relative to the locations of the eyes, and mouth features are extracted
   relative to the locations of the eyes and mouth. Fovea intensity
   comparison code and exclusive-OR operation for matching are used to
   recognise a person in video sequences. Projected fovea intensity
   comparison code (PFICC) and Euclidean distance for matching are also
   used to recognise a person in video sequences. The performance of the
   system using PFICC is evaluated in real time in the laboratory
   environment, and the system achieves a recognition rate (RR) of 99.0\%
   and an equal error rate (EER) of about 0.84\% for 50 subjects. The
   performance of the system is also evaluated for the eXtended Multi Modal
   Verification for Teleservices and Security (XM2VTS) database, and the
   system achieves an RR of 100\% and an EER of about 0.23\%.},

   intelligent wearable devices. The universal Internet connectivity of
   such smart objects has brought about a new era of ubiquitous application
   development for the Internet of Things. Meanwhile, security has become
   critically important. In the past decade, academia and industry have
   dedicated great efforts to the design of continuous authentication for
   multi-modal networks. Multiform authentication bio-tokens have been
   introduced for continuous entity identification and verification. With
   the rapid growth and universality of wearable devices, in this article
   we target continuous authentication for the IoT-based environment with
   users possessing wearable healthcare (and wellness) related smart
   objects. To present the state of the art, we provide a comprehensive
   review of continuous authentication in recent years. Critical
   characteristics of new biometrics are then introduced. Second, we
   present a wearable plantar bio-feature extractor constructed via
   commercial pressure sensors and the Raspberry PI platform. The prototype
   is adopted to retrieve user plantar bio-data as the raw (and training)
   data in the proposed authentication system. Third, we apply
   machine-learning-based techniques to derive a user's plantar
   bio-features as authentication tokens in the system to support continual
   (and real-time) entity verification in the background without the user's
   notice.},

Abstract = {Detecting driver's statuses is favorable for reducing the incidence of
   traffic accidents and ensuring driving security. This paper aims to
   develop an efficient system for driving stress detection under real
   driving circumstances. Multiple physiological signals, i.e.,
   electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and respiration
   (RESP) were collected and multi-modal features were extracted from time,
   spectral, and wavelet domains. The proposed approaches are motivated by
   three points: 1) Obvious individual difference affects the
   transferability of trained models to a new drive. Then, through
   dissimilarity evaluation and hierarchical clustering, we searched for
   subgroups of drives that presented relatively consistent feature
   distributions. Performing cross-drive modeling within each subgroup
   enables us to identify driver statuses more precisely with less
   computation cost; 2) fusing the high-dimensional physiological data from
   multiple views is beneficial to achieve a reliable assessment but brings
   new challenges for existing techniques. We adopted Multi-view Intact
   Space Learning (MISL) to integrate rich information from multiple
   perspectives by constructing a latent intact representation of the data;
   3) most of the existing systems are offline. The current study made both
   offline and online analysis to validate the effectiveness of this
   research. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approaches can
   achieve competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods and can be
   developed into intelligent in-vehicle systems to detect driver's
   unfavorable statuses, better adjust their negative affection, and avoid
   traffic accidents.},

Abstract = {New forms of multimedia data (such as text, numbers, tags, networking,
   signals, geo-tagged information, graphs/relationships,
   three-dimensional/VR/AR and sensor data, etc.) have emerged in many
   applications in addition to traditional multimedia data (image, video,
   audio). Multimedia has become the biggest of big data as the foundation
   of today's data-driven discoveries. Almost all disciplines of science
   and engineering, as well as social sciences, involve multimedia data in
   some forms, such as recording experiments, driverless cars, unmanned
   aerial vehicles, smart communities, biomedical instruments, security
   surveillance. Some recent events demonstrate the power of real-time
   broadcast of unfolding events on social networks. Multimedia data is not
   just big in volume, but also multi-modal and mostly unstructured.
   Storing, indexing, searching, integrating, and recognizing from the vast
   amounts of data create unprecedented challenges. Even though significant
   progress has been made processing multimedia data, today's solutions are
   inadequate in handling data from millions of sources simultaneously.
   The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Information Processing
   and Retrieval (IEEE-MIPR) aims to provide a forum for original research
   contributions and practical system design, implementation, and
   applications of multimedia information processing and retrieval for
   single modality or multiple modalities. The target audiences are
   university researchers, scientists, industry practitioners, software
   engineers, and graduate students who want to become acquainted with
   technologies for big data analytics, machine intelligence, information
   fusion in multimedia information processing and retrieval.
   Following a successful debut in Miami, Florida in 2018, the second MIPR,
   held in San Jose, California, attracted over 140 submissions and more
   than 100 attendees-a big growth from its inaugural event and an
   indication of its growing visibility and popularity in the multimedia
   research society. In addition to four keynote talks, MIPR'19 also
   featured six innovation multimedia forums organized by both academic and
   industrial researchers, with topics ranging from computer vision,
   self-driving, Natural Language Processing, next generation video
   display, to cutting edge video/audio coding techniques.},

Abstract = {Video surveillance has become more and more important in many domains
   for their security and safety. Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is one
   of the most interesting subjects in this area. The Re-ID system is
   divided into two main stages: i) extracting feature representations to
   construct a person's appearance signature and establishing the
   correspondence/matching by learning similarity metrics or ranking
   functions. However, appearance based person Re-ID is a challenging task
   due to similarity of human's appearance and visual ambiguities across
   different cameras. This paper provides a representation of the
   appearance descriptors, called signatures, for multi-shot Re-ID. First,
   we will present the tracklets, i.e trajectories of persons. Then, we
   compute the signature and represent it based on the approach of Part
   Appearance Mixture (PAM). An evaluation of the quality of this signature
   representation is also described in order to essentially solve the
   problems of high variance in a person's appearance, occlusions,
   illumination changes and person's orientation/pose. To deal with
   variance in a person's appearance, we represent it as a set of
   multi-modal feature distributions modeled by Gaussian Mixture Model
   (GMM). Experiments and results on two public datasets and on our own
   dataset show good performance.},

Abstract = {Stimuli-responsive phosphorescence materials with dynamic color-changing
   properties are highly promising for advanced information security.
   Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy that effectively induces tunable
   dynamic phosphorescence color from carbon dots (CDs) on papers via
   surface ionization engineering for multimode encryption and information
   storage. Alkali-induced phenolic hydroxyl ionization on CDs can boost
   intersystem crossing rates, while surface-ionized groups with negative
   charges significantly passivate the surface defects and reduce
   non-radiative transitions, which can activate surface state-related blue
   phosphorescence emission. Combined with the carbon core state-related
   yellow green phosphorescence, excitation/time-dependent phosphorescence
   color-changing from yellow-green to blue are realized from alkali
   (Na2CO3) treated CDs on paper. Furthermore, benefiting from the
   transition from NaHCO3 to Na2CO3 under thermal treatment, dynamic
   color-changing phosphorescence can also be activated by thermally
   stimulating NaHCO3-treated CDs on paper. Finally, multi-stimuli (alkali
   or thermal) and multi-modal dynamic phosphorescent colors from a single
   CDs system are realized for the first time. Based on these unique
   features, multimode encryption and smart 3D codes with anti
   counterfeiting and monitoring functions for medicine during transport or
   storage are demonstrated by combining an inkjet printing technique using
   CD inks. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The scope and applicability of detecting gamma-emitting materials by
   first responders and advanced searchers have changed considerably over
   the last 15 years. More often than not the searchers are being asked to
   obtain an image of the gamma sources that are shielded or otherwise
   inaccessible. They are constantly being tasked to localize a moving
   source in busy traffic. Commercially available gamma detection units and
   prototype Government-funded research products use complex techniques
   such as hybrid imaging processes (combination of traditional Compton
   imaging with coded aperture masks, for example, modified uniformly
   redundant array {[}MURA] patterns). Standalone radiation detection
   systems are increasingly capitalizing on multi-modal detection,
   emphasizing on data fusion, informatics, and novel signal/signature
   exploitations.
   At the request of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
   Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office, previously known
   as the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), a study committee from
   the American Physical Society has recommended that emphasis is kept on
   the ability to detect shielded special nuclear material with high
   sensitivity and reliability. Development of new and improved detection
   algorithms ( e.g., principal component analysis, maximum-likelihood
   estimation algorithm, and others) has been encouraged. CWMD has been
   urged to focus on signature identification in its nuclear forensic
   portfolio. Newer materials like SrI3:Eu2+, LaBr3:Ce, CeBr3:Ca2+ with
   fast rise time and short decay time of gamma pulses, high intrinsic
   gamma sensitivity, high gamma energy resolution, and high-efficiency
   conversion of excitation energy to fluorescent radiation are constantly
   being sought to build gamma detectors. Neutron detection and associated
   activation analysis using a gamma ray detection system is highly
   encouraged.
   There is a constant demand for miniaturization of gamma radiation
   detection system for tactical usage in the field- the most sought-after
   device must be lightweight, easy to use, should be able to withstand
   harsh environmental conditions, long shelf life with commensurate long
   battery life, high sensitivity (with preferably high resolution),
   capable of creating flexible and configurable alarm conditions with
   directional sensitivity. This array of technical constraints demands
   stringent specifications on the readout electronics, data acquisition
   technologies, interoperability and interconnectivity of data output and
   strict quality assurance of the detection and measurement devices.
   In recent years the CWMD has developed a system called Intelligent
   Radiation Sensing System (IRSS) that harnesses the information gathered
   by ubiquitous radiation monitoring systems deployed by the state, local,
   and tribal law enforcement organizers {[}1]. The IRSS was created to
   better equip law enforcement entities to protect large cities from the
   threats and harmful effects of nuclear or radiological incidents and
   emergencies. The IRSS uses a breakthrough technology that networks a
   group of portable radiation detectors with improved detection,
   localization, and identification of potential radiological threat. The
   program created a robust, flexible network architecture along with
   advanced data fusion algorithms that combine information from many
   detectors.
   A study {[}2] published in the Journal of Materials Research summarized
   the basic requirements for materials to be used in development of
   scalable radiation detection systems that considered the critical
   material performance metrics of energy resolution (1\% for
   semiconductors like CZT, <3\% for scintillators like LaBr3:Ce at 662 keV
   primary gamma ray energy from Cs-137 isotope), fast timing including
   high mobility of electrons and holes in the semiconductors and fast
   scintillation processes, high spatial resolution for imaging purposes,
   high intrinsic detection efficiency (requiring high density, high
   effective atomic number Z(eff)), high geometric efficiency achieved
   sometimes by occlusion processes, neutron detection efficiency and
   operational factors like cost, ease of use, use of peripheral equipment
   like thermomechanical engines to stabilize the detection systems.
   Exciting new research and development work utilizing effective data
   mining algorithms is being performed at universities, national
   laboratories, and commercial institutions in gamma ray detection
   technology. For example, gamma ray imaging techniques first used in
   space telescopes are being applied in modern security and health systems
   in a joint project between the University of Southampton and industrial
   partner Symetrica. The project aims to develop a new coded aperture
   imaging system that could inspire a new generation of ``stand-off{''}
   imaging systems. These systems would allow for remote inspection for
   radioactive materials.
   This review article intends to capture the synergy of international
   commercial collaborations exemplified by the United States Defense
   Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA's) SIGMA program in which
   detector expertise originating from the United Kingdom (Kromek Group
   plc.) algorithm development and system modelling and analysis developed
   by United States national laboratories came together under the general
   guidance provided by a small commercial unit, Invincea Labs, in the area
   of network algorithm integration and development.},

Title = {A review of state-of-the-art in Face Presentation Attack Detection: From
   early development to advanced deep learning and multi-modal fusion
   methods},
Journal = {INFORMATION FUSION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {75},
Pages = {55-69},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Face Recognition is considered one of the most common biometric
   solutions these days and is widely used across a range of devices for
   various security purposes. The performance of FR systems has improved by
   orders of magnitude over the past decade. This is mainly due to the
   latest developments in computer vision and deep convolutional neural
   networks, and the availability of large training datasets. At the same
   time, these systems have been subject to various types of attacks.
   Presentation attacks are common, simple, and easy to implement. These
   simply involve presenting a video, photo, or mask to the camera or
   digital sensor and have proven capable of fooling FR systems and
   providing access to unauthorised users. Presentation attack detection is
   increasingly attracting more attention in the research community. A wide
   range of methods has already been developed to address this challenge.
   Deep learning-based methods in particular have shown very promising
   results. However, existing literature suggests that even with
   state-of-the-art methods, performance drops significantly in
   cross-dataset evaluation. We present a thorough, comprehensive, and
   technical review of existing literature on this timely and challenging
   problem. We first introduce and discuss the presentation attack problem
   and cover related and recent work in this area. In-depth technical
   details of existing presentation attack detection methods are then
   presented and critically discussed and evaluated, followed by a
   comprehensive discussion and evaluation of existing public datasets and
   commonly used evaluation metrics. Our review shows clearly that despite
   the recent and significant advances in this area of research, detecting
   unseen attacks is still considered a key problem. Machine learning
   methods tend to perform well, but only when test data comes from the
   same distribution as the training data (i.e. same dataset). New research
   directions are discussed in detail, including ways to improve the
   generalisation of machine learning methods, and move towards creating
   more stable presentation attack detection techniques that generalise
   across a wide range of unseen samples.},

Title = {Building power consumption datasets: Survey, taxonomy and future
   directions},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {227},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {In the last decade, extended efforts have been poured into energy
   efficiency. Several energy consumption datasets were henceforth
   published, with each dataset varying in properties, uses and
   limitations. For instance, building energy consumption patterns are
   sourced from several sources, including ambient conditions, user
   occupancy, weather conditions and consumer preferences. Thus, a proper
   understanding of the available datasets will result in a strong basis
   for improving energy efficiency. Starting from the necessity of a
   comprehensive review of existing databases, this work is proposed to
   survey, study and visualize the numerical and methodological nature of
   building energy consumption datasets. A total of thirty-one databases
   are examined and compared in terms of several features, such as the
   geographical location, period of collection, number of monitored
   households, sampling rate of collected data, number of sub-metered
   appliances, extracted features and release date. Furthermore, data
   collection platforms and related modules for data transmission, data
   storage and privacy concerns used in different datasets are also
   analyzed and compared. Based on the analytical study, a novel dataset
   has been presented, namely Qatar university dataset, which is an
   annotated power consumption anomaly detection dataset. The latter will
   be very useful for testing and training anomaly detection algorithms,
   and hence reducing wasted energy. Moving forward, a set of
   recommendations is derived to improve datasets collection, such as the
   adoption of multi-modal data collection, smart Internet of things data
   collection, low-cost hardware platforms and privacy and security
   mechanisms. In addition, future directions to improve datasets
   exploitation and utilization are identified, including the use of novel
   machine learning solutions, innovative visualization tools and
   explainable mobile recommender systems. Accordingly, a novel
   visualization strategy based on using power consumption micro-moments
   has been presented along with an example of deploying machine learning
   algorithms to classify the micro-moment classes and identify anomalous
   power usage. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Palm and hand vein-based fuzzy vault generation scheme for

Abstract = {Template security of biometric systems is a vital issue and needs
   critical focus. The importance lies in the fact that unlike passwords,
   stolen biometric templates cannot be revoked. Hence, the biometric
   templates cannot be stored in plain format and needs strong protection
   against any forgery. In this paper, we present a technique to generate
   face and palm vein-based fuzzy vault for multi-biometric cryptosystem.
   Here, initially the input images are pre-processed using various
   processes to make images fit for further processing. In our proposed
   method, the features are extracted from the processed hand and palm vein
   images by finding out unique common points. The chaff points are added
   to the already extracted points to obtain the combined feature vector.
   The secret key points which are generated based on the user key input
   (by using proposed method) are added to the combined feature vector to
   have the fuzzy vault. For decoding, the multi-modal biometric template
   from palm vein and hand vein image is constructed and is combined with
   the stored fuzzy vault to generate the final key. Finally, the
   experimentation is conducted using the palm vein and hand vein database.
   The evaluation metrics employed are FMR (False Match Ratio) and GMR
   (Genuine Match Ratio). From the metric values obtained for the proposed
   system, we can infer that the system has performed well. The results are
   also compared to our earlier technique and the results shows that the
   proposed technique has achieved better results having GAR of 94\%
   without noise and 88\% with noise.},

Abstract = {Previous research has highlighted that all data security systems rest on
   the assumption of accurate user verification. Although much research has
   focused on speech and keystroke characteristics, no study has examined
   the potential of indirect cursor control devices, such as mouse or pen,
   as a means of personal user verification. This paper presents the result
   of an exploratory examination of the measurement of individual users'
   behaviour elicited while using two indirect input devices (puck and
   pen). Ten subjects undertook two series of 500 trials using the puck and
   pen in a counterbalanced design. Each trial involved guiding the cursor
   to one of ten possible targets, projected upon one of five angles of
   projection and one of two distances. Data recorded comprised a series of
   (x,y) coordinates and associated time stamps of each component of the
   movement. Five parameters for each full movement were extracted--total
   time to reach the target, maximum velocity of the movement, maximum
   acceleration for the movement, time to maximum velocity of movement,
   time to maximum acceleration of the movement. Results of a series of
   Multivariate Analyses of Variance indicated that for both the puck and
   the pen data, there were statistically significant differences between
   subjects for each of the five parameters. This set of discriminating
   parameters was then embedded in a verification paradigm. Results
   indicated that the average error rates varied between 39\% (S.D. = 2\%)
   and 14\% (S.D. = 2\%) for the puck and 38\% (S.D. = 2\%) and 12\% (S.D.
   = 2\%) for the pen. Error rates were dependent upon the number of
   samples used when making the verification decision. This research
   suggests that pointing device measurements using the current parameters
   are not a viable method of user verification by themselves. However,
   with average error rates as low as 12\%, it may be reasonable to
   integrate them into a multi-modal security system. Practical
   implications and future research directions are discussed. (C) 1996

Abstract = {Millions of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS), or drones weighing
   less than 55 pounds, will fly in urban airspaces within a decade. This
   is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger
   transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service
   and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A
   significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this
   extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone
   shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to
   larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation
   (GA). Robust and resilient detection, identification, localization, and
   tracking of sUAS sharing UAM airspace is complicated by urban factors
   such as non-transmitting, non-cooperative drones. Exacerbating these
   challenges, current technological limitations and vulnerabilities in
   Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Dependent
   Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)
   can pose safety and security threats. To streamline a vision of safe and
   secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace, we propose Drone Net, a UAS Traffic
   Management (UTM) network of multi-modal ground and flight instruments.
   Drone Net is an architecture fusing a network of passive visual and
   acoustic sensor nodes with active Radio Detection and Ranging (radar)
   and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensing methods for UTM,
   designed for integration with existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and
   future UAM systems. The purpose of the Drone Net system is to evaluate
   use of Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic arrays networked
   within an urban UAS operating region such as uncontrolled Class-G and
   waivergranted Class-D airspace. The Drone Net approach combines
   detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADSB, and
   EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and
   spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design
   allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight
   platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR
   to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that
   a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and
   fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop
   sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe,
   fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization
   with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network.
   Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and
   registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS
   that are both compliant and noncompliant alongside GA and UAM more
   safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we
   envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can
   emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery
   using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to
   safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of
   Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered
   aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with
   fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more
   advanced scenarios between multiple UAS.
   The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional
   and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous
   information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone
   detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a
   single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net
   project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data
   sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time
   for analysis and security applications. More concrete applications for
   Drone Net include UTM integration with ATC and UAM, but also airspace
   safety and security for campus and public venues in general. Herein, we
   will present our experimental design and current test data from
   Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in collaboration with University of
   Colorado Boulder toward completing the open specification for ground and
   flight instruments. We would additionally like to invite others to
   participate in growing the network and the data available for UTM, UAM,
   and GA shared airspace research.},

   resource-poor sensors combined into loosely coherent sensor arrays that
   perform in situ detection, estimation, compression, and exfiltration. We
   ground our study in the context of a security scenario called ``A Line
   in the Sand{''} and accordingly define the target, system, environment,
   and fault models. Based on the performance requirements of the scenario
   and the sensing, communication, energy, and computation ability of the
   sensor network, we explore the design space of sensors, signal
   processing algorithms, communications, networking, and middleware
   services. We introduce the influence field, which can be estimated from
   a network of binary sensors, as the basis for a novel classifier. A
   contribution of our work is that we do not assume a reliable network; on
   the contrary, we quantitatively analyze the effects of network
   unreliability on application performance. Our work includes multiple
   experimental deployments of over 90 sensor nodes at MacDill Air Force
   Base in Tampa, FL, as well as other field experiments of comparable
   scale. Based on these experiences, we identify a set of key lessons and
   articulate a few of the challenges facing extreme scaling to tens or
   hundreds of thousands of sensor nodes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {RMOBF-Net: Network for the Restoration of Motion and Optical Blurred
   Finger-Vein Images for Improving Recognition Accuracy},
Journal = {MATHEMATICS},

Abstract = {Biometrics is a method of recognizing a person based on one or more
   unique physical and behavioral characteristics. Since each person has a
   different structure and shape, it is highly secure and more convenient
   than the existing security system. Among various biometric
   authentication methods, finger-vein recognition has advantages in that
   it is difficult to forge because a finger-vein exists inside one's
   finger and high user convenience because it uses a non-invasive device.
   However, motion and optical blur may occur for some reasons such as
   finger movement and camera defocusing during finger-vein recognition,
   and such blurring occurrences may increase finger-vein recognition
   error. However, there has been no research on finger-vein recognition
   considering both motion and optical blur. Therefore, in this study, we
   propose a new method for increasing finger-vein recognition accuracy
   based on a network for the restoration of motion and optical blurring in
   a finger-vein image (RMOBF-Net). Our proposed network continuously
   maintains features that can be utilized during motion and optical blur
   restoration by actively using residual blocks and feature concatenation.
   Also, the architecture RMOBF-Net is optimized to the finger-vein image
   domain. Experimental results are based on two open datasets, the
   Shandong University homologous multi-modal traits finger-vein database
   and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University finger-image database version
   1, from which equal error rates of finger-vein recognition accuracy of
   4.290-5.779\% and 2.465-6.663\% were obtained, respectively. Higher
   performance was obtained from the proposed method compared with that of
   state-of-the-art methods.},

Abstract = {Agriculture is a major user of ground and surface water, accounting for
   similar to 70\% of the world's freshwater withdrawals. The rising
   agricultural water demand potentially leads to a conflict with water use
   among urban, industrial and agricultural sectors. It also threatens food
   security, human life and the environment worldwide. The urgent need for
   alternative water resources motivates the exploration of atmospheric
   water as an abundant and untapped source of freshwater for irrigated
   agriculture. Herein, kelp-derived hydrogel beads with self-contained
   properties (i.e., hygroscopic, photothermal, temperature-responsive and
   durable) are developed via shape-controlled and mass fabrication. The
   hygroscopic beads attain maximum water uptake of over 5.0 g g(-1) under
   90\% relative humidity (RH). Synergistic photothermal heating and
   temperature-driven phase transition afford multi-modal water desorption
   and efficient water release. Over 95\% of absorbed water can be rapidly
   released under a broad solar intensity of 0.6-1 sun and temperature
   range of 40-60 degrees C. A solar-powered and sorption-based seed
   propagator is developed and demonstrated to sustain the plant
   germination and growth, taking the advantages of the hydrogel beads'
   reversible moisture sorption/desorption in night/day cycles, the high
   quality of irrigation water, net-zero energy consumption and thermal
   management in a system-level design. This work provides a perspective on
   controlled and mass fabrication of hygroscopic hydrogels. It highlights
   the solar-powered atmospheric water irrigation for electricity-free and
   sustainable agriculture regardless of varied geographical and hydrologic
   conditions.},

Title = {SINT: Toward a Blockchain-Based Secure In-Band Network Telemetry
   Architecture},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {2667-2682},
Abstract = {The foundation of network management is to timely, accurately, and
   flexibly monitor the status of a managed network. Recently, In-band
   Network Telemetry (INT) has presented its unique capabilities in
   acquiring the insights of a network and thus has been adopted in many
   production networks. However, less attention was put on the potential
   threats on INT (e.g., the man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojan horse
   injection) that may falsify network measurements resulting in
   catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose a secure INT
   architecture called SINT that can effectively mitigate INT
   vulnerabilities and can be implemented using `chiplet' based multi-modal
   network processors (MNP). SINT adopts blockchain technology into INT, in
   which a network status snapshot acquired via INT is viewed as a block
   and added into a network telemetry blockchain to prevent arbitrary
   access and malicious modification. To minimize the intrusiveness of the
   INT and blockchain operations, SINT is designed to be a lightweight
   protocol and uses improved RAFT consensus mechanisms to reduce its
   network and computing overhead. The design of the chiplet MNP system
   makes SINT highly flexible and adaptive to facilitate INT convergence
   and related blockchain updates. In the SINT architecture, INT tasks and
   blockchain operations are dispatched to different chips to achieve an
   optimal trade-off among measurement accuracy, security requirements, and
   computing resource on the data plane. Experiments and simulations show
   that SINT can alleviate most cyberattacks on INT and retain 97\% of
   bandwidth utilization for other users' normal traffic in a complex
   scenario with 500 nodes. Furthermore, SINT converges the INT results
   quickly and accurately with minor overhead compared to that of the
   state-of-art INT methods.},

Title = {Communication Requirements in Microgrids: A Practical Survey},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {47694-47712},
Abstract = {Progress in Microgrid (MG) research has evolved the MG concept from
   classical, purely MG power networks to more advanced power and
   communications networks. The communications infrastructure helps control
   and manage the unreliable power outputs that most standard power
   generation elements of the MG (e.g., wind turbines and photo-voltaic
   panels) deliver. Although communication technologies do offer certain
   advantages for sensing and control, they generate other complications
   due to packet loss and packet latency, among other transmission
   impairments. In this work, we discuss the impact of communications on MG
   performance, establishing the requirements of data exchanges and system
   response in the three levels of a hierarchical control approach:
   primary, secondary, and tertiary. With a focus on the secondary level -
   responsible for ensuring the restoration of electrical parameters - we
   identify standards, networking protocols, and communication technologies
   relevant for the interoperability of MGs and clusters of MGs, including
   both modes of operation: isolated and grid-connected. We review
   theoretical approaches and practical implementations that consider the
   effects of the communications network on the general performance of the
   MG. Moreover, we undertake an experimental analysis of the influence of
   wired and wireless communication networks on MG performance, revealing
   the importance of designing future smart control solutions more robust
   to communication degradation, especially if wireless technologies are
   integrated to provide scalable deployments. Aspects such as resilience,
   security, and interoperability are also shown to require continuing
   efforts in research and practical applications.},

Abstract = {The world has changed dramatically since the Cold War when there were
   two super powers. Then, it was relatively simple to identify our
   intelligence collection targets. It was sometimes hard to collect the
   intelligence, but the targets were clear. Today we live in a world of
   asymmetries. The most serious asymmetric threat facing the United States
   today is terrorism; a threat characterized by collections of loosely
   organized people who operate in shadowy networks that are difficult to
   identify and define and whose goal is the destruction of our way of
   life. The intelligence collection targets are thousands of people whose
   identities and whereabouts we do not always know.
   If we are to preserve our national security, we must figure out a way of
   combating this threat. The solution is largely associated with
   information technology. We must become much more efficient and clever in
   the ways we use existing sources of data to find new sources of data,
   mine it for new information, generate context relevant information, make
   it widely available for collaborative analysis, convert it to knowledge
   and create actionable options for senior decision-makers. Also. we need
   a more systemic approach to the problem. A variety of tools, processes
   and procedures will be required to deal with this problem, however, to
   be effective, they must be integrated and harmonized within a system
   context built around a common architecture.
   In this paper, we will provide a broad overview of the Total Information
   Awareness (TIA) program - a new counter terrorism initiative sponsored
   by the Information Awareness Office (IAO) at the Defense Advanced
   Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The TIA program will develop and
   integrate a variety of information technologies enabling early warning
   and understanding of terrorist activities and ultimately the preemption
   of terrorist attacks through collaborative decision making at the
   national security level. Examples of some of the key technologies needed
   for TIA include: entity and event detection and extraction, link
   discovery and pattern learning across space and time, human language
   exploitation including summarization and translation, biometrics and
   multi-modal techniques for human identification, various methods for
   privacy protection and policy formulation, and several prediction and
   estimation approaches to understand individual and group behavior and
   intent. TIA will also require concepts and methods for bringing users
   with diverse points of view together in a collaborative problem-solving
   environment, where they can have access to their relevant data sources,
   the use of discovery tools and the ability to exploit and quickly
   generate models for structured arguments that facilitate the
   presentation and vetting of competing hypotheses.},

Abstract = {Aerial radiological search and survey missions have been performed by
   the United States Department of Energy's (USDOE) Remote Sensing
   Laboratory for over 40 years. Originally created in 1967 as Aerial
   Measurement Operations, the Aerial Measuring System ( AMS) mission has
   expanded to include acquiring baseline measurements, performing periodic
   site monitoring, and responding to radiological emergencies. In an
   accident scenario, AMS fixedwing and/or rotary-wing systems can be
   deployed to map radiological deposition. The aircraft are equipped to
   detect and measure radioactive contamination on the ground. The AMS has
   a sophisticated radiation detection system to gather radiological
   information and store it on the cloud using the Advanced Visualization
   and Integration of Data (AVID) platform or on local computers. This
   large amount of radiation monitoring data is later used to define and
   implement public protective guidance.
   Aerial radiation measurements have proven to be very effective in
   support of responses to nuclear or radiological emergencies resulting in
   the dispersal of radioactive material over a large area {[}viz.
   Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear power plant measurements done through March
   and April 2011] {[}1]. Right after the Fukushima accident, US aerial
   missions flew 85 flights over 500 hours, covering more than 10,000
   square kilometres from the power plant to an 80 km radius to create a
   common operating picture of the extent of the gamma-emitting
   radionuclides and the footprint of the deposition from multiple
   releases.
   In order to be effective, the aerial measurements must be performed with
   a system that will collect the data in sufficient detail and quality to
   support the needs of emergency responders. This paper briefly outlines
   the technical specifications and functions of a system to be used on an
   aerial platform (airplane or helicopter) to measure widespread
   radioactive material (radioactive contamination). The information
   contained within this paper is intended to help ensure that measurements
   conducted by multiple AMSs are both technically compatible and
   comparable with each other and with measurements taken on the ground.
   Recently AMS has acquired newer and faster aircraft with
   longer-than-before ranges to deploy radiation monitoring equipment. This
   article defines and provides guidance for using the US DOE/NNSA's new
   aerial measurement platforms with multi-fold return of the investment in
   mind. The guidance involves technical innovation and optimized use of
   the platforms and collaboration with other stakeholders like the
   Department of Homeland Security, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and
   the Environmental Protection Agency. The guidance recommends AMS to
   reposition itself as a valid and credentialed data provider to other
   relevant and recognized stakeholders in the area of chemical,
   biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives threats. It recommends
   critical application expansion for AVID to analyse multi-modal data
   including hyperspectral, infrared, and radiological data through data
   fusion.},
