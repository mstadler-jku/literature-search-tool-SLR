However, it is not yet clear how to build security requirements. This paper describes and illustrates a process to build application specific security requirements from state transition diagrams at the security threat location. Using security failure data, we identify security threat locations which attackers could use to exploit software vulnerabilities. A state transition diagram is constructed to be used to protect, mitigate, and remove vulnerabilities relative to security threat locations. In the software development process, security requirements are obtained from state transition diagrams relative to the security threat location.","","International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security, Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA, DEC 15-19, 2005","Seo, SC (Corresponding Author), Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 300 Yongbong Dong, Kwangju 500757, South Korea.

This paper presents a state transition model to describe the dynamic behavior of intrusion tolerant systems. This model provides a framework from which we can define the vulnerability, and the threat set to be addressed.

It also goes without saying that this approach to computing shares its own challenges the most echoed being security. Security concerns herein, birthed by the exposure of the cloud to different threats, continue to cast doubts on potential users and it's only befitting that such concerns are addressed. Users who entrust their data to the cloud want their data to be secured in the strongest terms possible. Once data leaves the user, the onus is on the cloud provider to provide the required security since data now lies within their perimeter of jurisdiction. But security requirements do change with time and this therefore calls for a continuous process of evaluating the security status of the cloud system. This paper proposes a model of analyzing the security status of the cloud system with regards confidentiality, integrity and availability. We employ state transitions of a conceptual finite state machine, Boolean algebra and logic to evaluate the various states of the system when a specified breach occurs. The scope of this paper is limited to user data on the cloud and not as it traverses the network between the user and the provider.","cloud computing; threats; state transitions; Boolean logic","1st IEEE International Conference on Computer Communication and the Internet (ICCCI), Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA, OCT 13-15, 2016","Zimba, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.

By taking the impact of rescheduling under contingencies into consideration, reliability-constrained unit commitment (RCUC) is developed to address this challenge. Although several efforts have been made in modelling reliability constraints, the existing methods can only manage oversimplified low-order temporal-independent contingencies without considering wide-range contingencies or their state-transition-process issue. To quantify the impact of rescheduling on the normal-state scheduling process denoted by UC problem, this paper builds up a Bayesian inference method for encoding reliability constraints in wide-range temporal-dependent contingencies. Three predictors, for example, expected-generator-rescheduling-power, expected-energy-not-serviced and lost-of-load-probability, are selected to describe the possible corrective behaviours in rescheduling process and quantified by using Bayesian inference method. Then, these predictors are reformatted as a set of linearized constraints to be incorporated into UC. The proposed RCUC comprehensively considers the effect of rescheduling in wide-range temporal-dependent contingencies. Therefore, it can reveal the influence of generator rescheduling in wide-range contingencies and keep better reliability performance than those methods reported in previous RCUC studies. The modified IEEE 30-bus test system and IEEE 118-bus test system are used to show the proposed model's effectiveness.","","","Zhang, Y (Corresponding Author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.

Instead of simply combining rule comparison and counting number of SIP messages, we develop secure RFC 3261 rules based on existing RFC 3261 rules, so that proposed mechanism shows 26% higher detection rate for malformed attack.

In this paper, we provide a declarative semantics for SMP through a translation from SMP to Answer Set Programming (ASP). We show that our translation is sound and complete for bounded SMP reasoning. With this translation, we are able not only to directly compute users' authorization query answers, but also to specifically extract information of how users' authorization states change in relation to the underlying query answering. In this way, we eventually avoid SMP's tedious proof system and significantly simply the SMP reasoning process. Furthermore, we argue that the proposed ASP translation of SMP also provides a flexibility to enhance SMP's capacity for accommodating more complex authorization reasoning problems that the current SMP lacks.","Access control; Authorization policies; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Logic programming; State change","28th International Conference on Industrial, Engineering and Other Applications of Applied Intelligent Systems (IEA/AIE), Seoul, SOUTH KOREA, JUN 10-12, 2015","Bai, Y (Corresponding Author), Univ Western Sydney, Artificial Intelligence Res Grp, Sch Comp Engn & Math, South Penrith, Australia.

The clutch is a key actuator for mode transition, but friction resulting from its use makes it difficult to achieve seamless mode transition. Moreover, as is usual in an electromechanical coupling system, the hybrid powertrain may exhibit complex dynamic behaviours as operating parameters change during mode transition. This paper considered changes in the clutch friction coefficient, and established a mathematical model of the hybrid powertrain in a parallel-series hybrid electric vehicle (PSHEV) during mode transition. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion and bifurcation theory are introduced to analyse the influence of speed difference on the dynamic characteristics of the hybrid powertrain, and the corresponding instability threshold were given. Furthermore, an optimised adaptive control methodology was proposed to control the dynamic behaviours, and tests on PSHEV were carried out. The results show that the variations of speed difference may lead to the occurrence of Fold and Hopf bifurcations, and that once the speed difference reaches the instability threshold, it may cause the system to enter a chaotic state and exhibit random oscillation. The proposed control methodology can effectively expand the security domain and suppress the oscillation to improve smoothness of mode transition.","Hybrid electric vehicle; mode transition; clutch engagement; dynamic characteristics; security domain; adaptive control","","He, R (Corresponding Author), Jiangsu Univ, Sch Automot & Traff Engn, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

The methodology is first able to simulate the state transition process and the duration of each operating state based on Monte Carlo approach, and then the hydraulic analysis of unsteady flow after the system transits to others states is applied to analyze the change law of the actual flow rate through the commercial software SPS (Stoner Pipeline Simulator).

Various quantum information protocols with diverse functionalities have been proposed and implemented. However, in general, the present quantum information system can only carry out a single information protocol or deal with a single communication task, which limits its practical application in the future. Therefore, it is essential to develop a multifunctional platform compatible with multiple different quantum information protocols. In this Letter, by utilizing an all-optical platform consisting of a gain-tunable parametric amplifier, a beam splitter, and an entanglement source, we experimentally realize the partially disembodied quantum state transfer protocol, which links the all-optical quantum teleportation protocol and the optimal 1 -> N coherent state cloning protocol. As a result, these three protocols, which have different physical essences and functionalities, are implemented in a single all-optical machine. In particular, we demonstrate that the partially disembodied quantum state transfer protocol can enhance the state transfer fidelity compared with all-optical quantum teleportation under the same strength of entanglement.

A methodology to assess the gas supply capacity and gas supply reliability of a natural gas pipeline network system is developed in this paper. Due to random failure and maintenance action of the components in the pipeline network system, the system can be in a number of operating states. The methodology is able to simulate the state transition process and the duration of each operating state based on a Monte Carlo approach. After the system transits to other states, the actual flow rate will change accordingly. The hydraulic analysis, which includes thermal-hydraulic simulation and maximum flow algorithm, is applied to analyze the change law of the actual flow rate. By combining the hydraulic analysis into the simulation of the state transition process, gas supply capacity of the pipeline network system is quantified. Furthermore, considering the uncertainty of market demand, the load duration curve (LDC) method is employed to predict the amount of demand for each consumer node. The gas supply reliability is then calculated by comparing the gas supply capacity with market demand. Finally, a detailed procedure for gas supply capacity and gas supply reliability assessment of a natural gas pipeline network system is presented, and its feasibility is confirmed with a case study. In the case study, the impact of market demand uncertainty on gas supply reliability is investigated in detail.","Natural gas pipeline network system; gas supply capacity; gas supply reliability; Monte Carlo approach; Market demand","12th International Pipeline Conference (IPC 2018), Calgary, CANADA, SEP 24-28, 2018","Yu, WC (Corresponding Author), China Univ Petr, Natl Engn Lab Pipeline Safety, Beijing, Peoples R China.

When a software vulnerability becomes known, affected systems are at risk until appropriate updates become available and eventually deployed. This period can last from a few days to several months, during which attackers can develop exploits and take advantage of the vulnerability. It is tedious and time-consuming to keep track of vulnerabilities manually and perform necessary actions to shut down, update, or modify systems. Vulnerabilities affect system components, such as a web server, but sometimes only target specific versions or component combinations.In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automated mode switching of software systems to support system administrators in dealing with vulnerabilities and reducing the risk of exposure. We rely on model-driven techniques and use a multi-modal architecture to react to discovered vulnerabilities and provide automated contingency support. We have developed a dedicated domain-specific language to describe potential mitigation as mode switches. We have evaluated our approach with a web server case study, analyzing historical vulnerability data. Based on the vulnerabilities scores sum, we demonstrated that switching to less vulnerable modes reduced the attack surface in 98.9% of the analyzed time.Editor's note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Our key contribution is that, based on this taxonomy of tradeoffs, we are able to discern the types of consensus algorithms that work well within the application area(s) for a given distributed system.

Compared to internetworking schemes between UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems) and WLAN [3-4], the scheme from [1] has relatively low overhead and latencies because WLAN and MANET are physically and logically similar to each other. However, the mode switching algorithm proposed in [1] for internetworking only considers signal strength and determines handoff, and mobile nodes following a zigzag course in pollution area may frequently perform handoff at short intervals. Furthermore, [1] employs mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) at base, which brings still high delay on handoff and overhead due to signal message exchange. In this paper, we present optimized internetworking scheme between WLAN and MANET, modified from [1]. To settle ping-pong handoff, we propose adaptive mode switching algorithm. HMIPv6 is employed for IP connectivity and mobility service in WLAN, which solves some shortcomings, such as high handoff overhead and vulnerable security from MIPv6.

Most of the existing FSM obfuscation strategies rely on additionally introduced set of obfuscation mode state-transitions to protect the original state-transitions of the FSM. Although these methods assume that it is difficult to extract the FSM behavior from the flattened gate-level netlist, some recent reverse engineering attacks could successfully break the defense of these schemes. The capability of differentiating obfuscation mode state-transitions from normal mode state-transitions makes these attacks powerful. As a countermeasure against these attacks, we propose a new strategy that offers a key-based obfuscation to each state-transition of the FSM. We use a special class of non-group additive cellular automata (CA), called D1 * CA, and it's counterpart D1*CA(dual) to obfuscate each state-transition of the FSM. Each state-transition has its own customized key, which must be configured correctly in order to get correct state-transition behavior from the synthesized FSM. A second layer of protection to the state-transition logic enhances the security of the proposed scheme. An in-depth security analysis of the proposed easily testable key-controlled FSM synthesis scheme demonstrates its ability to thwart the majority of the state-of-the-art attacks, such as FSM reverse engineering, SAT, and circuit unrolling attacks. Thus, the proposed scheme can be used for IP protection of the digital designs. Experimentations on various IWLS'93 benchmark FSM designs show that the average area, power, and delay overheads our proposed multi-bit key-based obfuscated FSM design are 56.43%, 6.87%, and 23.41% while considering the FSMs as standalone circuits. However, experimentation on the Amber23 processor core shows these overheads drastically reduce (reported area, power, and delay overheads values are 0.0025%, 0.44%, and 0%, respectively) while compared with respect to the entire design.","IP Piracy and counterfeiting; Reverse engineering; Finite-State-Machine obfuscation; Cellular automata; Logic encryption","29th IEEE International Symposium on Power and Timing Modeling, Optimization and Simulation (PATMOS), GREECE, JUL 01-03, 2019","Karmakar, R (Corresponding Author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Elect & Elect Commun Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.

Therefore, the use of reasonable spare inventory strategy, as well as maintenance and support decisions to systems is essential to improve system availability, security and system cost reducing. Maintenance strategy can be formulated based on the situation in which the products are monitored. For a single-component system, current research around its multi-state transferring have been quite mature, in which the conversion rate defined in a different state in Markov process can be clearly showed by conversion relationship between different state. However, the state transition process involved mostly considers the processes of repairing only, and rarely considers the impact to system availability by the transition of failure rate caused by changes in components, spare replacement strategies and spare supply. To solve this problem, this paper considered a single-component system with two derating states, and discussed its steady-state availability through variable spare replacement probability and different spare fill rate levels. With model of the system with two derating states established, generalized Markov method was used to solve the relationships between replacement timing and system availability with the level of spare fill rate considered. Finally, through the analysis of results, the preliminary conclusions were obtained. The results could clearly reveal the impacts of spare replacement strategy and spare fill rate in single-component system.","component; single-component; multi-states; replacment stategy; degradation system; system availability","Prognostics and System Health Management Conference (PHM- Hunan), Lab Sci & Technol Integrated Logist Support, Zhangjiajie, PEOPLES R CHINA, AUG 24-27, 2014","Li, T (Corresponding Author), Coll Reliabil & Syst Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.

It allows platforms to get a trustworthy proof of the loaded software and current configuration of certain remote platforms, thereby enabling them to make decisions about the remote platforms' trust status. Common concepts like Internet Protocol security or Transport Layer Security make these decisions based on shared secrets or certificates issued by third parties. Unlike remote attestation, these concepts do not take the current configuration or currently loaded software of the platforms into account. Consequently, combining remote attestation and existing secure channel concepts can solve the long lasting problem of secure channels that have to rely on insecure channel endpoints. Although this gap can now be closed by Trusted Computing, one important problem remains unsolved: A platform's configuration changes every time new software is loaded. Consequently, a reliable and in-time method to provide a proof for this configuration change especially on multiprocess machines - is required to signal the platforms involved in the communication that a configuration change of the respectively other platform has taken place.

To fully utilize the spatial degrees-of-freedom of multiple antennas, the function of antennas at the destination is not predefined, i.e., each antenna can operate in a transmit or receive mode. We propose a low-complexity near-optimal joint optimization scheme by jointly applying the dynamic antenna mode switching (AMS) and optimal power allocation (OPA) techniques, to maximize the secrecy rate of the FD destination-based jamming (DBJ) system. The proposed joint optimization scheme is valid for two different eavesdropping channel state information (ECSI) availability cases, i.e., instantaneous ECSIs and statistical ECSIs. Specifically, closed-form expressions of OPA factors are first derived, and then the optimal transmit and receive antennas sets at the destination are determined by combining the OPA factor and applying a greedy-search-based AMS approach for both ECSIs availabilities, respectively. Moreover, through complexity analysis, the search complexity of the proposed scheme is proven to be significantly reduced compared with the exhaustive searching method.

We then formalize the ``rational'' assumptions that have been used in most blockchains.

Furthermore, they provide effective models of complex natural systems to explore resilience concepts over experimentally-tractable short timescales. We studied soils derived from experimental plots with different land-use histories of long-term grass, arable and fallow to determine whether regimes of extreme drying and re-wetting would tip the systems into alternative stable states, contingent on their historical management. Prior to disturbance, grass and arable soils produced similar respiration responses when processing an introduced complex carbon substrate. A distinct respiration response from fallow soil here indicated a different prior functional state. Initial dry: wet disturbances reduced the respiration in all soils, suggesting that the microbial community was perturbed such that its function was impaired. After 12 drying and rewetting cycles, despite the extreme disturbance regime, soil from the grass plots, and those that had recently been grass, adapted and returned to their prior functional state. Arable soils were less resilient and shifted towards a functional state more similar to that of the fallow soil. Hence repeated stresses can apparently induce persistent shifts in functional states in soils, which are influenced by management history.","","","Todman, LC (Corresponding Author), Rothamsted Res, Harpenden AL5 2JQ, Herts, England.

By using the Bellman equation, the utility for the state transitions of a sensor can be written in standard forms of dynamic programming. It reveals a natural way to find the optimal detection rate that is by maximizing the total utility of the compromised state of the node (the sum of current utility and future utility).

Dynamic power management is adopted to control the working state transition of Edge Data Center (EDC) servers. A load prediction model based on long-short term memory (LSTM) is creatively proposed. The innovation of the model is to shut down the server in idle state or low utilization in EDC, consider user mobility and EDC location information, learn the global optimal dynamic timeout threshold strategy and N-policy through trial and error reinforcement learning method, reasonably control the working state switching of the server, and realize load prediction and analysis. The results show that the performance of AdaGrad optimization solver is the best when the feature dimension is 3, the number of LSTM network layers is 6, the time series length is 30-45, the batch size is 128, the training time is 788 s, the number of units is 250, and the number of times is 350.

Compared with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) load prediction, the dynamic power management method of LSTM load prediction can reduce energy consumption by 12.5% and realize the balance between EDC system performance and energy consumption. The system can effectively meet the requirements of multi-access edge computing (MEC) for low delay, high bandwidth and high reliability, reduce unnecessary energy consumption and waste, and reduce the cost of MEC service providers in actual operation.

To address the issue, we first predict the optimal IoT malware dissemination strategy based on a signaling game for edge computing-assisted IoT systems. We then develop an algorithm to obtain the solution of the signaling IoT availability assessment game, which is to factually reflect IoT malware dissemination in practice and reasonably express the probability of IoT system nodes being successfully infected by malware. Thus, a state transition diagram of IoT system nodes can be further designed, illustrating intercommunication among all six states during IoT malware dissemination. Upon this state transition diagram, we represent the state transition probability of IoT system nodes in each state utilizing a Markov matrix, and attain the steady-state availability of an IoT system node from reliability theory. Consequently, we deduce metrics to access the steady-state availability of the entire IoT system under typical star-, tree-, and mesh topologies, respectively. We also design the corresponding IoT system availability assessment algorithm from the view of practice. In this manner, an availability assessment mechanism for edge computing-based IoT systems with malware dissemination is constructed.

However, there are comparatively less works that focus on detecting cyber attacks against the physical process itself. Detection mechanisms that do so are said to be process aware. In this paper, we propose a time-based process aware intrusion detection system (IDS) that detects attacks against a physical process by leveraging its regular nature and temporal properties. The IDS learns the temporal behavior of the process variables and uses it to detect attacks. We evaluate the performance of our IDS on a public SCADA dataset and on a simulated SCADA system developed as part of this study, and we compare it with two other process-aware IDS proposed in the literature.

However, testing TCP stacks is difficult. First, a TCP stack accepts packets and system calls that have dependencies between each other, and thus generating effective test cases is challenging. Second, a TCP stack has various complex state transitions, but existing testing approaches target covering states instead of covering state transitions, and thus their testing coverage is limited. Finally, our study of TCP stack commits shows that 87% of bug-fixing commits are related to semantic bugs (such as RFC violations), but existing bug sanitizers can detect only memory bugs not semantic bugs. In this paper, we design a novel fuzzing framework named TCP-Fuzz, to effectively test TCP stacks and detect bugs. TCP-Fuzz consists of three key techniques: (1) a dependency-based strategy that considers dependencies between packets and system calls, to generate effective test cases; (2) a transition-guided fuzzing approach that uses a new coverage metric named branch transition as program feedback, to improve the coverage of state transitions; (3) a differential checker that compares the outputs of multiple TCP stacks for the same inputs, to detect semantic bugs. We have evaluated TCP-Fuzz on five widely-used TCP stacks (TLDK, F-Stack, mTCP, FreeBSD TCP and Linux TCP), and find 56 real bugs (including 8 memory bugs and 48 semantic bugs). 40 of these bugs have been confirmed by related developers.","","USENIX Annual Technical Conference / 15th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI), ELECTR NETWORK, JUL 14-16, 2021","Zou, YH (Corresponding Author), Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Although regular expressions offer superior expressive ability and flexibility, application protocols are described by regular expression manually based on sufficiently understanding protocol itself. At present there is not an effect method to realize classification, recognition and control automatically for the known applications and the unknown applications in future. In this paper a novel approach is presented to model network application specification. In this work, the whole automatic protocol reverse engineering is realized through accomplishing the protocol state machine, and then the FSMs are translated to corresponding regular expressions to enrich and update the pattern database. This approach uses grammatical inference and is motivated by the observation that an implementation of the protocol is inherently a state transition process, the state machine model the essence exactly. The important significance is to describe various state protocols with a common method through modeling the protocol state transition, including known and unknown ones. This approach had been implemented in the system and evaluated using real-world implementations of three different protocols: HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and compared the extracted protocol to the corresponding other newly system, such as 17-filter.","protocol reverse engineering; automaton inference; regular expression; Protocol analysis","3rd International Conference on Network and System Security, Surfers Paradise, AUSTRALIA, OCT 19-21, 2009","Xiao, MM (Corresponding Author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

However, Ajax techniques that enable better web experiences also make it fairly challenging to model Ajax application behaviors in the complex browser environment. In Ajax applications, server-side states are no longer synchronous with the views to end users at the client side. Therefore, to model the behaviors of Ajax applications, it is indispensable to incorporate client-side application states into the behavior models, as being explored by prior work. Unfortunately, how to leverage behavior models to perform security diagnosis in Ajax applications has yet been thoroughly examined. Existing models extracted from Ajax application behaviors are insufficient in a security context. In this paper, we propose a new behavior model for diagnosing attacks in Ajax applications, which abstracts both client-side state transitions as well as their communications to external servers. Our model articulates different states with the browser events or user actions that trigger state transitions. With a prototype implementation, we demonstrate that the proposed model is effective in attack diagnosis for real-world Ajax applications.","","18th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS), Singapore, SINGAPORE, JUL 17-19, 2013","Dong, XS (Corresponding Author), Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Comp, Singapore 117548, Singapore.

This paper presents a novel methodology for real-time assessment of short-term voltage stability (STVS) under large disturbances with an approach based on data mining and machine learning. This methodology classifies off-line the power system stability in multiple operating states through the calculation of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and dynamic voltage indices. This allows identifying not only fast voltage collapses (FVC) but also fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) events. The multivariate time series data of the power system dynamic response are processed and transformed with a symbolic representation technique. This together with the operating state classification are used to train an intelligent machine based on Random Forest proposed for applying in real time to classify the post-disturbance operating state. This methodology is tested in the New England 39-bus system. The performance of the methodology to classify the STVS in real time was verified, obtaining a classification error less than 2% using a post-contingency data window of 0.58 s and less than one-third of all the bus voltage measurements. Results show the ability of the methodology to predict voltage stability problems, having enough time to carry out automatic control actions to prevent or mitigate problems.","Short-term voltage stability; Power systems; Machine learning; Wide-area monitoring system; Time series classification","","Pinzon, JD (Corresponding Author), Natl Univ San Juan, CONICET, Inst Elect Energy, San Juan, Argentina.

Given a set of access control policies, a general safety requirement in such a system is to determine whether a desirable property is satisfied in all the reachable states. Such an analysis calls for formal verification. While formal analysis on traditional RBAC has been done to some extent, the extensions of RBAC lack such an analysis. In this paper, we propose a formal technique to perform security analysis on the Generalized Temporal RBAC (GTRBAC) model which can be used to express a wide range of temporal constraints on different RBAC components like role, user and permission. In the proposed approach, at first the GTRBAC system is mapped to a state transition system built using timed automata. Characteristics of each role, user and permission are captured with the help of timed automata. A single global clock is used to express the various temporal constraints supported in a GTRBAC model. Next, a set of safety and liveness properties is specified using computation tree logic (CTL). Model checking based formal verification is then done to verify the properties against the model to determine if the system is secure with respect to a given set of access control policies. Both time and space analysis has been done for studying the performance of the approach under different configurations.","GTRBAC; Timed Automata; Security Analysis; Model Checking; CTL","14th ACM Symposium on Access Control Models and Technologies, Stresa, ITALY, JUN 03-05, 2009","Mondal, S (Corresponding Author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Sch IT, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India.

In this paper, without considering transmission capacity constraints for simplicity, aggregated wind generation is modeled as a discrete Markov process with state transition matrices established based on historical data. Wind generation is then integrated into system demand with multiple net demand levels at each hour. To accommodate the uncertain net demand, a stochastic unit commitment problem is formulated based on states instead of scenarios. The objective is to minimize the total commitment cost of conventional generators and their total expected dispatch cost while satisfying all possible net demand levels. The advantage of this formulation is that the state at a time instant summarizes the information of all previous instants in a probabilistic sense for reduced complexity. With state transition probabilities given, state probabilities calculated before optimization, and the objective function and constraints formulated in a linear manner, the problem is effectively solved by using branch-and-cut.

The use of trusted platform modules (TPMs) offers new methods for improving the security of these well established technologies. How secure channel technologies can be adapted to use trusted computing concepts is subject to current research. A major part of this research addresses the integration of the TCGs specified remote attestation. Remote attestation enables a platform to provide a trustworthy proof of its current configuration (i.e. software that has been loaded on the platform). Hence, based on this proof a remote platform can decide whether to open a channel to another platform or not. In current approaches, the proof of the platform configuration is processed before a secure channel is established, which is not opened if the reported configuration is not accepted by the hosts. However, one important problem has not been solved yet. Currently, no satisfying solution how the change of a platform's configuration can be securely and reliably reported to the remote platform whilst a channel is open, exists. A reliable method to provide a proof for a configuration change can be implemented with only minor modifications of the TPM specification and the TLS protocol.

FSMs should be accurately extracted for watermark insertion, fault injection assessment of control paths in a system-on-chip (SoC), information leakage assessment, control-flow reverse engineering in RTL abstraction, logic obfuscation, etc. However, it is quite unfortunate that, as of today, existing state-of-the-art synthesis tools cannot provide accurate and reliable extraction of all FSMs from the provided high-level RTL code. Precise identification of all FSM state registers and the pure combinational state transition logic described in the RTL code with numerous registers and other combinational logic makes it quite challenging to develop such a solution. In this paper, we propose a framework named RTL-FSMx to extract FSMs from high-level RTL codes written in Verilog HDL. RTL-FSMx utilizes node-based analysis on the abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the RTL code to isolate FSM state registers from other registers. RTLFSMx automatically extracts state transition graphs (STGs) for each of the detected FSM state registers and additional information of the extracted FSMs. Experimental results on a large number of benchmark circuits demonstrate that RTLFSMx accurately recovers all control FSMs from RTL codes with various complexity and size within just a few seconds.","Register Transfer Level; FSM Extraction; HDL; Code Analysis; Security Assessment; FSM Automata Theory","IEEE International Test Conference (ITC), Anaheim, CA, SEP 25-30, 2022","Kibria, R (Corresponding Author), Univ Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.

Identification of an accurate lower-order model for the `external system' makes it possible to carry out the stability analysis of a study system faster than the analysis for the original detailed system. However, the identified lower-order model becomes invalid when the operating state changes in the power system. `Black box' representation of the `external system' with the application of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is widely discussed in the literature. In such equivalent models, the DNN response changes based on two aspects i.e. the operating point of the power system and the location/type of the fault. In this paper, a clustering algorithm is proposed to identify the clusters of the `external system' models for different states of the power system, and a DNN is trained for each cluster. The clustering algorithm is based on the pre-fault steady-state power flow from the `external system' to the `study system', which is a reflection of changes in the system state. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between responses of the actual fault and the predicted fault is used to evaluate the accuracy of the identified system. The proposed technique is easy to implement and requires a lesser number of DNN models compared to identifying an individual DNN model for each operating point to represent the `external system'.","power system; dynamic equivalent systems; black-box identification; deep neural networks; K means clustering","14th IEEE PES Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC), Melbourne, AUSTRALIA, NOV 20-23, 2022","Aththanayake, L (Corresponding Author), Deakin Univ, Sch Engn, Ctr Smart Power & Energy Res, SEBE, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.

The focus of this paper is the design of a DOK security service that provides for enforcing both local security policies, related to the security of local autonomous databases, and federated security policies, governing access to data aggregates composed of data from multiple distributed databases. We propose Global Access Control, an extended access control mechanism enabling a uniform expression of heterogeneous security information. Mappings from existing Mandatory and Discretionary Access Controls are described. To permit the control of data aggregation, the derivation of unauthorized information from authorized data, our security framework provides a logic-based language, the Federated Logic Language (FELL), which can describe constraints on both single and multiple states of the federation. To enforce constraints, FELL statements are mapped to state transition graphs which model the different subcomputations required to check the aggregation constraints, Graph aggregation operations are proposed for building compound state transition graphs for complex constraints. To monitor aggregation constraints, two marking techniques, called Linear Marking Technique and Zigzag Marking Technique, are proposed. Finally, we describe a three-layer DOK logical secure architecture enabling the implementation of the different security agents. This includes a Coordination layer, a Task layer, and a Database layer. Each contains specialized agents that enforce a different part of the federated security policy, Coordination is performed by the DOK Manager, enforcing security is performed by a specialized Constraint Manager agent, and the database functions are implemented by user and data agents.","Access Control; data aggregation; inference; distributed databases; federated databases; CORBA","","Tari, Z (Corresponding Author), RMIT Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Informat Technol, GPO Box 2476V, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.

However, it will give attackers the possibility of discovering vulnerabilities in the system, and the control systems lack the ability of dynamic perception of security state and risk, causing the systems to be exposed to risks. In this article, a dynamic Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model is proposed. The conditional random field (CRF) is introduced into the BLP model to optimize the rules. First, the model formalizes the security attributes, states of system, transition rules, and constraint models on the basis of the state transition of CRFs. After the historical system access logs are processed as the original dataset, a feature selection method is proposed to extract the requests and current states as feature vectors. Second, this article presents a rules training algorithm based on L-BFGS to implement the study and training of datasets, and then marks the logs in the test set through Viterbi algorithm automatically. On the base of these, a rule generation algorithm is proposed to dynamically adjust the access control rules based on the current security status and events of the system. Third, the security of CRFs-BLP is proved by theoretical analysis. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the model are verified by estimating the value of the precision, recall, and F1-score. As the system threats are shown to be decreased obviously from these experiments, this dynamic model can decrease the vulnerabilities and risk effectively.","Bell-LaPadula (BLP); conditional random fields (CRFs); feature extraction; machine learning; mandatory access control (MAC); model training; rule optimization","","Xiong, NN (Corresponding Author), Tianjin Univ, Coll Intelligence & Comp, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China.

Therefore, a time-efficient and accurate approach to assessing sensor trustworthiness is necessary. To this end, we propose T-LHDM (a trust model based on low and high decision-making processes), a sensor state trust model based on a Markov chain to represent sensor state transitions in normal operating conditions. To demonstrate the model, we first observed sensed data in a hierarchical decision-making process by intentionally exploiting the sensor data's temporal and spatial correlations. Then, the consistency between the precomputed set of sensor state transitions and the observed ones was used to detect corruptions and assess the sensor trustworthiness. Our experiments using two real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed model accurately assessed the sensor trustworthiness with an average accuracy of 95%. We also stress the significance of considering the sensor's spatiotemporal correlations to assess the trust of the sensed data, which has been neglected in previous studies. To this end, we conducted a comparative evaluation against a contemporary temporal correlation-based method and three well-known correlation tests.

However, prevailing operating rules were constant, which is incapable to be dynamically updated based on new observations. To address this issue, adaptive complementary operating rules were developed to deal with the future uncertainties of reservoir inflow and solar radiation using ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). First, a long-term complementary optimization model was developed to derive the initial parameters of linear operating rules. Then, the optimal decisions under historical condition were used as the observation. Finally, six assimilation schemes were proposed, according to the two state transition equations (the same period of the previous year, the previous period) and three observations (the same period of the previous year, the previous period and their joint). China's Longyangxia hydro-PV hybrid power plant was chosen as a case study. Results show that (1) the two state transition equations have comparative effects on operation results, (2) the choice of observation plays a decisive role. The assimilation scheme, in which the optimal operation decision of the same period in previous year is as observation, outperforms the stationary operating rules. Specifically, the total power generation and guaranteed rate are improved by 7.14% and 5.33%, respectively, (3) the deriving framework works effectively under the synthetic nonstationary reservoir inflow and solar radiation, and ensures the stability and security of energy system in the changing environment.","Hydro-PV hybrid power plant; Adaptive complementary operating rules; EnKF; Changing environment","","Liu, P (Corresponding Author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.

Probability theory and mathematical statistics are used to process and normalize the data in order to determine whether or not the system is in the correct operating mode and control process state. To describe the mode-specific control processes of a CPS, the paradigm of using cyber-physical parameters is taken as a basis, as it is the feature that most clearly reflects the system's interaction with physical processes. In this study, two metrics were taken as a sign of an anomaly: the probability of falling into the sensor values' confidence interval and parameter change monitoring. These two metrics, as well as the current mode evaluation, produce a final probability function for our trust in the CPS's currently executing control process, which is, in turn, determined by the operating mode of the system. Based on the results of this trust assessment, it is possible to draw a conclusion about the processing state in which the system is operating. If the score is higher than 0.6, it means the system is in a trusted state. If the score is equal to 0.6, it means the system is in an uncertain state. If the trust score tends towards zero, then the system can be interpreted as unstable or under stress due to a system failure or deliberate attack. Through a case study using cyber-attack data for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), it was found that the method works well. When we were evaluating the normal flight mode, there were no false positive anomaly estimates. When we were evaluating the UAV's state during an attack, a deviation and an untrusted state were detected. This method can be used to implement software solutions aimed at detecting system faults and cyber-attacks, and thus make decisions about the presence of malfunctions in the operation of a CPS, thereby minimizing the amount of knowledge and initial data about the system.","cyber-physical system; unmanned vehicle; cyber-attacks; anomalies; verification","","Basan, E (Corresponding Author), Southern Fed Univ, Inst Comp Technol & Informat Secur, Chekhova 2, Taganrog 347922, Russia.

This study first considers the unknown coefficients in the discrete wavelet transform and the unknown weights of these coefficients, as well as the state-switching embedded equations in an optimization model to embed digital information or private message. Next, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theorem and minimum-energy approach play two essential roles to determine the unknown coefficients and the unknown weights so as to complete the information embedding or private message communication. In addition, the extraction of private message is similar to the private message embedding reversely.

Construction of an accurate and reliable prediction model for the volatility changes in energy consumption can provide valuable reference information for policy makers of the government and for the energy industry. In view of this, a novel improved model is developed in this article by integrating the modified state transition algorithm (MSTA) with the Gaussian processes regression (GPR) approach for non-fossil energy consumption predictions for China at the end of the 13th Five-Year Project, in which the MSTA is utilized for effective optimization of hyper-parameters in GPR. Aiming for validating the superiority of MSTA, several comparisons are conducted on two well-known functions and the optimization results show the effectiveness of modification in the state transition algorithm (STA). Then, based on the latest statistical renewable energy consumption data, the MSTA-GPR model is utilized to generate consumption predictions for overall renewable energy and each single renewable energy source, including hydropower, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and other energies, respectively. The forecasting results reveal that the proposed improved GPR can promote the forecasting ability of basic GPR and obtain the best prediction effect among all the other comparison models.

Recent studies have revealed that control programs running on CPS devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g., code-injection or code-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks). Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime data-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics checking. In this work, we propose Orpheus, a new security methodology for defending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution semantics. We first present a general method for reasoning cyber-physical execution semantics of a control program (i.e., causal dependencies between the physical context/event and program control flows), including the event identification and dependence analysis. As an instantiation of Orpheus, we then present a new program behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton (eFSA). eFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of CPS control programs and incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented exploits if a specific physical event is missing along with the corresponding event dependent state transition. We evaluate our prototype's performance by conducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that eFSA can successfully detect different runtime attacks. Our prototype on Raspberry Pi incurs a low overhead, taking 0.0001s for each state transition integrity checking, and 0.063s similar to 0.211s for the cyber-physical contextual consistency checking.","Cyber-physical systems; data-oriented attacks; program anomaly detection; cyber-physical execution semantics","","Cheng, L (Corresponding Author), Clemson Univ, Sch Comp, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.

To maintain the availability of the control system, the availability of anomaly detection itself is important. This paper considers a third-party monitoring system with multiple anomaly detection functions. The third monitoring system devotes control systems to control operations instated of security operations. Also, when a control system is subjected to a high-level cyberattack which loses control and security functions, it is expected that the multiple detection functions allow the operator to detect the abnormality earlier. Our proposed system uses two redundant PLCs for sequence control, and one of them is for normal operation, and the other one is for anomaly detection. They operate in conjunction, and when the cyberattacked PLC deviates from the normal operation, the anomaly detection PLC turns on the LED to make it easier to recognize visually, and determines that it is an anomaly. The cyberattack detection method is that the anomaly detection PLC always holds the normal state transition information of the control PLC, and the former PLC always monitors that of the latter PLC. Only when an abnormality occurs, the former PLC detects it as an abnormality. The display method of the detection way is shown by using three types of LEDs. By LEDs turning on or off, the operator can recognize which status is abnormal. The LED lighting state is shown in the state transition diagram, and we explain the superiority of the third-party monitoring system incorporating multiple detection methods.","","IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII), Honolulu, HI, JAN 12-15, 2020","Sakata, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Electrocommun, Dept Mech Engn & Intelligence, Chofu, Tokyo 2060033, Japan.

Despite of the convenience in collecting information to provide the decision basis for the users, the vulnerability of embedded sensor nodes in multimedia devices makes the malware propagation a growing serious problem, which would harm the security of devices and their users financially and physically in wireless multimedia system (WMS). Therefore, many researches related to the malware propagation and suppression have been proposed to protect the topology and system security of wireless multimedia network. In these studies, the epidemic model is of great significance to the analysis of malware propagation. Considering the cloud and state transition of sensor nodes, a cloud-assisted model for malware detection and the dynamic differential game against malware propagation are proposed in this paper. Firstly, a SVM based malware detection model is constructed with the data sharing at the security platform in the cloud. Then the number of malware-infected nodes with physical infectivity to susceptible nodes is calculated precisely based on the attributes of WMS transmission. Then the state transition among WMS devices is defined by the modified epidemic model. Furthermore, a dynamic differential game and target cost function are successively derived for the Nash equilibrium between malware and WMS system. On this basis, a saddle-point malware detection and suppression algorithm is presented depending on the modified epidemic model and the computation of optimal strategies. Numerical results and comparisons show that the proposed algorithm can increase the utility of WMS efficiently and effectively.","Internet of Things; wireless multimedia system; state transition; malware propagation; differential game","","Zhou, WW (Corresponding Author), Zhengzhou Inst Informat Sci & Technol, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China.

It takes place when the basic function of the electric utilities, to supply customers, fails due to faults in the network. Restoration of supply to the affected customers can be a large-scale combinatorial problem with the control operators under pressure to find a restoration solution and implement it as quickly as possible. Therefore, they need an effective computer-based restoration solution to aid them. The paper describes a modular restoration strategy designed to deal with realistic, large-scale outages caused by faults of any type in HV and MV distribution networks. It is based on heuristic search guided by expert knowledge. In searching for a restoration solution the strategy utilises the available spare loading capacity of both the HV and the MV networks as necessary. The algorithm observes the loading constraint in discrete time resulting in more affected load demand supplied in the case of partial restoration and a smaller number of switching operations in the general case. By giving preference to remotely operated switching devices over manually operated switching devices it brings about fast implementation of a restoration scenario. In the case of partial restoration it restores important customers with priority. To do that more efficiently, it considers a hierarchy of the important customers. The proposed restoration strategy can be an effective aid to control operators, however it is also an effective tool in training and in establishing network reconfigurations for maintenance work and in assisting system security analyses.","distribution systems; restoration","","Curcic, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Abertay Dundee, Sch Engn, Bell St, Dundee DD1 1HG, Scotland.

The state of the art for the formal verification of secure software requires representation of an abstract model, and one or more refinements (to the model), in a formal specification language. These specifications are then examined for self-consistency with their properties, as well as for consistency between levels of abstraction, all of which can be time consuming, and costly. Alloy provides a simple, intuitive logic framework, in contrast to many other formal languages that are intended to support general-purpose mathematics. In order to determine whether Alloy can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the verification of secure computer systems, we used it to specify portions of the LPSK formal security policy model and formal top-level specification, and utilized the Alloy Analyzer to examine the consistency of the specifications. The security-critical system elements and predicates for security properties were defined in terms of a state model, and system operations were represented as state transitions. While Alloy does not support induction or proofs, it can be used to find counter examples in a small scope of state transitions. We conclude that Alloy has few limitations and is suitable, as measured by utility and ease of use, to include in the toolbox for rapid high-assurance system development. The primary concern with using Alloy for industrial, versus academic, security verification is the scalability of the Alloy Analyzer with respect to the state-space of the security model and formal top-level specification. For real system verification, Alloy must support a much larger scope. We found that the translation of an existing informal LPSK security policy model to Alloy provided insight for making the model clearer. It is also apparent that Alloy allows for the beginner to formal system verification to quickly climb its learning curve.","software verification; principles, least privilege; information flow controls, separation kernels; formal languages","3rd International Conference on Information Warfare and Security, Univ Nebraska, Peter Kiewit Inst, Omaha, NE, APR 24-25, 2008","Phelps, David; Auguston, Mikhail; Levin, Timothy, USN, Postgrad Sch, Monterey, CA USA.","English",""

Two new technologies make this scaling possible without any virtualization software: (1) self-transition management and (2) unified virtual address mapping. Evaluations show that this domain control provides highly scalable performance and incurs almost no performance overhead in security-domains. The increase in OSs in binary code size is less than 1.5%, and the time required for individual state transitions is on the order of a single millisecond.

In this paper, SAS is viewed as a network consisting of functional related automation devices (AD), which can be described by The Structural Functions and The Correlation Matrices. We assess the dynamic element state probabilities of each aging multi-state AD using a stochastic process model, which is identified as a Markov model. The state distribution of the entire SAS is evaluated via the combination of the stochastic process and universal generating function. Finally, it takes four typical SAS as an example to describe the validity and superiority of the multi-state model in the reliability evaluation.

A fundamental aspect of a security model is a proof that validates that every state reachable from a secure initial state is secure. A sequential security model assumes that every command that acts as a state transition executes sequentially, while a concurrent security model assumes that multiple commands execute concurrently. This paper presents a security model called the Centralized-Parallel-Distributed model (CPD model) that defines security for logically, or physically centralized, parallel, and distributed systems. The purpose of the CPD model is to define concurrency conditions that guarantee that a concurrent system cannot reach a state in which privileges are configured in a nonsecure manner.

In this paper, we introduce the security analysis problem for this class of policies, where we seek to answer security queries about future states of the system graph and authorizations that are decided accordingly.

The formulation is useful for the evaluation of reactive power value, for effective investment of slow and fast VAR devices, for the examination of pricing and procurement of VARs through market. Since load shedding is the last resort for keeping security, the annual expectation of the load shedding cost is used as a security index to evaluate the overall benefits of VAR resources which respond in dynamic state transitions in contingencies. The proposed formulation takes into account the multiple benefits of reactive power in a single problem, which may be useful to evaluate the real value of the VARs. It is demonstrated that the maximum cost saving is achieved by a balanced installation of SC and SVC with keeping a specified security level.

We give a precise definition of security analysis problems in MDR(2)BAC, which is more general than safety analysis that is studied in single-domain. We show the process of dynamic permission adjustment in multi-domain environment, and illustrate two classes of problems in the process which can be reduced to similar analysis in the RT[<-,boolean AND] role-based trust-management language, thereby establishing an interesting relationship between MDR(2)BAC and the RT framework.

In order to capture the dynamic information of traffic, we introduce increment which is calculated as the product of function and derivative to long short-term memory (LSTM). Furthermore, the state change are applied to LSTM which is considered as incremental LSTM. Finally, we analyzed the effect of the state change on the performance of incremental LSTM by experiments.

The SNIP model can be solved to obtain the probability of reaching security failed states along with the meantime to security failure (MTTSF). In the second part of the paper, we use a discrete event dynamic system model of security dynamics. We show how to derive events and transitions from existing security taxonomies. We then apply theory of discrete event control to define safety properties of the computer system in terms of the basic concepts of controllability used in discrete event control for two special sub-languages K-S and K-V. These languages correspond to maximally robust controllable sub-languages. In the third approach, we show that by associating cost with the state transitions, the security quantification problem can be casted as Markov decision problem (MDP).

Rigorous and designer-friendly methodologies for modeling and analyzing secure software are highly desirable.

To narrow this gap, this paper presents a UML-based framework for modeling and analyzing security threats (i.e. potential security attacks) rigorously and visually. We model the intended functions of a software application with UML statechart diagrams and the security threats with sequence diagrams, respectively. Statechart diagrams are automatically converted into a graph transformation system, which has a well-established theoretical foundation. Method invocations in a sequence diagram of a security threat are interpreted as a sequence of paired graph transformations. Therefore, the analysis of a security threat is conducted through simulating the state transitions from an initial state to a final state triggered by method invocations. In our approach, designers directly work with UML diagrams to visually model system behaviors and security threats while threats can still be rigorously analyzed based on graph transformation.","Graph transformation; visual modeling and analysis; security threats","","Kong, J (Corresponding Author), N Dakota State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Fargo, ND USA.

An extensible security model ZMsec (Z-MARTE security model), which extends Z with elements of MARTE (Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded systems) and FSA (Finite State Automata), is presented to describe three dimensions of software: security usecases, static structures and dynamic behaviors. Further on, this paper designs ZMsecTL (ZMsecTemporal Logic) formulas to describe security properties, and proposes ZMCA (ZMsec Model Checking Algorithm), a security model checking algorithm on ZMsec model, to verify security properties in ZMsecTL formulas. In order to provide an intuitive state transition diagram for model checking, a depth-first ZMsecSD (ZMsecState Diagram) generation algorithm is designed.

In general, a smart terminal can be switched between the licensed modes (e.g. LTE) and the unlicensed modes (e.g. WiFi) according to user's demands (e.g. costs). The designed tradeoff is that the demands can be met by switching, but the security of wireless transmissions may be deteriorated, as the wireless communications can be overheard by the eavesdropper. The authors propose a transmission mode aware smart terminal scheduling (TM-STS) scheme to improve the security of wireless transmissions of a smart terminal.

Voting systems are used in a wide variety of applications where an acceptance or rejection decision has to be made about a binary proposition presented to the system. For these systems, it is of interest to obtain the probability so that based on the vote of decision-making units, the system aggregates these votes into the right decision when presented with such a proposition. This paper presents a holistic work on weighted voting system reliability by presenting modeling, computation, estimation and optimization techniques. The modeling part takes advantage of the structure of weighted voting systems to present a model of its reliability as a multi-state system. Next, based on the multi-state view of the system, an exact computational approach based on multi-state minimal cut and path vectors is introduced. The paper then acknowledges the computational complexity of the problem and provides a Monte Carlo simulation approach that estimates system reliability accurately and in an efficient computational time.

Due to the close and proprietary nature of industrial protocols, it is difficult to conduct protocol analysis and protection on these protocols. To address this issue, we propose a novel protocol analysis framework, named ICS-PAS, for ICS protocols. ICS-PAF could differentiate unknown protocols and their command types, extract protocol format and recognize the data types of protocol payloads. In addition, ICS-PAF could also infer and model the state transition of ICS protocols. ICS-PAS requires no prior knowledge and could deal with binary protocols. We also conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the performance of ICS-PAS. The results show that ICS-PAS outperforms traditional approaches in terms of recognition accuracy and efficiency.","Industrial Control Systems; Protocol analysis; Security","2nd International Conference on Smart Computing and Communication (SmartCom), Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINA, DEC 10-12, 2017","Lu, XD (Corresponding Author), State Grid Zhejiang Elect Power Co, Elect Power Res Inst, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.

The salient features of VANET, such as highly dynamic connections, sensitive information sharing, and unreliable fading channels, make the security quantification challenging. Accurate measurement for VANET security depends on the sufficient understanding of ``context'', or making sense of the states, environment, or situation. This article proposes a context-aware security quantification scheme for VANET based on the Markov chain. Firstly, a Homogeneous Continuous-Time Markov Chain (HCTMC)-based security state model is designed for VANET. The value of each state of the HCTMC is determined with a value function that incorporates the security strength of transmitted data, dynamic and randomness of the vehicular channel, and transmission delay of the current situated environment of VANETs. Finally, the state transition matrix is derived based on the Homogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain (HDTMC) and Homogeneous Poisson Process (HPP). Simulation results show that the security quantification method enables the VANET's system to adopt context-aware defense strategies according to the situated environment.","Security quantification; VANET; Markov chain; state transition","","Sun, ZM (Corresponding Author), Jilin Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Changchun 130012, Peoples R China.

The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a widely applied open standard protocol for IoT networks. The RPL routing is highly vulnerable to routing attacks due to the constrained nodes. The attacks on the RPL aim to disrupt the optimal protocol structure and significantly deteriorating network performance. Secure RPL routing schemes attempt to derive a high-level abstract of RPL operations through network simulation traces and apply it as a reference to differentiate the malicious behavior. The RPL specifications include all the states and transitions with its corresponding statistics. However, the malicious activities around a node enforce it to initiate the unnecessary state transition, and thus, the legitimate nodes are equally treated as malicious in dynamic IoT network scenarios. Hence, this work proposes a game theoretic model based anomaly Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect the RPL attacks and verify and confirm their malicious activities. This study formulates the Game models based Anomaly Intrusion Detection System (GAIDS) for RPL security. The proposed approach consists of two interrelated formulations, such as a stochastic game for attack detection and evolutionary game for attack confirmation. The stochastic game model formulates the activities of the standard RPL rules as a zero-sum stochastic game. The stochastic game estimates the payoff by observing the states, transitions between them, and their statistics. However, there is a possibility to model legitimate players as malicious, due to the nature of RPL. Thus, the proposed GAIDS scheme implements the evolutionary game theoretic framework on clustered network topology for the attack verification. By synchronizing the results of the stochastic game of neighboring players, it differentiates the legitimate players from the suspected list successfully. As a result, the GAIDS isolates the detected attackers and maintains the routing performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the detection accuracy and throughput of the proposed gaming model based anomaly IDS is substantially high and outperforms the existing scheme.","IoT; Secure RPL; Game theory; State; Transition; Transition statistics; Anomaly IDS; Routing performance","","Gothawal, DB (Corresponding Author), VIT, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

This limitation gives rise to problems where web functions, such as a cache that stores contents, cannot be defined and attacks that forge contents cannot be analyzed. These problems are present in the Alloy-based implementations of current models that do not have the ability to express temporal logic. Therefore, we design implementation and evaluation of temporal logic in Alloy to express time series and parallel computation for web security analysis. In doing so, state transitions in the web can be expressed by fitting them in our proposed syntax. As concrete applications, we describe a web security model that includes caches and show that our proposed syntax can analyze state-of-the-art attacks, such as unauthorized access to users' account pages via caches.

In this paper, a synergistic combination of Surrogate Augmented Lagrangian Relaxation and branch-and-cut is presented. With system coupling constraints relaxed and quadratic penalties on constraint violations added, the augmented Lagrangian is innovatively linearized and decomposed into subproblems to be solved by branch-and-cut. Subproblem solutions are then effectively coordinated based on Surrogate subgradients with much reduced computation requirements and multiplier zigzagging, and accelerated reduction of constraint violations. Numerical testing of a complicated MISO SCUC case demonstrates that our method generates near-optimal solutions in short solving times and significantly outperforms branch-and-cut.","Branch-and-cut; large-scale mixed integer programming; security constrained unit commitment; surrogate augmented Lagrangian Relaxation","2017 IEEE Power & Energy Society General Meeting, Chicago, IL, JUL 16-20, 2017","Sun, XR (Corresponding Author), Univ Connecticut, Elect & Comp Engn, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.

While this may be beneficial from the performance and energy perspective, it certainly exhibits new challenges in terms of security due to increased data transmission over networks with potentially unknown threats. Among possible security issues are timing attacks which are not prevented by traditional cryptographic security. Metrics on which offloading decisions are based must include security aspects in addition to performance and energy-efficiency. This paper aims at quantifying the security attributes and their impact on the performance of mobile offloading systems. The offloading system is modeled as a hybrid CTMC and queueing model. The proposed model focuses on state transition and state-based control. The quantification analysis is carried out for steady-state behavior of the CTMC model as to optimize the weighted-sum cost measure. By transforming the security model to a model with absorbing state, we compute the ``mean time to security failure'' (MTTSF) measure. Finally, a security and performance tradeoff measure is computed based on the system model and optimum parameter set is found for the system.","Mobile offloading; Security attributes; Quantitative analysis; Phase-type distribution","12th European Performance Engineering Workshop (EPEW), Madrid, SPAIN, AUG 31-SEP 01, 2015","Meng, TH (Corresponding Author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Takustr 9, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.

Two refinement relations used in these patterns are formally defined. For each pattern, proof obligations are proposed to ensure preservation of behaviour through refinement. The proposed refinement relations essentially consist in preserving scenarios by replacing abstract events with concrete events, or by introducing new events. Deadlocks cannot be introduced; divergence over new events is allowed in one of the refinement relation. We prove congruence-like properties for these three patterns, in order to show that they can be applied to a subpart of a specification while preserving global properties.

To bypass the network security devices such as firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) and web application firewall, attackers use evasive techniques to circumvent them, of which protocol mimicry is a very useful approach. The technique camouflages malicious communications as common protocols or generally innocent applications to avoid network security audit, which has been widely used in advanced Trojans, botnets, as well as anonymous communication systems, bringing a great challenge to current network management and security. To this end, we propose a general network protocol mimicry behavior discovery framework named MimicHunter to detect such evasive masquerade behaviors, which exploits protocol structure and state transition verifications, as well as primary protocol behavior elements.

The objective function of dynamic voltage support planning is to maximize the yearly average profit of the state without and with additional dynamic voltage support for the power system. The model is able to describe all kinds of voltage instability scenarios caused by REN interior faults or interface failures properly.

These connections go hand in hand with security vulnerabilities and potential threats to these devices. In regular IT systems, we typically provide updates to eliminate vulnerabilities. In industrial automation and control systems, especially in mass production, legacy systems are widespread and installing updates causes downtime. Availability is one of the top goals; stopping a machine in case of a cyber-security threat is often too expensive. But, system integrators and asset owners should not have to wait until product or component suppliers release appropriate updates. Due to safety and warranty requirements, developing and distributing updates can take a long time. In the meantime, attackers can pose threats by taking advantage of devices' known vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose the design of resilient systems based on multi-modal architectures with several operational modes. When vulnerabilities of systems become known, or when systems get even attacked at some point, mode switching can overcome the time between vulnerability disclosure or attack, and the availability of corresponding security patches. Therefore, system integrators and asset owners can actively protect themselves by implicitly or explicitly switching to modes with reduced attack surfaces and, thus, with limited ranges of activity for attackers.

In the dependability domain these techniques are used to measure values much as mean time between failures (MTBF), and to quantify frequency and consequences of risks. The dynamics of security attacks makes it intractable to use, due to the problems with state explosions.To be able to express the complete state space of a security critical system, one needs to consider not only hardware, operating system, and application/services faults, but also the survivability of the system in terms of intentional and accidental security breaches. In this paper, we build a stochastic prediction system to estimate the system integrity of a security critical system. We make use of Colored Petri Nets (CPN), a higher-level-formal-ism for stochastic modeling, analysis, and simulation.

Our project aims at modeling and verifying high-level architectures of critical complex systems, in particular railways systems, that must be validated by domain experts. For that, we propose to combine SYSML and the EVENT-B formal method. To master the complexity of such systems, EVENT-B provides refinement and decomposition mechanisms that allow a step-by-step design and make proofs easier to discharge.

Despite the fast processing speed of symmetric key encryption methods, due to the problem in key exchange, hybrid encryption solves the security problem of key exchange using asymmetric key method. The asymmetric-key method is difficult to provide smooth services due to the decrease in processing speed caused by computational complexity. The hybrid method is designed to take advantage of the fast processing speed of the symmetrickey, and the secure exchange method of the key used in the symmetric- key operates by using the asymmetric-key. However, with the advent of quantum computer technology, encryption techniques using the asymmetric-key method are changing in the same way as increasing the key size used. Therefore, we will explain the AI application method using the state change of Rubik's cube to generate keys in the latest state in the symmetric- key encryption system. The application of the Rubik's cube state change algorithm, which operates on the AI base described in this paper, has the advantage of inducing and using the used key without exchanging the pre-shared key. Because of this key induction method, malicious attackers have little information on the keys used for encryption and decryption, so it is judged that the confidentiality and integrity of key generation and management can be secured more safely. We intend to improve the problem of key exchange and management in existing encryption systems by generating and managing keys through the Rubik's cube state change algorithm, which operates based on AI.","Artificial intelligence; key generation; symmetric-key encryption method; cryptography; Information security","37th International Conference on Information Networking (ICOIN), Bangkok, THAILAND, JAN 11-14, 2023","Jin, J (Corresponding Author), Korea Univ, Inst Cyber Secur & Privacy, Seoul, South Korea.

On this basis, the general in-formation flow is modeled through information mapping between measured state and control command. Furthermore, an equivalent model for a cyber-physical microgrid system is formulated by integrating informa-tion mapping model into the state transition of physical microgrid.

Asymmetric information games are particularly relevant for security problems, e.g., where an attacker knows its own skill set or alternatively a system administrator knows the state of its resources. In such settings, the informed player is faced with the tradeoff of exploiting its superior information at the cost of revealing its superior information. This tradeoff is typically addressed through randomization, in an effort to keep the uninformed player informationally off balance. A lingering issue is the explicit computation of such strategies. This paper, building on prior work for repeated games, presents an LP formulation to compute suboptimal strategies for the informed player in discounted asymmetric information stochastic games in which state transitions are not affected by the uninformed player. Furthermore, the paper presents bounds between the security level guaranteed by the sub-optimal strategy and the optimal value.

However, while migrating to the Cloud platform, a generic notion of their publicly available security policies make it challenging for clients to assess the security threats solely relevant to their applications. Additionally, traditional risk assessment techniques cannot address these challenges as they neither consider cloud security domains as assessment criteria nor identifies critical system resources that need to be protected in the likelihood of a successful attack. In order to address these challenges, this paper presents a risk assessment framework for clients' applications that is characterized by the inclusion of cloud security metrics to perform risk assessment during the design phase of an application by incorporating the techniques of cloud misuse patterns. It also helps improve the security requirements phase that precedes risk assessment, by illustrating clients how different attack scenarios can spread through the applications by using the concepts of percolation centrality and probabilistic state transition diagrams. One of the key findings this work address is how to systematically gain a distinction between multiple system resources belonging to the same security defense priority level.","Cloud computing; Cloud migration; Security risk assessment; Software development lifecycle; Misuse patterns","","Madria, S (Corresponding Author), Missouri Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Rolla, MO 65409 USA.

In this paper, we propose an algebraic approach for modeling and analyzing uniformly several types of network security games. This approach is based on a probabilistic extension of the value-passing Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS), which is a common formal language for modeling concurrent systems. Our approach gives a uniform security model for different security scenarios. We present then a uniform algorithm for computing the Nash equilibria strategies on this security model. In a nutshell, the algorithm first generates a network state transition graph for our security model, then simplifies this transition graph through graph-theoretic abstraction and bisimulation minimization. Then, a backward induction method, which is only applicable to finite tree models, can be used to compute all the Nash equilibria strategies of the (possibly infinite) security models. This algorithm is implemented and can be tuned smoothly for computing its social optimal strategies, and its termination and correctness are proved. The effectiveness and efficiency of this approach are demonstrated with two detailed examples from the field of network security.","Network security; Nash equilibria strategies; Formal method; Probabilistic value-passing CCS","15th IEEE Int Conf on Trust, Security and Privacy in Comp and Commun / 10th IEEE Int Conf on Big Data Science and Engineering / 14th IEEE Int Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Proc with Applicat (IEEE Trustcom/BigDataSE/ISPA), Tianjin, PEOPLES R CHINA, AUG 23-26, 2016","Zhang, Q (Corresponding Author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Software, State Key Lab Comp Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Existing payment token solutions, however, require complex mechanisms for authentication, transaction management, and most importantly, security risk management. In this paper, we present VOLGAPAY, a blockchain-based system that allows merchants to deploy secure offline payment terminal infrastructure that does not require collection and storage of any sensitive data. We design a novel payment protocol which mitigates security threats for all the participants of VOLGAPAY, such that the maximum loss from gaining full access to any component by an adversary incurs only a limited scope of harm. We achieve significant enhancements in security, operation efficiency, and cost reduction via a combination of polynomial multi-hash chain micropayment channels and blockchain grafting for off-chain channel state transition.

In this paper, the deviation of bus voltage magnitude which influences the security operation of power transmission systems is also considered as an objective function. ORPD is typically a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. The proposed HEC algorithm combines basic differential evolution (DE) algorithm and probabilistic state transition rule used in the ant system to deal with the ORPD problem. To verify the performance of the proposed method, the similar evolution approaches such as evolutionary programming (EP) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are also implemented using the same database. The proposed method has been verified on the IEEE 30-bus 6-generator system.

Extensive comparisons with two alternatives are carried out on a sample 33-node hybrid AC/DC distribution system to show the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed FASE, and on a larger 106-node hybrid AC/DC distribution system to demonstrate scalability.","Forecasting-aided state estimation; Deep learning ensemble Kalman filter; Hybrid AC; DC distribution systems","","Huang, MY (Corresponding Author), Hohai Univ, Coll Energy & Elect Engn, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.

Therefore, novel tools that are proactive, agile and continuous are imperative. This article proposes CSBAuditor, a novel cloud security system that continuously monitors cloud infrastructure, to detect malicious activities and unauthorized changes. CSBAuditor leverages two concepts: state transition analysis and reconciler pattern to overcome the aforementioned security issues. Furthermore, security metrics are used to compute severity scores for detected vulnerabilities using a novel scoring system: Cloud Security Scoring System . CSBAuditor has been evaluated using various strategies including security chaos engineering (fault injection) strategies on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.

When launching this kind of attacks, adversaries first compromise a fraction of the targeted system and then move laterally to the rest of the system until the whole system is infected. Various approaches were proposed to study and/or defend against lateral movement-based attacks. However, few of them studied transient behaviors of dynamic attacking and dynamic targeted systems. This paper aims to analyze the transient security of a dynamic network system under lateral movement-based attacks from the time that attack-related abnormity in the system is detected until mechanisms are designed and deployed to defend against attacks. We explore state-space modeling techniques to construct a survivability model for quantitative analysis. A phased piecewise constant approximation approach is also proposed to derive the formulas for calculating model state transient probabilities, with which we derive formulas for calculating metrics of interest. The proposed approach allows both model state transition rates and the number of model states to be time-varying during the system recovery.

This paper views the security level as a user's inherent property that is only correlated with the user's behaviours and the situated context and independent of the suffered attack ways. We propose a formalized methodology to especially quantify the security level in real time from the perspective of state transition probability through estimating the stable probability of staying in the security state in inhomogeneous continuous time Markov chain. This paradigm enables users to customize the security protection mechanisms for adapting to the frequently varying context. We conduct the extensive numerical calculations and empirical analysis to comprehensively investigate the response of the proposed security quantification framework to the various combinations of the concerned parameters, e.g., SNR, velocity, and traffic flow.

Our focus is on a particular level of abstraction, where network messages are represented by a term algebra, protocol execution by state transition systems (e.g. multiset rewrite rules) and where the properties of interest can be analyzed with automated verification tools.We propose models for: (1) the rules guiding the ledger execution, taking the coin functionality of public ledgers such as Bitcoin as an example; (2) the security properties expected from ledger-based zero-knowledge contingent payment protocols; (3) two different security protocols that aim at achieving these properties relying on different ledger infrastructures; (4) reductions that allow simpler term algebras for homomorphic cryptographic schemes. Altogether, these models allow us to derive a first automated verification for ledger-based zero-knowledge contingent payment using the Tamarin prover.

First, we devise a state machine to describe the state transition of BGP nodes and then give a detailed analysis of the BGP failure. Second, on the basis of the preferential attachment characteristic, we propose a cascading failure model for the interdomain routing system, which depicts the production mechanism of cascading failure, and introduce two evaluating indicators, the proportion of failed nodes and the proportion of failed links, to assess the scale of cascading failure. Furthermore, we apply the cascading failure model to display two different cascading failure scenes.

However, the above uncertainties are rarely considered simultaneously in existing study. To this end, a novel system model is proposed to reflect not only the nonlinear characteristics, external disturbances and time-varying delays, but also the randomly occurring deception attacks, which is energy-constrained and lead to the system mode switching. We aim at designing a controller such that the system achieve the prescribed Ho., disturbance rejection level. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and using the stochastic analysis techniques, the addressed controller design problem is transformed to an convex optimization problem, which can be solved by a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. An example is given to show the effectiveness of the designed controller.","Cyber-physical systems; stochastic deception attacks; stabilizing control; time-varying delays; linear matrix inequality","8th International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA, OCT 23-26, 2019","He, J (Corresponding Author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Automat, Xian, Peoples R China.

FSM should be accurately extracted for watermark insertion, FSM-based logic locking, fault injection assessment of control paths in a system-on-chip (SoC), information leakage assessment, and reverse engineering at gate-level. Unfortunately, as of today, there are no good solutions available that can provide very fast and accurate extraction of FSMs from the flattened netlist to perform effective security assessment. The difficulty of developing such a solution lies in precisely identifying FSM state flip-flops present in a netlist that contains numerous circuit flip-flops. In this paper, we propose to develop a framework called FSMx to extract FSMs from highly unstructured synthesized designs. FSMx utilizes graph theory to identify FSM state registers from other registers. FSMx automatically extracts gate-level state transition graphs (STGs) for each of the detected FSM state registers. Experimental results demonstrate that FSMx efficiently recovers FSMs from synthesized netlists with various complexity and size in less than 7 minutes in the worst case of NIST AES 128-bit design with 12,976 gates on a personal desktop.","FSM Extraction; Flattened Gate-Level Netlist Analysis; Security Validation; FSM Automata Theory","40th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium (VTS), ELECTR NETWORK, APR 25-27, 2022","Kibria, R (Corresponding Author), Univ Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.

The optical shielding properties and phase state transition of PS layers enable high-level encoding and decoding security through thermal activation of light transmittance control. Meanwhile, the CdS layer can be clearly revealed in decoding mode because of the high refractive index. Besides, the confinement protection of integrated TPU films prevents the trilayer quasi-amorphous heterostructure from damage. To establish the practical advantage, portable information carriers can be prepared for camouflage. Accordingly, the reliable encoding and decoding system, and ability to integrate with easy-to-carry products, make our composites a potentially high-security encryption device for anti-fraud technology.","quasi-amorphous structures; structural color; encryption","","Tang, BT (Corresponding Author), Dalian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Fine Chem, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.

Collaborative robots may offer a solution; however, these systems only comply with safety standards if operating at reduced speeds. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and implementation of a novel security system that allows human-robot coexistence while permitting the robot to execute much of its task at nominal speed. Design/methodology/approach - The security system is defined by three modes: a nominal mode, a coexistence mode and a gravity compensation mode. Mode transition is triggered by three lasers, two of which are mechanically linked to the robot. These scanners create a dynamic envelope around the robot and allow the detection of operator presence or environmental changes. To avoid velocity discontinuities between transitions, the authors propose a novel time scaling method. Findings - The paper describes the system's mechanical, software and control architecture. The system is demonstrated experimentally on a collaborative robot and is compared with the performance of a state-of-art security system. Both a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the new system is carried out. Practical implications - The mode transition method is easily implemented, requires little computing power and leaves the trajectories unchanged. As velocity discontinuities are avoided, motor wear is reduced. The execution time is substantially less than a commercial alternative. These advantages can lead to economic benefits in high-volume manufacturing environments. Originality/value - This paper proposes a novel system that is based on industrial material but can generate dynamic safety zones for a collaborative robot.","Robotics; Safety; Flexible manufacturing; Human-robot interaction; Collaborative robots","","Long, P (Corresponding Author), Northeastern Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA.

In terms of market demand, the load duration curve technology is employed to predict the amount of demand. Then, the indicator proposed to quantify gas supply reliability is calculated on each trial. Finally, the average gas supply reliability is obtained based on N Monte Carlo trials. Applications of this methodology are demonstrated through a real transmission pipeline system.

AnBx offers channels as the main abstraction for communication, providing different authenticity and/or confidentiality guarantees for message transmission. AnBx extends existing proposals in the literature with a novel notion of forwarding channels, enforcing specific security guarantees from the message originator to the final recipient along a number of intermediate forwarding agents. We give a formal semantics of AnBx in terms of a state transition system expressed in the AVISPA Intermediate Format.

In stochastic dynamic games, learning is more challenging because, while learning, the decision makers alter the state of the system and hence the future cost. In this paper, we present decentralized Q-learning algorithms for stochastic games, and study their convergence for the weakly acyclic case which includes team problems as an important special case. The algorithms are decentralized in that each decision maker has access only to its own decisions and cost realizations as well as the state transitions; in particular, each decision maker is completely oblivious to the presence of the other decision makers.

The supply reliability evaluation of multi-product pipeline systems can improve the effective response to unexpected disruptions and guarantee the reliable oil supply. Based on reliability theory and pipeline scheduling method, an integrated supply reliability evaluation methodology for multi-product pipeline systems is proposed in this paper and the pumps failure, of which influence is the most complex, is focused on. In the methodology, the discrete-time Markov process is adopted to describe the stochastic failure and the Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the system states transition. With the pipeline flowrate upper limits under various pumps failure scenarios optimized in advance, the maximum supply capacity to the downstream markets in each trial is calculated by the pipeline scheduling model. Three indicators are also developed to analyze the pipeline supply reliability from the holistic and individual perspectives. At last, the methodology application is performed on a real-world multi-product pipeline system in China and the supply reliability is analyzed in detail according to the simulation results. It is proved to provide a practical method for the emergency response decision-making and loss prevention.","Multi-product pipeline; Supply reliability analysis; Pumps failure; Stochastic process simulation; Pipeline scheduling method; Evaluation indicators","","Zhou, XY (Corresponding Author), China Univ Petr, Beijing Key Lab Urban Oil & Gas Distribut Technol, Natl Engn Lab Pipeline Safety, Fuxue Rd 18, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.

Then, a distributed robust energy and reserve dispatch approach is proposed, wherein the flexible resources in different systems are coordinated in the normal and uncertainty cases to enhance the overall economic efficiency and reliability. Apart from generation resources, air conditioning loads integrated by the aggregated virtual energy storage (AVES) model are incorporated.

The agent is capable of turning the sensors for events on and off dynamically, depending on the trajectory of the system. Reading data from the sensors may be costly so it is imperative that their use be reduced for reasons such as energy, bandwidth or security. When a sensor for an event is on / active any occurrence of the event is detected by the agent and is not detected otherwise. The agent may employ different sensor activation policies, depending on the task at hand. Sensor activation policies are defined over the transitions of a state-transition representation of the system. From sensor activation policies a map from observed event sequences to sensor activation decisions can be computed which the agent can use to determine which sensors to turn on / off and when. In this paper, we consider two subclasses of sensor activation policies of increasing generality. For each subclass, we demonstrate ways to compute maps from observed event sequences to sensor activation decisions in polynomial time.","","52nd IEEE Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), Florence, ITALY, DEC 10-13, 2013","Sears, D (Corresponding Author), Queens Univ, Sch Comp, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.

The concept of resilience is introducing to measure the ability of the system to maintain its function under attack. It matters in evaluating the security of modern industrial systems. This paper presents a 3D Resilience State Space method to assess Communication-based train control (CBTC) system resilience under malware attack. We model the spread of malware as two functions: the communicability function f(x) and the susceptibility function g(x). We describe the characteristics of these two function in the CBTC complex network by using the percolation theory. Then we use a perturbation formalism to analyze the impact of malware attack on information flow and use it as an indicator of the cyber layer state. The CBTC cyber-physical system resilience metric formalizes as the system state transitions in three-dimensional state space. The three dimensions respectively represent the cyber layer state, the physical layer state, and the transmission layer state. The simulation results reveal that the proposed framework can effectively assess the resilience of the CBTC system. And the anti-malware programs can prevent the spread of malware and improve CBTC system resilience.","","IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC), Indianapolis, IN, SEP 19-22, 2021","Zhao, JY (Corresponding Author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Rail Traff Control & Safety, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.

This model regards the incomplete information of the attacker and the defender as the defender's uncertainty about the attacker's type and uses the Double Deep Q-Network algorithm to solve the problem of the difficulty of determining the network state transition probability, so that the network system can dynamically adjust the defense strategy. Finally, a simulation experiment was performed on the proposed model.

However, many of these solutions stop at triggering the security measure and give little thought to amending it. As a consequence, once the violation is addressed, no clear path exists for reinstating the flagged client beyond having the network operator reset the controller or manually implement a state change via an external command. This presents a burden for the network and its clients and administrators.

Once events are triggered by an attacker's action or system response, the current states of the vulnerabilities are known. Then we calculate the transition probabilities of the vulnerability from the current state to security failure state. Furthermore in order to improve accuracy of our algorithms, we adjust the probabilities that they exploit the vulnerability according to the attacker's skill level. In the light of the preconditions and post-conditions of vulnerabilities in the network, attack graph is built to visualize security situation in real time. Subsequently, we predict attack path, recognize attack intention and estimate the impact through analysis of attack graph. These help administrators to insight into intrusion steps, determine security state and assess threat.

This approach highlights some issues of the Bluetooth encryption such as the invertibility of its state transition map, a special set of 14 bits of its 132-bit state which when guessed implies linear equations among the other bits and finally a small number of spurious keys, with 83 guessed bits, which are compatible with a keystream of about 60 bits. Exploiting these issues, we implement an algebraic attack using Grobner bases, SAT solvers and Binary Decision Diagrams. Testing activities suggest that the version based on Grobner bases is the best one and it is able to attack E0 in about 279 seconds on an Intel i9 CPU.

MongoDB replica sets consist of a primary that accepts all client writes and then propagates those writes to the secondaries. Each member of the replica set contains the same set of data. For horizontal partitioning, each shard (or partition) is a replica set. This paper discusses the design and rationale behind MongoDB's implementation of a cluster-wide logical clock and causal consistency. The design leveraged ideas from across the research community to ensure that the implementation adds minimal processing overhead, tolerates possible operator errors, and gives protection against non-trusted client attacks. While the goal of the team was not to discover or test new algorithms, the practical implementation necessitated a novel combination of ideas from the research community on causal consistency, security, and minimal performance overhead at scale. This paper describes a large scale, practical implementation of causal consistency using a hybrid logical clock, adding the signing of logical time ranges to the protocol, and introducing performance optimizations necessary for systems at scale.

There are certain process monitoring methods and the recently proposed ones are based on state changes of process artifacts or places, however, they do not mention defending process interactions from outer tampering, where events could not be detected by process systems, or saving fault-handling time. In this paper, we propose a novel Token-based Interaction Monitoring framework based on token carried data to safeguard process collaboration and reduce problem solving time. Token is a more common data entity in processes than process artifacts and they cover all tasks' executions. Comparing to detecting places' state change, we set security checking points at both when tokens are just produced and to be consumed. This will ensure that even if data is tampered after being created it would be detected before being used. For applying monitoring framework, we develop a collaboration constructing method with token-based process mining techniques to derive global interaction processes as well as organize historical process data in forms of token.","Monitoring; Collaboration; Internet; Data mining; Data models; Web services; Web services; collaboration construct; process reengineering methodology; business process monitoring; Data models","","Li, CY (Corresponding Author), Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Software Inst, Nanjing 210000, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

As technology and grid infrastructure evolve to develop more advanced WAPAC applications, however, so do the attack surfaces in the grid infrastructure. This paper presents an attack-resilient system (ARS) for the WAPAC cybersecurity by seamlessly integrating the network intrusion detection system (NIDS) with intrusion mitigation and prevention system (IMPS). In particular, the proposed NIDS utilizes signature and behavior-based rules to detect attack reconnaissance, communication failure, and data integrity attacks. Further, the proposed IMPS applies state transition-based mitigation and prevention strategies to quickly restore the normal grid operation after cyberattacks. As a proof of concept, we validate the proposed generic architecture of ARS by performing experimental case study for wide-area protection scheme (WAPS), one of the critical WAPAC applications, and evaluate the proposed NIDS and IMPS components of ARS in a cyber-physical testbed environment.

Given a set of access control policies, a general safety requirement in such a system is to determine whether a desirable property is satisfied in all the reachable states. Such an analysis calls for the use of formal verification techniques. While formal analysis on traditional Role Based Access Control (RBAC) has been done to some extent, recent extensions to RBAC lack such an analysis. In this paper, we consider the temporal RBAC extensions and propose a formal technique using timed automata to perform security analysis by analyzing both safety and liveness properties. Using safety properties one ensures that something bad never happens while liveness properties show that some good state is also achieved. GTRBAC is a well accepted generalized temporal RBAC model which can handle a wide range of temporal constraints while specifying different access control policies. Analysis of such a model involves a process of mapping a GTRBAC based system into a state transition system. Different reduction rules are proposed to simplify the modeling process depending upon the constraints supported by the system. The effect of different constraints on the modeling process is also studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Different from previous approaches, the proposed method accurately evaluates the annual cost and benefits obtainable by FACTS devices installation by formulating a large-scale optimization problem that contains power flow analyses for a large number of system states representing annual power system operations. In addition, dynamic state transitions caused by specified contingencies are also simulated in the optimization problem to evaluate the effect of FACTS control actions as well as the other coordinated controls. The expected cost consists of operating cost under normal and contingency states along with their related probabilities to occur. Maximizing social welfare is the objective for normal state while minimizing compensations for generations re-scheduling and load shedding as well as maximizing social welfare are the objectives in case of contingency.

In addition, the approach considers state transitions taken by the attacker to model the steps of a multi-stage attack to reach to its final goal.

Analysis of the current operating state and prediction of plausible future insecurity is crucial for real-time decision-making and implementation of necessary control strategies to ensure secure operation of bulk power systems. On-line security assessment demands low complexity and computational time. The traditional methods of assessment of dynamic security of electric power systems often prove to be inadequate for online and real-time conditions due to their high complexity and long computation time. This article proposes a pattern recognition approach to dynamic security analysis for large and complex power systems using ensemble decision tree to form reliable decision rules for fast and accurate prediction of power system's operating states in a real-time and on-line environment. An ensemble security predictor (ENSP) was developed and trained to act as ``dynamic security state predictor'' to predict and classify power system's dynamic operating states into secure, insecure, and intermediate transitional classes. Two different case studies were performed on IEEE 118-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed method on systems of varying size and complexity. While prediction accuracy of some of the single-learner classifiers decreased considerably when implemented on a large sized system, the performance of ENSP declined marginally, and the results were acceptable for very large sized systems.","Security; Power system stability; Power system dynamics; Decision trees; Real-time systems; Feature extraction; Training; Classification; dynamic security; ensemble decision tree; feature extraction; feature selection; pattern recognition; power system transient stability; prediction","","De, AB (Corresponding Author), Indian Inst Engn Sci & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Sibpur 711103, W Bengal, India.

In this research, we develop a finite-horizon semi-Markov general-sum game between the defender (i.e., plant operator) and the attacker to obtain the time-sensitive attack response strategy and the real-time risk assessment in nuclear power plants. We propose methods for identifying system states of concern to reduce the state space and for determining state transition probabilities by integrating probabilistic risk assessment techniques. After a proper discretization of the developed continuous-time model, we use dynamic programming to derive the time-varying and state-dependent strategy of the defender based on the solution concept of the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. For risk assessment, three risk metrics are considered, and an exact analytical algorithm and a Monte Carlo simulation-based algorithm for obtaining the metrics are developed. Both players' strategies and the risk metrics are illustrated using a digital feedwater control system used in pressurized water reactors. The results show that the proposed method can support plant operators in timely cyber-attack response and effective risk assessment, reduce the risk, and improve the resilience of nuclear power plants to malicious cyber-attacks.","Cyber-attack response; Game theory; Semi-Markov decision process; Dynamic programming; Probabilistic risk assessment; Nuclear power plant; Feedwater control system; Non-stationary strategy","","Zhao, YF (Corresponding Author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Nucl Engn Program, 201 W 19th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.

The security metrics are developed to measure the dynamics of a network and a host state's information (e.g., IP address, port, software stacks, vulnerabilities, or network topology) introduced by various types of MTD techniques shuffling them. The key aspect of our proposed metrics is to capture variability that keeps track of changing patterns of the network and the host states upon every MTD triggering event. In this work, we propose the following security metrics capturing the variability based on the changes made by the MTD: (1) Network and host address-based metrics measuring variability of the network and host addresses based on a degree of uncertainty and unpredictability on the assigned IP address to the hosts in a network; (2) Attack path-based metrics measuring variability of attack paths using graphical models estimated based on the network state transitions from one topology to another topology upon triggering a network topology and/or IP shuffling MTD; and (3) Attack stage-based success metrics measuring the chances of discovering a vulnerable target host's information, exploiting the target host's vulnerability, and compromising the target host. Via extensive simulation study, we investigated the key parameters that can significantly affect the MTD performance based on the proposed security metrics.

Firstly, the 5G system, state transition properties and security properties were abstracted from 3GPP specifications. To mimic an attacker's behavior, a Dolev-Yao adversary model was constructed in the 5G model by empowering it with NAS signalling security testing knowledge and reasonable security capabilities in the wireless channel. Then we used the TAMARIN prover to verify all the abstracted properties one by one and discovered some protocol vulnerabilities based on the counterexamples found. We further verified these vulnerabilities on the testbed and identified 10 new 5G protocol vulnerabilities. Moreover, we analyzed the root cause of these vulnerabilities and concluded that all of them were caused by the unconditional trust between UE and gNodeB. Therefore, we propose an improved PKI mechanism based on the existing asymmetric encryption of 5G. Besides the existing public-private key pair of the home network, we introduce a new pair of asymmetric keys in the gNodeB to encrypt and sign the signalling message sent to UE. The gNodeB can be connected only when the verification succeeds and then the RRC connection can be initiated. This mechanism can effectively avoid all the vulnerabilities found in this paper.","5G; protocol security; privacy; NAS; formal method; public key infrastructure","","Hu, XX (Corresponding Author), Natl Digital Switching Syst Engn & Technol Res Ct, Zhengzhou 450002, Henan, Peoples R China.

These vulnerabilities can be created by improper designs or by the synthesis tool which introduces additional don't-care states and transitions during the optimization and synthesis process. An attacker can utilize these vulnerabilities to perform fault injection attacks or insert malicious hardware modifications (Trojan) to gain unauthorized access to some specific states. To our knowledge, no systematic approaches have been proposed to analyze these vulnerabilities in FSM. In this paper, we develop a framework named Analyzing Vulnerabilities in FSM (AVFSM) which extracts the state transition graph (including the don't-care states and transitions) from a gate-level netlist using a novel Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) based approach and quantifies the vulnerabilities of the design to fault injection and hardware Trojan insertion.

Prior works require multiple access points (AP) deployed in the tracking region or to utilize elaborately selected multipaths in an indoor environment to achieve tracking. However, this prevents their wide adoption because scenarios like homes typically only have a single AP, and using multipaths is vulnerable to unexpected interferences due to the complex indoor environment. This paper proposes a tracking system using only a single AP. The insight behind the proposed system is to mine the multi-dimensional channel parameters from the direct path to realize tracking. Therefore, we develop a model that establishes the correlation between the target motion and channel parameters, including the direct path's angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD). Then, we can formulate the tracking problem as the state transition with the observations. Since the nonlinear observation equation, we use particle filters to solve the problem accurately. Finally, we validate the proposed system via simulation using ray-tracing software. The simulation results show that the median tracking error is 0.21 m based on a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), comparable to previous state-of-the-art systems.","Indoor tracking; single access point; wireless channel model; direct path; particle filter","33rd IEEE Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC), ELECTR NETWORK, SEP 12-15, 2022","Dong, WX (Corresponding Author), Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Commun & Informat Engn, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China.

The agent is capable of turning the sensors for events on and off dynamically, depending on the trajectory of the system. Reading data from the sensors may be costly so it is imperative that their use be reduced for reasons such as energy, bandwidth or security. When a sensor for an event is on / active any occurrence of the event is detected by the agent and is not detected otherwise. The agent may employ different sensor activation policies, depending on the task at hand. Sensor activation policies are defined over the transitions of a state-transition representation of the system. From sensor activation policies a map from observed event sequences to sensor activation decisions can be computed which the agent can use to determine which sensors to turn on / off and when. In this paper, we consider a subclass of sensor activation policies. For this subclass, we demonstrate a way to compute maps from observed event sequences to sensor activation decisions in polynomial time. However, we demonstrate that verifying if an arbitrary sensor activation policy belongs to this subclass is PSPACE-complete.","","52nd IEEE Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), Florence, ITALY, DEC 10-13, 2013","Sears, D (Corresponding Author), Queens Univ, Sch Comp, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada.

Software that heavily interacts with the underlying OS (e.g., I/O intensive and event-driven applications) suffers from system call overhead. To deteriorate this situation, security vulnerabilities in modern processors have prompted kernel mitigations that further increase the transition overhead. Particularly system-call-heavy applications have been reported to be slowed down by up to 30% with kernel page-table isolation (KPTI), the widely deployed mitigation for the Meltdown vulnerability. To decouple system calls from mode transitions, we revisit an old idea known as system-call hatching or multi-calls: the bundling of system calls into a combined call, which only incurs the mode-transition costs of a single one. And then, we have implemented ESCA scheme to adapt system-call hatching to Linux-based servers in the light of Meltdown and Spectre, effectively eliminating the slowdown of KPTI-affected applications. Our evaluation shows that the throughputs of real-world applications, benefiting from MCA, can be improved with only 2 lines of code changed respectively: Nginx by up to 12%, lighttpd by up to 23%, and Redis by 4%.

In order to estimate the transition intensities a special Markov chain embedded in the observed capacity process was defined. By using this technique, all transition intensities can be estimated from the observed realization of the unit generating capacity stochastic process. The proposed multi-state Markov model was used to calculate important reliability indices such as the Forced Outage Rate (FOR), the Expected Energy Not Supplied (EENS) to consumers, etc. These indices were found for short-time periods (about 100 h). It was shown that these indices are sensibly different from those calculated for a long-term range.

In this paper, we consider the problem of enforcing opacity in systems modeled as partially-observed finite-state automata. We propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output of the system that changes the system's output behavior by inserting additional observable events. We define the property of ``i-enforceability'' that an insertion function needs to satisfy in order to enforce opacity. I-enforceability captures an insertion function's ability to respond to every system's observed behavior and to output only modified behaviors that look like existing non-secret behaviors. Given an insertion function, we provide an algorithm that verifies whether it is i-enforcing. More generally, given an opacity notion, we determine whether it is i-enforceable or not by constructing a structure called the ``All Insertion Structure'' (AIS). The AIS enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in a compact state transition structure. If a given opacity notion has been verified to be i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to synthesize an i-enforcing insertion function. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to protect ICS from malicious attacks, intrusion detection technology emerges. By analyzing the network meta data or the industrial process data, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can identify attacks that violate communication protocols or system specifications. However, the existing intrusion detection technology is not omnipotent, which opens up a back door for some more advanced attacks. In this work, we design an enhanced multi-stage semantic attack against ICS, which is undetectable by existing IDS. By hijacking the communication channels between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the remote Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), the attacker can manipulate the measurement data and control instructions simultaneously. The fake measurement data deceives the human operator into making wrong decisions. Furthermore, the attacker can strategically manipulate the semantic meaning of control instructions according to system state transition rules. In the meanwhile, a fake view of measurement data is presented to the HMI to conceal the on-going malicious attack. This attack is totally stealthy since the message sizes and timing, the command sequences, and the system state values are all legitimate. Consequently, this attack can secretly bring the system into critical states. Experimental results have verified the strong attack ability of the proposed attack.","Integrated circuits; Intrusion detection; Protocols; Semantics; Industrial control; Industrial control systems; multi-stage semantic attacks; state transition; stealthy attacks","","Hu, Y (Corresponding Author), Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

A large majority of hardware H's comes in Register Transfer Level (RTL) description due to their portability and flexibility to map to any technology platform. In this paper, we propose a key-based security through obscurity approach for protecting RTL hardware IPs. The RTL design is first transformed into a technology-independent gate-level description and The functionality of the resulting gate-level netlist is then changed through modification of its state transition function. This process allows normal operation only on the successful application of a correct initialization sequence. The modified gate-level design is then decompiled to generate an obfuscated version of the RTL. Major RTL constructs and macros are optionally preserved through the transformation process using a forward annotation file. The proposed methodology differs from existing hardware obfuscation as well as watermarking techniques in its ability to achieve simultaneous functional and semantic obfuscation for RTL description of IP at low design overhead. Simulation results for a set of open-source IP cores show that we can achieve high levels of security through a well-formulated obfuscation scheme incurring nominal area, delay and power overhead.","Hardware IP Protection; IP piracy; RTL obfuscation","IEEE International Workshop on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust, San Francisco, CA, JUL 27, 2009","Chakraborty, RS (Corresponding Author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.

It will have a severe impact on train control operation efficiency.

In the cyber layer, a multi-stage and zero-sum stochastic game model is built for the channel selection for the attack and the defense, whereby the channel selection randomized policy will be obtained.

Once established the features for such states, we focus on Deep Neural Networks as security methods to mitigate the impact of cyber-attacks on the power grid by providing a case study simulation in MATLAB to sustain the proposed method.","power grid; cyber-physical systems; deep neural networks; power grid; cyber-attacks; security; impact analysis","","Dogaru, DI (Corresponding Author), Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Fac Automat Control & Comp Sci, Bucharest, Romania.

The Software-Defined Networking (SDN) simplifies the network design and operation, and offers new opportunities (programmability, flexibility, dynamicity, and standardization) to manage the network. Despite this, the access control management remains a challenge, once managing security policies involves dealing with a large set of access control rules, detecting conflicting policies, defining priorities, delegating rights, and reacting against network state changes and events. This work presents the HACFlow, a novel, autonomic, and policy-based framework for access control management in OpenFlow networks. HACFlow aims to simplify and automate the network management allowing network operators to govern rights of network entities by defining dynamic, fine-grained, and high-level access control policies.

Moving target defense, as an effective defense means, is constantly developing. It is difficult to effectively characterize an MTD attack and defense game with existing game models and effectively select the defense timing to balance SDN service quality and MTD decision-making benefits. From the hidden confrontation between the actual attack and defense sides, existing attack-defense scenarios are abstractly characterized and analyzed. Based on the APT attack process of the Cyber Kill Chain (CKC), a state transition model of the MTD attack surface based on the susceptible-infective-recuperative-malfunctioned (SIRM) infectious disease model is defined. An MTD attack-defense timing decision model based on the FlipIt game (FG-MTD) is constructed, which expands the static analysis in the traditional game to a dynamic continuous process. The Nash equilibrium of the proposed method is analyzed, and the optimal timing selection algorithm of the MTD is designed to provide decision support for the selection of MTD timing under moderate security. Finally, the application model is used to verify the model and method.

It characterizes whether a''secret'' of a system can be inferred by an outside observer called an'' intruder.'' We consider the problem of enforcing opacity in partially-observed discrete event systems modeled as automata. We propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output of the system that changes the system's output behavior by inserting additional observable events. The insertion function must respond to the full system's output behavior. Also, the insertion function should not create new observed behavior but only replicate existing observable strings. We define the property of `` i-enforceability,'' when there exists an insertion function that renders a non-opaque system opaque. To synthesize insertion functions that ensure opacity, we define and construct a new structure called the'' All Insertion Structure'' (AIS). The AIS can be used to verify if a given opacity property is i-enforceable. The AIS enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in a compact state transition structure. If a given opacity property has been verified to be i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to synthesize an i-enforcing insertion function.","","51st IEEE Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), HI, DEC 10-13, 2012","Wu, YC (Corresponding Author), Univ Michigan, Dept EECS, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.

The MWSLS scheme can select the link with the largest weight among all secure and available source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links. By modeling the dynamic buffer state transitions as a Markov chain, we derive the closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability, the secrecy diversity gain, the average secrecy throughput and the end to end delay, which provide a comprehensive and effective way to evaluate the impacts of different parameters on the secrecy performance. The results of this paper reveal that: 1) For the case with small buffer sizes, a significant enhancement on the secrecy outage performance can be observed compared with the popular max-link secure link selection (MLSLS) scheme. 2) When L >= 3, the secrecy diversity gain of the system can achieve 2M, while the MLSLS scheme achieves the same secrecy diversity gain only when L -> infinity (where M denotes the number of relays and L is the buffer size). 3) The MWSLS scheme outperforms the MLSLS scheme in terms of the average secrecy throughput and the end to end delay in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, and obtain the same performance as the latter in the high SNR regime.","Buffer-aided relay; physical layer security; max-weight secure link selection; secrecy performance","","Yang, WD (Corresponding Author), Army Engn Univ PLA, Coll Commun Engn, Nanjing 210007, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

In general, however, the cost is the loss of sequence between events: the sequence of events is compiled into the connection of events, so there may be potential omissions throughout the system reliability analysis process and analysis results. To remedy this problem, in this paper we outline an analysis approach that converts failure behavioural models (GTS) to temporal fault trees (TFTs), which can then be analysed using Pandora a recent technique for introducing temporal logic to fault trees. The approach is compositional and potentially more scalable, as it relies on the synthesis of large system TFTs from smaller component TFTs.

The need for built-in protection mechanisms, at all levels of design, is paramount to providing cost-effective, efficient, secure systems. In this work, Securely derived Finite State Machines (S*FSM) and power-aware S*FSM are proposed and studied. Overall results show that to provide an S*FSM, the typical FSM requires a 50% increase in the number of states and a 57% increase in the number of product terms needed to define the state transitions. These increases translate to a minimum encoding space increase of 70%, raising the average encoding length from 4.8 bits to 7.9 bits. When factoring in relaxed structural constraints for power and space mitigation, the respective increases of 53 and 67% raise the average number of bits needed to 7.3 and 7.9. Regarding power savings, current minimisation is possible for both FSMs and S*FSMs through the addition of encoding constraints with average current reductions of 30 and 70%, respectively. Overall, a power-constrained S*FSM consumes about 5% more power than insecure FSMs with binary encodings, though with a penalty of a 95% increase in layout area.","encoding; protocols; finite state machines; telecommunication security; information leakage; critical communication; protection mechanisms; secure systems; average encoding length; relaxed structural constraints; space mitigation; binary encodings; finite state machines","","Borowczak, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Wyoming, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.

However, multiple factors cause a long delay and large errors in wind power prediction. Hence, efficient wind power forecasting approaches are still required for practical applications. In this paper, a new wind power forecasting method based on Chaos Theory and Bernstein Neural Network (BNN) is proposed. Firstly, the largest Lyapunov exponent as a judgment for wind power system's chaotic behavior is made. Secondly, Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR) is used to reconstruct the wind power series' phase space. Thirdly, the prediction model is constructed using the Bernstein polynomial and neural network. Finally, the weights and thresholds of the model are optimized by Primal Dual State Transition Algorithm (PDSTA). The practical hourly data of wind power generation in Xinjiang is used to test this forecaster. The proposed forecaster is compared with several current prominent research findings. Analytical results indicate that the forecasting error of PDSTA BNN is 3.893% for 24 look-ahead hours, and has lower errors obtained compared with the other forecast methods discussed in this paper.

Therefore, development of effective solutions that can protect both CPS data and data exchange networks are extremely urgent. This study makes some improvements on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and provides a critical analysis of the feasibility of using blockchain technology to protect constrained CPS data. It also justifies the choice of the improved PBFT for implementation on such devices and simulates the main distributed ledger scenarios. The improved PBFT works as follows: first, the client broadcasts the signed transaction data to the entire network, rather than just the master node, followed by a hash value comparison verification process; second, select the master node based on the longest chain principle, and punish the malicious node via the ``blacklist'' mechanism; third, add the data synchronization and verification process, as well as dynamically entering and leaving nodes via state transitions. Ultimately, the PBFT commit phase is eliminated, resulting in a two-stage process.

So for this paper, a controllable thermosensitive neuron model is established by paralleling two thermistors in the FitzHugh-Nagumo neural circuit. Especially, the thermistors are controlled by two switches, where three working modes can be selected, for which bifurcation diagrams, time response diagrams and spectral entropy (SE) complexity are used to analyze the dynamic behaviors in different operating modes. It is found that any modulation of thermistor can regulate the branch current and output voltage completely under the three working modes. More importantly, the neuronal activities show different mode transitions from periodic to bursts or chaos. The superior dynamic characteristics and rich firing behavior make the new model more suitable for images encryption. For this purpose, we consider switching the three thermosensitive neuron models continuously to obtain more complex chaotic sequences. Next, based on the feature of high pixel correlation among color image components, a 3D projection scrambling algorithm is designed, and then employed in combination with the universal gravitational diffusion method to propose a color image encryption scheme. In addition, the designed algorithm is executed by encrypting and decrypting some color images. The experimental results show that the algorithm cannot only encrypt the color image effectively, but also has no limitation on the size of the test image. It is worth mentioning that the designed encrypted algorithm has satisfactory security performance and considerable robustness against noise attacks and shearing attacks. The exploration of this paper about the thermosensitive neuron model and its application may provide some theoretical guidance and experimental basis in the field of secure communication.","Thermosensitive neuron; continuous switching system; color image encryption; 3D projection confusion; gravitational diffusion","","Yang, FF (Corresponding Author), Lanzhou Univ Technol, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Lanzhou 730050, Peoples R China.

While many intrusion detection systems (IDSes) have been adapted to monitor ICS, they cannot detect malicious network packets from a compromised PLC that conform to the network protocol. A domain expert needs to manually construct IDS rules to model a PLC's behavior. That approach is time-consuming and error-prone. Alternatively, machine learning can infer a PLC's behavior model from network traces, but that model may be inaccurate due to a lack of high-quality training data. This paper presents CoToRu - a toolchain that takes in the PLC's code to automatically generate a comprehensive set of IDS rules. CoToRu comprises (1) an analyzer that parses PLC code to build a state transition table for modeling the PLC's behavior, and (2) a generator that instantiates IDS rules for detecting deviations in PLC behavior. The generated rules can be imported into Zeek IDS to detect various attacks. We apply CoToRu to a power grid testbed and show that our generated rules provide superior performance compared to existing IDSes, including those based on statistical analysis, invariant-checking, and machine learning. Our prototype with CoToRu's generated rules provide sub-millisecond detection latency, even for complex PLC logic.","","41st IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM), ELECTR NETWORK, MAY 02-05, 2022","Tan, HC (Corresponding Author), Adv Digital Sci Ctr, Singapore, Singapore.

The flexibility provided by the N-variants enables a number of important tasks, including IP protection, IP metering, security, design optimization, self-adaptation and fault-tolerance. The method is based on extending the finite state machine (FSM) of the design to include multiple variants of the same design specification. The state transitions are managed by added signals that may come from various triggers depending on the target application. We devise an algorithm for implementing the N-variant IC design. We discuss the necessary manipulations of the added signals that would facilitate the various tasks. The key advantage to integrating the heterogeneity in the functional specification of the design is that we can configure the variants during or post-manufacturing, but removal, extraction or deletion of the variants is not viable. Experimental results on benchmark circuits demonstrate that the method can be automatically and efficiently implemented. Because of its lightweight, N-variant design is particularly well-suited for securing embedded systems. As a proof-of-concept, we implement the N-variant method for content protection in portable media players, e.g., iPod.

In simple terms, DT is described as a virtual replica of a given physical product, system, or process. It consists of three major segments: the physical entity, its virtual counterpart, and the connections between them. While the data is collected from a physical entity, processed at the virtual layer, and accessed in the form of a DT at the application layer, it is exposed to several security risks. To ensure the applicability of a DT system, it is imperative to understand these security risks and their implications. However, there is a lack of a framework that can be used to assess the security of a DT. This paper presents a framework in which the security of a DT can be analyzed with the help of a formal verification technique. The framework captures the defense of the system at different layers and considers various attacks at each layer. The security of the DT system is represented as a state-transition system and the security properties are captured in temporal logic. Probabilistic model checking (PMC) is used to verify the systems against these properties. In particular, the framework is used to analyze the probability of success and the cost of various potential attacks that can occur at each layer in a DT system. The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated with the help of a detailed case study in the healthcare domain.","Digital twin security; security analysis; probabilistic model checking; Markov decision process; discrete time Markov chain","","Al-Ali, AR (Corresponding Author), Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.

Rather than exploiting an incorrect implementation of the ISA, these attacks leverage the undocumented implementationspecific speculation behavior of high-performance microarchitectures to affect the extra-architectural state of the machine (e. g., caches). Inspired by these novel speculation-based attacks, we argue it is time to rethink the traditional ISA layers. Programmers and security professionals need a framework to reason about the effects of speculation and other microarchitectural performance optimizations. We propose judiciously extending the ISA to include the extraarchitectural state so that an ISA implementation either completely squashes all system state changes caused by mis-speculated instructions or the potential changes are rigorously documented.

However, the actual offloading situations are more complex than synchronous offloading following the first-come, first-served rule. In this paper, we study a polling callback energy-saving offloading strategy, that is, the arrival time of data transmission and task processing time are asynchronous. Under the constraints of task processing time, the time-sharing MEC data transmission problem is modeled as the total energy consumption minimization model. Using the semi-closed form optimization technology, energy consumption optimization is transformed into two subproblems: computation (data partition) and transmission (time division). To reduce the computational complexity of offloading computation under time-varying channel conditions, we propose a game-learning algorithm, that combines DDQN and distributed LMST with intermediate state transition (named DDQNL-IST). DDQNL-IST combines distributed LSTM and double-Q learning as part of the approximator to improve the ability of processing and predicting time intervals and delays in time series. The proposed DDQNL-IST algorithm ensures rationality and convergence. Finally, the simulation results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than the DDQN, DQN and BCD-based optimal methods. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, existing software and even hardware approaches for finding and identifying memory bugs have considerable performance overheads, target only a narrow class of bugs, are costly to implement, or use computational resources inefficiently. This paper describes MemTracker, a new hardware support mechanism that can be configured to perform different kinds of memory access monitoring tasks. MemTracker associates each word of data in memory with a few bits of state, and uses a programmable state transition table to react to different events that can affect this state. The number of state bits per word, the events to which MemTracker reacts, and the transition table are all fully programmable. MemTracker's rich set of states, events, and transitions can be used to implement different monitoring and debugging checkers with minimal performance overheads, even when frequent state updates are needed. To evaluate MemTracker, we map three different checkers onto it, as well as a checker that combines all three. For the most demanding (combined) checker, we observe performance overheads of only 2.7% on average and 4.8% worst-case on SPEC 2000 applications. Such low overheads allow continuous (always-on) use of MemTracker-enabled checkers even in production runs.","","13th International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture, Phoenix, AZ, FEB 10-14, 2007","Venkataramani, G (Corresponding Author), Georgia Tech, Atlanta, GA USA.

With reference to it, several trust-based schemes have been proposed by researchers. However, the prevailing schemes require high computational power and memory space; which weakens the network integrity and control.

However, significant issues w.r.t. system throughput, transaction confidentiality, and the security guarantee of the DApp transaction execution and order correctness hinder the border adoption of blockchain DApps. To address these issues, we propose L2chain, a novel blockchain framework aiming to scale the system through a layer-2 network where DApps process transactions in the layer-2 network and only the system state digest, acting as the state integrity proof, is maintained on-chain. To achieve high performance, we introduce the split-execute-merge (SEM) transaction processing workflow with the help of the RSA accumulator, allowing DApps to lock and update a part of the state digest in parallel. We also design a witness cache mechanism for DApp executors to reduce the transaction processing latency. To fulfill confidentiality, we leverage the trusted execution environment (TEE) for DApps to execute encrypted transactions off-chain. To ensure transaction execution and order correctness, we propose a two-step execution process for DApps to prevent attacks (i.e., rollback attacks) from subverting the state transition. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that L2chain can achieve 1.5X to 42.2X and 7.1X to 8.9X throughput improvements in permissioned and permissionless settings respectively.","","","Xu, ZH (Corresponding Author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

These systems are commonly used for the security purposes but are increasingly being used in a variety of other applications such as residential security, voter verification, banking using ATM. Changes in facial expression become a difficult task in recognizing faces. In this paper continuous naturalistic affective expressions will be recognized using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework. Active Appearance Model (AAM) landmarks are considered for each frame of the videos. The AAMs were used to track the face and extract its visual features. There are six different facial expressions considered over here: Happy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Fear and Sad. Different Expression recognition problem is solved through a multistage automatic pattern recognition system where the temporal relationships are modeled through the HMM framework. Dimension levels (Le., labels) can be defined as the hidden states sequences in the HMM framework. Then the probabilities of these hidden states and their state transitions can be accurately computed from the labels of the training set. Through a three stage classification approach, the output of a first-stage classification is used as observation sequences for a second stage classification, modeled as a HMM-based framework. The k-NN will be used for the first stage classification. A third classification stage, a decision fusion tool, is then used to boost overall performance.","Hidden Markov model (HMM); K Nearest Neighbor (k-NN); Active Appearance Model (AAM); Dimension levels","International Conference on Electronics and Communication Systems (ICECS), Coimbatore, INDIA, FEB 13-14, 2014","Vijayalakshmi, M (Corresponding Author), Kalasalingam Univ, Dept ECE, Krishnonkoil, Tamil Nadu, India.

WearRF-CLA explores the observation that human daily routines in a protected indoor area comprise a sequence of human-states (e.g., walking and sitting) that follow predictable state transitions. Each legitimate WearRF-CLA user registers his/her RFID tag and also wrist wearable during system enrollment. After the user enters a protected area, WearRF-CLA continuously collects and processes the gyroscope data of the wrist wearable and the phase data of the RFID tag signals to verify three factors to determine the user's physical presence/absence without explicit user involvement: (1) the tag ID as in a traditional RFID authentication system, (2) the validity of the human-state chain, and (3) the continuous coexistence of the paired wrist wearable and RFID tag with the user.

The gyrotron based on the principle of electron cyclotron maser is able to generate watt-to-megawatt level terahertz radiation, and becomes an exceptional role in the frontiers of energy, security and biomedicine. However, in normal conditions, a terahertz gyrotron could generate terahertz radiation with high efficiency on a single frequency or with low efficiency in a relatively narrow tuning band. Here a frequency tuning scheme for the terahertz gyrotron utilizing sequentially switching among several whispering-gallery modes is proposed to reach high performance with broadband, coherence and high power simultaneously. Such mode-switching gyrotron has the potential of generating broadband radiation with 100-GHz-level bandwidth. Even wider bandwidth is limited by the frequency-dependent effective electrical length of the cavity. Preliminary investigation applies a pre-bunched circuit to the single-mode wide-band tuning. Then, more broadband sweeping is produced by mode switching in great-range magnetic tuning. The effect of mode competition, as well as critical engineering techniques on frequency tuning is discussed to confirm the feasibility for the case close to reality. This multi-modeswitching scheme could make gyrotron a promising device towards bridging the so-called terahertz gap.","","","Du, CH; Liu, PK (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.

Various systems, like the Web PKI (X.509) and PGP's Web of Trust are used to manage trust in this setting. In recent years, blockchain technology has been introduced as a panacea to our security problems, including that of authentication, without sufficient reasoning, as to its merits. In this work, we investigate the merits of using open distributed ledgers (ODLs), such as the one implemented by blockchain technology, for securing TM systems for authentication. We formally model such systems, and explore how blockchain can help mitigate attacks against them. After formal argumentation, we conclude that in the context of Trust Management for authentication, blockchain technology, and ODLs in general, can offer considerable advantages compared to previous approaches. Our analysis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to formally model and argue about the security of TM systems for authentication, based on blockchain technology. To achieve this result, we first provide an abstract model for TM systems for authentication. Then, we show how this model can be conceptually encoded in a blockchain, by expressing it as a series of state transitions. As a next step, we examine five prevalent attacks on TM systems, and provide evidence that blockchain-based solutions can be beneficial to the security of such systems, by mitigating, or completely negating such attacks.","","16th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications / The 11th IEEE International Conference on Big Data Science and Engineering / The 14th IEEE International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems, Sydney, AUSTRALIA, AUG 01-04, 2017","Alexopoulos, N (Corresponding Author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Telecooperat Lab, Hochschulstr 10, D-64289 Darmstadt, Germany.

Given the mounting cyber-attack threats, these critical ICT systems create great security issues for smart grids. Additionally, the clever attackers have the ability to not only access and monitor the smart grid, but also hack it by launching well-established cyber-attacks. Thus, this article is devoted to understanding the potential stealthy cyber-attack and its countermeasure. First, this article proposes a stealthy sparse cyber-attack model in an ac smart grid by considering both the residual test-based detector and the interval-state-estimation-based detector, which is not considered in previous studies. The design model is formulated as a constrained optimization problem by minimizing the number of contaminated meters, where the characteristics of two types of detector are considered simultaneously as the constraints for the first time. A constrained differential evolution (CDE) is proposed as the solver because the optimization problem is NP-hard. Then, a generalized-cumulative-sum-based detector is developed to detect the proposed cyber-attacks, where a fractional-order state transition matrix is originally introduced into the estimator to describe the dynamics of the power system. Numerical studies illustrate the feasibility of CDE-based stealthy sparse cyber-attacks and the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasure.","Detectors; Smart grids; Optimization; State estimation; Phasor measurement units; Power system dynamics; Pollution measurement; Constrained differential evolution (CDE); false data injection attack (FDIA); generalized cumulative sum; smart grid security; stealthy sparse cyber-attack","","Wu, ZG (Corresponding Author), Zhejiang Univ, Inst Cyber Syst & Control, Natl Lab Ind Control Technol, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China.

First, the multiobjective performance indicators were introduced to transform the sites' energy dispatching problem into a multiobjective optimization problem. Second, the vitality factor was introduced into the PSO strategy to solve the local optimal problem, and in the PSO-ACO fusion strategy, the PSO routes were transformed into the ant colony enhancement pheromone to accelerate the accumulation speed of the ACO initial pheromone. Then, the angle guidance function was introduced into the state transition probability of the ACO strategy to improve the global search capability, and a high-quality pheromone update rule was proposed to improve the convergence speed of the algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments were carried out on the improved PSO-ACO algorithm, Min-Max Ant System (MMAS) algorithm, ACO algorithm, PSO algorithm, and PSO update algorithm in a variety of complex site scenarios.

This method can be applied to calculate probabilistic security indices as well as on-line security assessment. In general, the determination of security breach is a cumbersome and time-consuming process due to dynamic and steady-state effects. These effects can be incorporated by considering transient stability, satisfaction of system load without violation of constraints, and voltage stability studies. The variation of the system load, as well as contingencies, may cause system transition to a different operating state. It is impractical if not impossible to evaluate all these situations, such as contingencies resulting from load variation. The straightforward Monte Carlo simulation, one of the possible methods in power system reliability analysis, requires the evaluation of a system operating state for each sampled state and is computation-intensive. In the proposed method, first the joint probability density of feature vectors has been obtained by using some training data. Once this joint distribution is obtained, the Bayes classifier provides the assessment of system security without complicated contingency analyses and can reduce the computational burden. Security status of a given feature vector can be determined by a posteriori probability rule called Bayes rule, which can be implemented in on-line security assessment or power system reliability studies.

Existing software and hardware approaches for finding and identifying memory bugs have a number of drawbacks including considerable performance overheads, target only a specific type of bug, implementation cost, and inefficient use of computational resources. This article describes MemTracker, a new hardware support mechanism that can be configured to perform different kinds of memory access monitoring tasks. MemTracker associates each word of data in memory with a few bits of state, and uses a programmable state transition table to react to different events that can affect this state. The number of state bits per word, the events to which MemTracker reacts, and the transition table are all fully programmable. MemTracker's rich set of states, events, and transitions can be used to implement different monitoring and debugging checkers with minimal performance overheads, even when frequent state updates are needed. To evaluate MemTracker, we map three different checkers onto it, as well as a checker that combines all three. For the most demanding ( combined) checker with 8 bits state per memory word, we observe performance overheads of only around 3%, on average, and 14.5% worst-case across different benchmark suites. Such low overheads allow continuous (always-on) use of MemTracker-enabled checkers, even in production runs.","Design; Performance; Reliability; Accelerator; memory access monitoring; debugging","","Venkataramani, G (Corresponding Author), Georgia Inst Technol, Coll Comp, 266 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.

The ensemble DT classifier was trained offline using data from the operational model of the power system under different system loading and contingency conditions. The trained classifier provides online security assessment and classifies the power system's current operating state as secure or insecure based on real-time measurements of the key attributes by selective PMUs.

Case studies of the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) system and IEEE reliability test system (RTS) are described to demonstrate this approach.","","IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, BANGKOK, THAILAND, MAY 25-28, 2003","Kim, H (Corresponding Author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Elect Engn, College Stn, TX 77840 USA.

Sensor networks based on IoT have strong Information transmission and processing capabilities. The security of sensor networks is progressively crucial. Cryptographic algorithms are widely used in sensor networks to guarantee security. Hardware implementations are preferred, since software implementations offer lower throughout and require more computational resources. Cryptographic chips should be tested in a manufacturing process and in the field to ensure their quality. As a widely used design-for-testability (DFT) technique, scan design can enhance the testability of the chips by improving the controllability and observability of the internal flip-flops. However, it may become a backdoor to leaking sensitive information related to the cipher key, and thus, threaten the security of a cryptographic chip. In this paper, a secure scan test architecture was proposed to resist scan-based noninvasive attacks on cryptographic chips with boundary scan design. Firstly, the proposed DFT architecture provides the scan chain reset mechanism by gating a mode-switching detection signal into reset input of scan cells. The contents of scan chains will be erased when the working mode is switched between test mode and functional mode, and thus, it can deter mode-switching based noninvasive attacks. Secondly, loading the secret key into scan chains of cryptographic chips is prohibited in the test mode. As a result, the test-mode-only scan attack can also be thwarted. On the other hand, shift operation under functional mode is disabled to overcome scan attack in the functional mode. The proposed secure scheme ensures the security of cryptographic chips for sensor networks with extremely low area penalty.","sensors; Internet-of-Things; sensor networks; information security; cryptographic chips","","Wang, J (Corresponding Author), Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Changsha 410114, Hunan, Peoples R China.

Existing studies about the security of SDN-enabled smart grid (SDSG) mainly focused on static methods such as access control and identity authentication, which is vulnerable to attackers that carefully probe the system. As the attacks become more variable and complex, there is an urgent need for dynamic defense methods. In this paper, we propose a security function virtualization (SFV) based moving target defense of SDSG which makes the attack surface constantly changing. First, we design a dynamic defense mechanism by migrating virtual security function (VSF) instances as the traffic state changes. The centralized SDN controller is re-designed for global status monitoring and migration management. Moreover, we formalize the VSF instances migration problem as an integer nonlinear programming problem with multiple constraints and design a pre-migration algorithm to prevent VSF instances' resources from being exhausted.

Comprehensive detection of these Trojans during post-manufacturing test has been shown to be extremely difficult. Hence, it is important to develop design techniques that provide effective countermeasures against hardware Trojans by either preventing Trojan attacks or facilitating detection during test. Obfuscation is a technique that is conventionally employed to prevent piracy of software and hardware intellectual property (IP). In this work, we propose a novel application of key-based circuit structure and functionality obfuscation to achieve protection against hardware Trojans triggered by rare internal circuit conditions. The proposed obfuscation scheme is based on judicious modification of the state transition function, which creates two distinct functional modes: normal and obfuscated. A circuit transitions from the obfuscated to the normal mode only upon application of a specific input sequence, which defines the key. We show that it provides security against Trojan attacks in two ways: (1) it makes some inserted Trojans benign, i.e. they become effective only in the obfuscated mode; and (2) it prevents an adversary from exploiting the true rare events in a circuit to insert hard-to-detect Trojans. The proposed design methodology can thus achieve simultaneous protection from hardware Trojans and hardware IP piracy. Besides protecting ICs against Trojan attacks in foundry, we show that it can also protect against malicious modifications by untrusted computer-aided design (CAD) tools in both SoC and FPGA design flows. Simulation results for a set of benchmark circuits show that the scheme is capable of achieving high levels of security against Trojan attacks at modest area, power and delay overhead.","Design obfuscation; Hardware Trojan; IP protection; Logic testing; Trojan detection","","Chakraborty, RS (Corresponding Author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.

However, due to low-resource and poor computing capability, these devices have a high number of firmware vulnerabilities. Software verification is a powerful solution to ensure the correctness and security of IoT firmware programs. Unfortunately, due to the complex semantics and syntax of program languages (typically C), applying software verification in IoT firmware faces the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. One of the fundamental reasons is that verification methods cannot support verifying state transitions on the memory space caused by pointer operations well. To this end, by combining sparse value flow (SVF) analysis into model checking and optimizing computational redundancy among them, we design a novel points-to-sensitive model checker, called PCHECKER, which can provide a highly precise and efficient verification for IoT firmware programs. We first design a spatial flow model to effectively describe state behaviors of a C program both on the symbolic and memory space. We then propose a counterexample-guided model checking algorithm that can dynamically refine abstract precisions and update nondeterministic points-to relations. With a set of C benchmarks containing a variety of pointer operations and other complex C features, our experiments have shown that compared with state of the art (SOTA), PCHECKER can achieve outstanding results in the verification tasks of C programs that its verification accuracy is 95.9%, and its average verification time of each line of code is 1.27 ms, which are both better than existing model checkers.","Model checking; Computational modeling; Software; Internet of Things; Analytical models; Semantics; Security; Model checking; pointer analysis; spare value flow analysis; software verification","","Liu, JJ (Corresponding Author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Natl Engn Lab Integrated AeroSp Ground Ocean Big, Sch Cybersecur, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

We correspondingly analyze the dynamics of the new 5G RRC three-states model for a machine-type traffic pattern under an attack-free situation. Afterwards, we introduce and describe two RRC-based denial of service (DoS) attacks threatening the 5G-RAN resources availability. In the first threat scenario, the attacker maliciously manipulates the timing of state transitions in an attempt to overload the control plane. The second attack can be carried out through faking huge on-demand system information requests to prevent legitimate consumers from access to the cell and cause failed and interrupted 5G mobile services. Through numerical simulations, we measure the potential impact of these attacks on both 5G devices using the collision probability along with the access delay metrics, and on the critical gNB-centralized unit using the signaling overhead and the resource occupancy time metrics. Our observations reveal that both attacks can have disastrous effects on network stability and resiliency.

Current IDS approaches can be classified as either anomaly or signature-based methods such as Rule-based expert systems, State transition analysis, Bayesian alarm networks aspects are various challenges with respect to the efficiency as well as performance.

The network configuration information and vulnerability scan results of an enterprise network are used to construct a network security state space, where a network security state changes as a result of actions taken by the attacker/administrator. Using the modeled stochastic game, a quantitative decision making framework has been proposed for enterprise network administrators to identify his optimal actions in case of network intrusion. Experimentations show that proposed model scales well with networks consisting of number of hosts in order of hundreds.","Stochastic Game; Network Service Vulnerability; Network Intrusion; Attack Graph; Intrusion Response System; Nash Equilibrium","10th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Internet Technology (ICDCIT), Kalinga Inst Informat Technol Univ, Bhubaneswar, INDIA, FEB 06-09, 2014","Kundu, A (Corresponding Author), Indian Inst Technol, Sch Informat Technol, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.

Generally it is used in households as an over current circuit breaker to ensure safety from electrical hazards like outrageous fire accidents arising from electrical short circuit. These kinds of electrical hazards occur because the amperage of these circuit breakers are fixed and we cannot change the tripping current anytime to endure the newly added or removed electrical loads. This paper reports the experimental realization of a numerical overcurrent relay using, primarily, a microcontroller and a micro current transformer (CT) which is compatible with smart grid technology and high voltage system like electric vehicle. In this newly designed numerical over current relay (NOCR) the user can change the set current and the sensitivity of the system just by twisting two different knobs. Thus this system ensures advance security against electrical hazards than a normal MCB. It will obtain, trial and covert analog current signals hooked on digital form of a power system in real time. Solid state switch (MOSFET switch) has been opted as circuit breaker in order to enhance system effectivity. This newly designed system can detect a fault or over current with 100% accuracy and the operating time (OT) calculated by this relay is 99.57% responsive to the theoretical calculation. All the components used to assemble this system are off the shelf; hence engender an economic and portable over current relay than any other commercially available system.","Miniature circuit breaker; numerical over current relay; current transformer; microcontroller; MOSFET","International Conference on Smart Grids and Energy Systems (SGES), ELECTR NETWORK, NOV 23-26, 2020","Mostafa, MM (Corresponding Author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.

By introducing the maximum entropy (MaxENT) models into the rule optimization for the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model, this paper proposes an improved BLP model with the self-learning function: MaxENT-BLP. This model first formalizes the security properties, system states, transformational rules, and a constraint model based on the states transition of the MaxENT. After handling the historical system access logs as the original data sets, this model extracts the user requests, current states, and decisions to act as the feature vectors. Second, we use k-fold cross validation to divide all vectors into a training set and a testing set. In this paper, the model training process is based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. And this model contains a strategy update algorithm to adjust the access control rules dynamically according to the access and decision records in a system. Third, we prove that MaxENT-BLP is secure through theoretical analysis. By estimating the precision, recall, and F1-score, the experiments show the availability and accuracy of this model. Finally, this paper provides the process of model training based on deep learning and discussions regarding adversarial samples from the malware classifiers. We demonstrate that MaxENT-BLP is an appropriate choice and has the ability to help running information systems to avoid more risks and losses.","Adversarial sample; BLP; machine learning; mandatory access control; maximum entropy model; rule optimization","","Tang, Z (Corresponding Author), Hunan Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.

In this paper, we model the CPS subject to cyber-attacks as a class of hybrid systems called hidden mode switched linear systems so that it can account for both the switching attack that tampers the discrete state dynamics (logical behavior) and the bounded data injection attack which compromises the continuous state dynamics (physical behavior) of the CPS. A resilient hybrid control scheme is proposed to mitigate the impact of these cyber-attacks. It is shown that the proposed resilient hybrid control scheme is able to estimate the switching attack signal and guarantee the attack mitigation under the assumptions that the discrete states of the hybrid system are distinguishable and the switching attack signal satisfies the average dwell-time condition.","","58th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC), Nice, FRANCE, DEC 11-13, 2019","Sun, DW (Corresponding Author), Purdue Univ, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.

User position is also considered when various access points changed states. Moreover, the algorithm also verifies the legitimacy of a fire alarm by measuring the change in temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide levels, thus defending against manipulative attackers. The experiment conducted in this paper used a combination of sensors, microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi and ZigBee communication to identify user behavior at various access points and implement the logical sensing algorithm.

With the increase in modern malicious technologies, confidential data are exposed at a greater risk during data communication. For secured communication, recent technologies and the Internet have introduced steganography, a new way to hide data. Steganography is the growing practice of concealing data in multimedia files for secure data transfer. Nowadays, videos are more commonly chosen as cover media than other multimedia files because of the moving sequence of images and audio files. Despite its popularity, video steganography faces a significant challenge, which is a lack of a fast retrieval system of the hidden data. This study proposes a novel video steganography technique in which an enhanced hidden Markov model (EHMM) is employed to improve the speed of retrieving hidden data. EHMM mathematical formulations are used to enhance the speed of embedding and extracting secret data. The data embedding and retrieving operations were performed using the conditional states and the state transition dynamics between the video frames. The proposed EHMM is extensively evaluated using three benchmark functions, and experimental evaluations are conducted to test the speed of data retrieval using differently sized cover-videos. Results indicate that the proposed EHMM yields better results by reducing the data hiding time by 3-50%, improving the data retrieval rate by 22-77% with a minimum computational cost of 20-91%, and improving the security by 4-77% compared with state-of-the-art methods.

The rich history of the development of countermeasures for specific MSCA, e.g., DDoS, worms, has shown that it is the special spatio-temporal characteristic that causes the prevention, detection and response of MSCA to be challenging. Instead of focusing on fine-grained specific attack analysis, this paper presents a model from high-level viewpoint, aiming at characterizing the behaviors of MSCA in terms of key spatio-temporal properties for better understanding and more effective design of countermeasures. The model is specifically developed for two purposes: First, it sheds light on the fundamental elements of an MSCA by examining its spatio-temporal related observations, and formulating attacker behavior as a reward-directed Markov decision process; Second, it assists security administrator in identifying the potential causal relationship of system vulnerabilities based on the reports of deployed security tools, so as to suggest appropriate actions. Taking the model as a basis, two meta-heuristic algorithms are designed. Specifically, attackers nondeterministic trail search (ANTS) is developed for approximately searching attack schemes with the minimum attack cost, and attacker's pivots discovery via backward searching (APD-BS) is designed for examining the pivots of attack schemes, namely the key observations associated with system state transitions during an attack. Finally, a proof-of-concept validation is conducted using a simulated enterprise network under DDoS attack, which is a typical MSCA variant. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A very feasible biometric approach to verify the authenticity of a user is to examine his/her typing patterns. There is a significant difference in the keystroke patterns exhibited from person to person, even when asked to type the same words. Typing patterns can be shown in the intervals between keys, holding time, overlap keys, etc. Individual's typing pattern develops naturally and uniquely just as each person writes differently. We propose an analytical process based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) to learn the special patterns from individuals, and then to identify them. During training, the timing information of each keystroke is recorded at its holding and releasing events, and the pattern is then extracted from the relationship of the events within a word. The experiment to be conducted is to authenticate users when entering words. The idea is to implement a process to examine the typing pattern as a user enters higher password, in order to augment the conventional password system. We find the discrete first-order HMM to be very suitable for our purpose. Due to the non-deterministic nature of the keystroke events, modeling with a stochastic process such as the HMM which has probabilistic state transitions can not only recognize the patterns in the keys already typed, but also predict the following sequence. The issue is similar to the recognition of hand-written characters or spoken words. The experimental results are nearly perfect among twenty test subjects all randomly chosen in a controlled environment of a standard computer laboratory.","","IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration, Las Vegas, NV, NOV 08-10, 2004","","English",""

In this paper we present algorithms and automation tools for constructing discrete event controllers for complex networked systems that restrict the dynamic behavior of the system according to given specifications. In our previous work we have modeled dynamic system as a discrete event automaton whose open loop behavior is represented as a language L of strings generated with the alphabet Sigma of all possible atomic events that cause state transitions in the network. The controlled behavior is represented by a sublanguage K, contained in L, that restricts the behavior of the system according to the specifications of the controller. We have developed the algebraic structure of controllable sublanguages as perfect right partial ideals that satisfy a precontrollability condition.(1) In this paper we develop an iterative algorithm to take an ad hoc specification described using a natural language, and to formulate a complete specification that results in a controllable sublanguage. A supervisory controller modeled as an automaton that runs synchronously with the open loop system in the sense of Ramadge and Wonham(2) is automatically generated to restrict the behavior of the open loop system to the controllable sublanguage. A battlefield surveillance scenario illustrates the iterative evolution of ad hoc specifications for controlling an autonomous sensor network and the generation of a controller that reconfigures the sensor network to dynamically adapt to environmental perturbations.","Sensor Networks; Discrete event control; controllable language; complete specifications; dynamic network adaptation.","Conference on Advanced Signal Processing Algorithms Architectures and Implementations XIII, SAN DIEGO, CA, AUG 06-08, 2003","Penn State Univ, Appl Res Lab, State Coll, PA 16801 USA.","English","PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)"

The method works based on the signal's nonlinear characteristics which result from the unintentional and unavoidable physical-layer imperfections. The reconstructed phase space (RPS) is used as the tool for analyzing the nonlinearity. The entire characteristics of RPS and state changes characteristics of points in RPS are extracted to form RFF. To evaluate the availability of the RFF, the signals from four wireless network cards are collected by a signal acquisition system.

A normally operating high-voltage transmission network could approximately satisfy the linearization conditions so the ISFs remain constant. The existing ISFs calculation method is the DC approximations based on the branch reactance matrix. But this method has inherent drawbacks resulting in its inaccuracy in two aspects: (1) the parameters of power system elements are hard to acquire accurately because of parameter offset as operation states change; (2) we need to set a reference node to balance the power flow, but the setting is often inconsistent with the real balance strategy. In the above context, we propose a measurement-based estimation method which uses robust least-squares estimation and SCADA measurement data to calculate the ISFs. The effectiveness of the method is verified by comparing the ISFs got from the measurement-based robust estimation with the ones got from DC approximations and the ordinary least-squares estimation (LSE).","Injection shift factors; Least-squares estimation; Robust least-squares estimation; SCADA measurement data","International Conference on Power System Technology (PowerCon), Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA, OCT 20-22, 2014","Zhang, BL (Corresponding Author), Elect Power Res Inst Shandong, Jinan 250002, Peoples R China.

In particular, we propose decoupling the operating system kernel from user processes by running each on completely separate processor cores instead of at different privilege levels within shared cores. Without using the hardware's privilege modes, virtualization and virtual memory contexts enforce the security policies necessary to maintain process isolation and protection. Our new kernel design paradigm offers the opportunity to simultaneously increase both performance and security; utilizing the hardware facilities for inter-core communication in place of those for privilege mode switching offers the opportunity for increased system call performance, while the hard separation between user processes and the kernel provides several strong security properties.","","25th New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW), Granby, CO, SEP 26-29, 2016","Brookes, S (Corresponding Author), Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, 14 Engn Dr, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.

However, highly redundant storage and complex consensus prevent the blockchain from being directly deployed to edge computing nodes with limited resources. Unlike existing lightweight schemes, which do not consider liberating transaction data from blocks, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchain ledger protocol for MEC networks. The novelty of this work is that the transaction data in the block is compressed into a succinct proof through the zero-knowledge proof algorithm. To reduce the storage of block data, this paper proposes the proof-of-state-transfer model in which nodes verify the correctness of the global state transfer in the block without transactions.

To perform very fast regex matching, deterministic finite automata (DFA) has been the first choice because its time complexity is constant O(1). Unfortunately, DFA often suffers the well known state explosion problem and, consequently, tends to require prohibitive memory overhead in practical applications. To address the problem, a wide variety of DFA compression techniques have been proposed; however, few can keep up with the ever increasing network traffic bandwidth and regex set complexity. This paper proposes that the DFA problem is rooted in regexes (rather than in DFA), i.e., semantic overlapping of regexes, and accordingly presents a complete algorithmic solution PaCC (Partition, Compression, and Combination), that can transform the given large-scale set of complex regexes into a compact and fast matching engine using DFA as its core. PaCC fundamentally defuses state explosion for DFA by partitioning complex regexes into overlapping-free segments. By exploiting the massive repetitiveness among the resulting segments, PaCC can further deflate corresponding DFA in terms of the number of states. Moreover, on the basis of the characteristics of these segments, PaCC takes a tailor-made compression approach and reduces over 96% of the state transitions for the corresponding DFA.

In this paper, an approach of dynamic Bayesian network with transfer probability estimation was developed to predict whether the goal of system call sequences is normal or not, with early-warnings being launched, so as to ensure that some appropriate countermeasures could be taken in advance. Since complete set of system call state transfer can hardly be built in real environments, the empirical results show that the newly emerging system call transfer would have great impact on the prediction performance if we straightly use dynamic Bayesian network without transfer probability estimation. Therefore, we estimate the probability of new state transfer to predict the goals of system call sequences together with those in conditional probability table (CPT).

Highly dynamic and possibly unpredictable environments, and uncertain operating conditions call for new paradigms of software design, and run-time adaptation mechanisms, to overcome the lack of knowledge at design time. Main application areas include vehicles or robots that need to collaborate to achieve a common task, e.g., minimize fuel consumption, moving objects at a construction site, or performing a set of operations in a factory. Moreover, these vehicles or robots need to interact and possibly collaborate with humans in a safe way, e.g., avoiding accidents or collisions, and prevent hazardous situations that may harm humans and/or machines.

Results from test case study have been analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Case study results indicate that the proposed method can detect islanding events with high accuracy and reliability.","Distributed generation; decision tree; islanding detection; microgrids","2015 IEEE Power & Energy Society Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT), Washington, DC, FEB 18-20, 2015","Azim, R (Corresponding Author), Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.

Attack class has many subclasses like Actor class which is entity executing the attack, Goal class describes goal of the attack, Attack mechanism class defines attack methodology, Scope class describes size and utility of the target, Automation level describes the automation level of the attack Evaluation of security status of the network is required for network security situational awareness.

The Blockchain is a widely utilized decentralization technology that is implemented in various industries. Therefore, this technology can be used to protect sensitive services, such as those associated with the configuration changing of information systems. This article proposes a new protocol operating as a decentralization layer over any configuration scheme. It uses smart contracts-programs existing on the Blockchain-to keep track of configuration proposals and authorize new configurations. The configuration change can be proposed at any time. However, only once it is authorized by appropriate parties can it be introduced to the system. The new protocol provides an additional security layer, ensuring that every action is accounted for and authenticated. Furthermore, it enforces that administrators authorize every change. The protocol was designed to be flexible and easily adaptable to scenarios that did not use distributed ledger technology before. It uses the HTTP protocol with the JSON standard for protocol messages to allow easier adoption and transparency. The features of the proposed protocol were analyzed from a security point of view as well as from the financial perspective related to costs of using Blockchain technology. Security analysis shows that the protocol is resilient to the most common security risks that haunt state-of-the-art IT systems. Additionally, the authors proved that this solution could be implemented in both private and public Blockchains. A reference implementation was shared in a public repository.

This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for dynamic small-signal stability assessment of power grids by estimating the region of attraction (ROA) for operating states in real time. By analyzing the latest sampling data of power grids in a fixed time window, an up-to-date training set is constructed with the aid of converse Lyapunov function, which enables us to develop an online learning approach based on Gaussian Process (GP) to assess the stability level of power grids. As a result, an iteration algorithm is designed to update the assessment parameters by learning the input-output pairs in the training set. Theoretical analysis is conducted to ensure the existence of converse Lyapunov function for differential-algebraic system that serves to describe power system dynamics, as well as to estimate the region of attraction for operating states with a given confidence level. In particular, a practical method is proposed to leverage time series of phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements including voltage/current magnitude, phase and frequency (i.e., PMU data) of real power grids for validating the online GP approach. Moreover, validations are taken to substantiate the proposed approach by using PMU data of real smart-grid infrastructure and IEEE test cases. The proposed assessment approach contributes to situational awareness of human operators in the control station, thereby taking proactive remedial actions prior to emergencies.","Power system stability; Power system dynamics; Power grids; Security; Lyapunov methods; Stability criteria; Mathematical models; Online Gaussian process; region of attraction; power systems stability; security assessment","","Zhai, C (Corresponding Author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Automat, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.

Enterprise access-control systems have grown to protect tens of thousands of resources, and there is a need for verification to scale commensurately. We present techniques for abstraction-refinement and bound-estimation for bounded model checkers to automatically find errors in Administrative Role-Based Access Control (ARBAC) security policies. ARBAC is the first and most comprehensive administrative scheme for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) systems. In the abstraction-refinement portion of our approach, we identify and discard roles that are unlikely to be relevant to the verification question (the abstraction step). We then restore such abstracted roles incrementally (the refinement steps). In the bound-estimation portion of our approach, we lower the estimate of the diameter of the reachability graph from the worst-case by recognizing relationships between roles and state-change rules. Our techniques complement one another, and are used with conventional bounded model checking. Our approach is sound and complete: an error is found if and only if it exists. We have implemented our technique in an access-control policy analysis tool called MOHAWK. We show empirically that MOHAWK scales well to realistic policies, and provide a comparison with prior tools.","Algorithms; Security; Verification","","Jayaraman, K (Corresponding Author), Microsoft Corp, Windows Azure, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.

In this paper, we have extended the model to allow grantors of delegations to express degrees of certainties about their delegations and grants of authorizations. This expression of certainty gives the subjects (e.g. users) more flexibility to control their delegations of access rights. We propose a new conflict resolution policy based on weighted lengths of authorization paths. This policy provides a greater degree of flexibility in that it enables to specify and analyse the effect of predecessor-successor relationship as well as the weights of authorizations on the conflicts. We present a detailed algorithm to evaluate authorization delegations and conflict resolutions. The correctness proof and time complexity of the algorithm are also provided. Since in a dynamic environment, the authorization state is not static, we have considered how authorization state changes occur and have developed an algorithm to analyse authorization state transformations and given correctness proofs. Finally, we discuss how to achieve a global decision policy from local authorization policies in a distributed environment. Three integration models based on the degrees of node autonomy are proposed, and different strategies of integrating the local policies into the global policies in each model are systematically discussed.","Access control; Authorization delegation; Conflict resolution; Weighted graph","","Ruan, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Western Sydney, Sch Comp & Math, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia.

However, integration of intelligence and cyber systems into a power grid can lead to serious cyber security challenges and makes the overall system more vulnerable to cyber attacks. To address this challenging issue, this article presents defense mechanisms to either protect the system from attackers in advance or detect the existence of data injection attacks to improve the smart grid security. Focusing on signal processing techniques, this article introduces an adaptive scheme on detection of injected bad data at the control center. This scheme takes the power measurements of two sequential data collection slots into account, and detects data injection attacks by monitoring the measurement variations and state changes between the two time slots. The proposed scheme has the capability of adaptively detecting attacks including both non-stealthy attacks and stealthy attacks. Stealthy attacks are proved impossible to detect using conventional residual-based methods, and can cause more dangerous effects on power systems than non-stealthy attacks. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme can also be used for attack classification to help system operators prioritize their actions to better protect their systems, and is therefore very valuable in practical smart grid systems.","","","Jiang, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Durham, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Durham, England.

At the planning stage, the defender can utilize software diversity, which is a common phenomenon that the cyber software of different substations comes from different competing vendors. Therefore, different kinds of software may not be exposed to the same zero-day security loophole, preventing the attacker from taking charge of multiple substations at the same time. In this paper, the optimal scheme of software deployment considering long-term risk mitigation is studied. Firstly, the framework of diversity-based cyber defense against malicious attacks is formulated. Secondly, the risk index based on representative attack patterns is constructed, which is the objective to be minimized. Thirdly, considering that the deployment scheme is long-term stable while the operating mode varies with time, we construct a multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming to mitigate the average risk of operating modes. Then the optimization problem is solved by the multiobjective genetic algorithm. Lastly, results of the IEEE 39-node CPPS and and the Virtual European Grid demonstrate that the proposed method can considerably reduce the attack risk.","Substations; Cyberattack; Software; Power systems; Indexes; Security; Risk management; Cyber-physical power system; multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA); nonlinear integer programming; risk mitigation; stochastic programming; software diversity","","Huang, SW; Mei, SW (Corresponding Author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

Its quality has a high influence on the duration of the analysis required to locate software faults. Nevertheless, execution tracing quality has not been described by a quality model, which is an impediment while measuring software product quality. In addition, such a model needs to consider uncertainty, as the underlying factors involve human analysis and assessment. The goal of this study is to address both issues and to fill the gap by defining a quality model for execution tracing. The data collection was conducted on a defined study population with the inclusion of software professionals to consider their accumulated experiences; moreover, the data were processed by genetic algorithms to identify the linguistic rules of a fuzzy inference system. The linguistic rules constitute a human-interpretable rule set that offers further insights into the problem domain. The study found that the quality properties accuracy, design and implementation have the strongest impact on the quality of execution tracing, while the property legibility is necessary but not completely inevitable. Furthermore, the quality property security shows adverse effects on the quality of execution tracing, but its presence is required to some extent to avoid leaking information and to satisfy legal expectations. The created model is able to describe execution tracing quality appropriately. In future work, the researchers plan to link the constructed quality model to overall software product quality frameworks to consider execution tracing quality with regard to software product quality as a whole. In addition, the simplification of the mathematically complex model is also planned to ensure an easy-to-tailor approach to specific application domains.","software product quality model; quality assessment; execution tracing; logging; execution tracing quality; logging quality; fuzzy logic; artificial intelligence","","Galli, T; Chiclana, F (Corresponding Author), De Montfort Univ, Inst Artificial Intelligence IAI, Fac Comp Engn & Media, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England.

To understand the state of land eco-security, the Environment-Economic-Society model was applied to build a land eco-security evaluation index system in the Shule River Basin. An entropy-weighted and matter-element model was built for eco-security evaluation from 2005 to 2014. Principal component analysis was used to quantitatively study the limiting factors of land ecological security. The result showed: the direction of development of the state of land eco-security in the Shule River Basin from 2005 to 2014 was characterized by ``unsafe (No-4) -> safe (No-1),'' and presented an upward trend. The land eco-security status during 2005-2007 was in the ``Unsafe'' state and the state changed to ``Critical Safe'' in 2008-2009, ``Safer'' in 2010-2011, but ``Safe'' in 2012-2014. The key factors that affected land eco-security in the Shule River Basin were Per Capita Arable Land, Forest Cover Rate, Per Capita Water Resources, Water Production Modulus, the Tertiary Industry Output Value, and GDP Ratio and Water Consumption. Among them, Forest Cover Rate and Water Production Modulus had the greatest impact, with principal component loads of up to 0.973 and 0.968, respectively.

TBAS is based on the simple idea of comparing the channel states embedded in packets received within a short interval and discarding the packets if the channel state change is above a reasonable level for the interval. We leverage the packet transmission policies in Wi-Fi to actively elicit packets for the channel state check without modifying the Wi-Fi protocol, such as sending a dummy data packet which will automatically elicit an acknowledgement packet. Comparing to the existing methods that wait passively for the packets from the packet sender for the channel state information, TBAS has the full control of time to collect the channel state, such that it can use stricter rules to classify the packets and achieve higher security. We solve key problems in TBAS, including a Channel State Check (CSC) procedure which determines if two packets are from the same sender, as well as a simple protocol wrapped around CSC to reduce the overhead. We implement TBAS on the Sora software defined ratio and our trace-driven emulations show that TBAS can achieve desirable False Positive and False Negative ratios with very low overhead.","","13th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking (SECON), London, ENGLAND, JUN 27-30, 2016","Liu, MY (Corresponding Author), Florida State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.

Security services include such things as a firewall, packet and flow classification, connection-state handling (i.e., stateful inspection), higher-layer protocol data unit (PDU) reassembly (i.e., application-level firewalls), and packet encryption and decryption. The PRO3, which is integrated with a high-speed line card, attempts to accelerate the performance of the firewall by implementing key functionality in hardware and by optimizing the balance between hardware and software functions. In this way, significant performance enhancements can be achieved, such as making transport control protocol (TCP) and Internet protocol (IP) data transactions secure, and protecting and separating virtual private networks (VPNs) from the external public network. The PRO3 incorporates an innovative scheme-a reduced instruction set computing (RISC)-based pipelined module with line-rate throughput-that makes it possible to process high- and low-level streaming operations efficiently. Using microcode profiling and simulation, we give performance results for a stateful-inspection firewall application with network address translation (NAT) support.

In this paper, we propose and implement a REST API security module for SDN controller based on OAuth 2.0. We answer the SDN REST API security challenges by presenting novel access control parameters to cope with the granular resources introduced by SDN.

This paper aims at establishing an step-by-step algorithm to study impacts of error in measurements on system security indices. Two different security indices representing under voltage severity and over load severity are studied in this paper. The proposed algorithm has three major steps. In the first step, typical measurements are sampled according to the system operating state and randomly generated errors. This is done using Monte Carlo sampling approach. The second step is to extract an approximate model of the system true state which is done via state estimators. Then, security indices are calculated for both the approximated and true states in the third step. Comparison between the indices demonstrates impacts of the erroneous measurements on security assessment.","Erroneous measurement; Monte Carlo simulation; security analysis; state estimation","23rd Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering, Sharif Univ of Technol, Tehran, IRAN, MAY 10-14, 2015","Farajollahi, M (Corresponding Author), Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Ctr Excellence Power Syst Control & Management, Tehran, Iran.

The entropy is used to describe the macro state of a self-organization system in physics. The entropy change indicates the system macro state change. This paper provides a method to construct crowd behavior microstates and the corresponded probability distribution using the individuals' velocity information (magnitude and direction). Then an entropy model was built up to describe the crowd behavior macro state. Simulation experiments and video detection experiments were conducted. It was verified that in the disordered state, the crowd behavior entropy is close to the theoretical maximum entropy; while in ordered state, the entropy is much lower than half of the theoretical maximum entropy. The crowd behavior macro state sudden change leads to the entropy change. The proposed entropy model is more applicable than the order parameter model in crowd behavior detection. By recognizing the entropy mutation, it is possible to detect the crowd behavior macro state automatically by utilizing cameras.

A repetitive load flow analysis demands huge computational efforts like efficient system modelling for faster load flow solutions, parallel programming and High performance computing (HPC). In this paper, an N-1-1 CA has been analysed using fast decoupled load flow (FDLF) with a strategy of screening and ranking the catastrophic contingencies.

To the best of our knowledge, OpenSGX is currently the only publicly available SGX emulation platform; however, its system-level support is largely limited owing to its user-mode emulation. In particular, experiments that require system functionalities or device emulation cannot be conducted with the current OpenSGX. To solve this problem, we propose System-OpenSGX (S-OpenSGX), which leverages QEMU's system emulation to provide researchers with full system-level support for exploring SGX enclave-based programming. In this paper, we show the design of S-OpenSGX, including system functionalities such as scheduling, multithreading, page table handling, and SGX paging. Non-trivial issues derived from the difference between user-mode and system emulation, and our approaches to addressing them are also described. Lastly, we utilize S-OpenSGX to experiment with a new mitigation method against the data leaking attack on enclave threads and an APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller) device modification to reduce SGX's mode switch overhead.

However, security policies are often carefully tightened during system design-time, and the large number of service dependencies in a system architecture makes their dynamic adaptation difficult. The enforcement of a single response rule requires performing multiple configuration changes on multiple services. This paper formally describes a Service Dependency Framework (SDF) in order to assist the response process in selecting the policy enforcement points (PEPs) capable of applying a dynamic response rule. It automatically derives elementary access rules from the generic access control, either allowed or denied by the dynamic response policy, so they can be locally managed by local PEPs. SDF introduces a requires/provides model of service dependencies. It models the service architecture in a modular way, and thus provides both extensibility and reusability of model components. SDF is defined using the Architecture Analysis and Design Language, which provides formal concepts for modeling system architect tires. This paper presents a systematic treatment of the dependency model which aims to apply policy rules while minimizing configuration changes and reducing resource consumption.","","6th International Conference on Detection of Intrusion and Malware, and Vulnerability Assessment, Como, ITALY, JUL 09-10, 2009","Kheir, N (Corresponding Author), France Telecom, R&D Caen, 42 Rue Coutures BP 6243, F-14066 Caen, France.

To ensure the system stability and minimize potential economic losses, it is imperative to monitor operating states and detect attacks at the early stage. To meet this demand, Micro-Phasor Measurement Units (mu PMU) are increasingly popular in monitoring distribution networks. However, due to the relatively low sampling rate, mu PMU has not yet been used to detect and classify cyber-attacks in power electronics enabled smart grid. To our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to use mu PMU to detect cyber attacks that degrade the performance of power electronics systems. We propose to apply data-driven methods on micro-PMU data to implement attack detection. We have evaluated data-driven methods, including decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN).

With the help of the two receiver coils and proper parameters design, the proposed system can naturally obtain constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) outputs and the maximum output power can be naturally limited which can prevent the system from possible overload. Therefore, the reliability of the proposed system is increased. Since the mode switching process can be automatically realised according to the value of battery equivalent load without extra control strategy and circuit, the fixed-frequency control can be used. Therefore, not only zero phase angle condition, but also the soft switching can be achieved. The theoretical analysis is presented with the design process of the IPT coils and resonance parameters for required battery charging profile. The performance of the system is verified by a 3.3 kW experimental prototype.

This arrangement of measures was able to restore the grid to a secure operating state, even with the five lines still out of service. By adopting an approach similar to underfrequency protection, measures, including load shedding, could be adopted to counter disturbances mom severe than those considered by planning criteria.

Therefore simulate the cascading process of power system is more meaningful than a single device contingency analysis. Against such backgrounds, this paper proposes a method for cascading failure simulation with static security analysis method, which considers the load variation during the fault. The method is divided into two steps: firstly, a self-adapting step is figured out with the climbing rate of the daily load curve, and secondly, the power flow at the self-adapting step, which is used to judge if another fault or even the cascading event has happened is calculated. In this way, the process of cascading failure can be simulated and monitored, which is beneficial for the operators to obtain the operating state of the power system in time and adopt appropriate measures to prevent the system from deteriorating into a large-scale blackout accidents. Finally, the standard IEEE 30-bus testing system is adopted to verify the correctness of the method.","cascading failure; power flow; static security analysis","Asia-Pacific Power and Energy Engineering Conference (APPEEC), Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA, MAR 28-31, 2009","Lian, W (Corresponding Author), N China Elect Power Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.

If DGs in those networks could continuously run instead of immediately being shut down, the blackout could be avoided and the reliability of supply could be increased.

In real time the knowledge base is used to perform a single contingency analysis around the working point for which the base case has been calculated. The same knowledge base is also used to carry out a double contingency analysis at the working point for which it has been established.

In this paper, we report that on the Android system (and likely other OSes), a weaker form of GUI confidentiality can be breached in the form of UI state (not the pixels) by a background app without requiring any permissions. Our finding leads to a class of attacks which we nameUI state inference attack. The underlying problem is that popular GUI frameworks by design can potentially reveal every UI state change through a newly-discovered public side channel - shared memory. In our evaluation, we show that for 6 out of 7 popular Android apps, the UI state inference accuracies are 80-90% for the first candidate UI states, and over 93% for the top 3 candidates. Even though the UI state does not reveal the exact pixels, we show that it can serve as a powerful building block to enable more serious attacks. To demonstrate this, we design and fully implement several new attacks based on the UI state inference attack, including hijacking the UI state to steal sensitive user input (e.g., login credentials) and obtain sensitive camera images shot by the user (e.g., personal check photos for banking apps). We also discuss non-trivial challenges in eliminating the identified side channel, and suggest more secure alternative system designs.","","23rd USENIX Security Symposium, San Diego, CA, AUG 20-22, 2014","Chen, QA (Corresponding Author), Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.

In a policy-based management approach, administrators define user privileges as rules that determine the conditions and the extent of users' access rights. As rules become more complex, analytical skills are required to identify conflicts and interactions within the rules that comprise a system policy-especially when rules are stateful and depend on event histories. Without adequate tool support such an analysis is error-prone and expensive. In consequence, many policy specifications are inconsistent or conflicting that render the system insecure. The security of the system, however, does not only depend on the correct specification of the security policy, but in a large part also on the correct interpretation of those rules by the system's enforcement mechanism. In this paper, we show how policy rules can be formalized in Fusion Logic, a temporal logic for the specification of behavior of systems. A symbolic decision procedure for Fusion Logic based on Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) is provided and we introduce a novel technique for the construction of enforcement mechanisms of access control policy rules that uses a BDD encoded enforcement automaton based on input traces which reflect state changes in the system. We provide examples of verification of policy rules, such as absence of conflicts, and dynamic separation of duty and of the enforcement of policies using our prototype implementation (FLCheck) for which we detail the underlying theory.","Access control policy; Policy enforcement; Policy verification; Binary decision diagram","","Cau, A (Corresponding Author), De Montfort Univ, Software Technol Res Lab, Leicester LE1 9BH, Leics, England.

However, current methods for detecting attacks are not sufficiently accurate and no methods can provide attack mitigation. To ensure vehicle ABS security, we propose an attack detection method to accurately detect both sensor attack and CAN bus attack in a vehicle ABS, and an attack mitigation strategy to mitigate their negative effects on the vehicle ABS. In our attack detection method, we build a vehicle state space equation which considers-time road friction coefficient to predict vehicle states (i.e., wheel speed and longitudinal brake force) with their previous values. Based on sets of historical measured vehicle states, we develop a search algorithm to find out attack changes (vehicle state changes because of the attack) by minimizing errors between predicted vehicle states and measured vehicle states. In our attack mitigation strategy, attack changes are subtracted from measured vehicle states to generate correct vehicle states for the vehicle ABS. We conducted first real sensor attack experiments to show how a magnet affects sensor readings. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack detection method can detect sensor attack and CAN bus attack more accurately compared with existing methods, and also our attack mitigation strategy ost eliminates attack's effects on the vehicle ABS.","CAN bus attack; Sensor attack; Attack detection and mitigation; Vehicle ABS","29th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN), ELECTR NETWORK, AUG 03-06, 2020","Kang, LW (Corresponding Author), Univ Virginia, Dept Comp Sci, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.

The aim is to detect attacks composed of a set of ``SCADA'' commands that, while licit when considered in isolation on a single-packet basis, can disrupt the correct behavior of the system when executed in particular operating states. The proposed firewall detects these complex attacks thanks to an internal representation of the controlled SCADA system.

These machines now affect the safety of humans as well as the security of personal data and consequently money transactions. To ensure the integrity of these systems' operating state, several fault detection mechanisms have been developed to safely correct or stop unforeseen execution behavior. Because of the rise of battery or even field-supplied systems these mechanisms often heavily decrease available power budgets or lead to significantly increased production costs. Therefore, this paper introduces novel micro-architectural execution signature characterization and handling techniques for system-on-chip designs providing power estimation hardware. Existing power sensor infrastructure is reused to enable efficient system-state monitoring using micro-architectural hashes to cover a wide range of implemented system functionality. Reduced hashing implementations are characterized for their fault detection efficiency. This hardware-based approach provides a completely transparent solution to counteract faults resulting from emerging wear-out defects or intentional attacks on the execution integrity.","","17th IEEE European Test Symposium (ETS), Annecy, FRANCE, MAY 28-JUN 01, 2012","Krieg, A (Corresponding Author), Graz Univ Technol, Inst Tech Informat, A-8010 Graz, Austria.

As an important building block of the ICT system, power system state estimation is of critical importance to maintain normal operation of the smart grid, which, however, is under mounting threat from potential cyber attacks. In this article, we introduce a graph-based framework for performing cyber-security analysis in power system state estimation. Compared to conventional arithmetic-based security analysis, the graphical characterization of state estimation security provides intuitive visualization of some complex problem structures and enables efficient graphical solution algorithms, which are useful for both defending and attacking the ICT system of the smart grid.

Very often, the role of computer systems needs to change as the business environment changes. Initially, the system may only need to host one operating system and seek full execution speed. Later, it may be required to add other functionalities such as allowing easy software/hardware maintenance, surviving system failures and hosting multiple operating systems. Virtualization allows these functionalities to be supported easily and effectively. However, virtualization techniques generally incur non-negligible performance penalty. Fortunately, many virtualization-enabled features such as online software/hardware maintenance and fault tolerance do not require virtualization standby all the time. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a technique, called Self-virtualization, which provides the operating system with the capability to turn on and off virtualization on demand, without disturbing running applications. This technique enables computer systems to reap most benefits from virtualization without sacrificing performance. This paper presents the design and implementation of Mercury, a working prototype based on Linux and Xen virtual machine monitor. The performance measurement shows that Mercury incurs very little overhead: about 0.2 ms on 3 GHz Xeon CPU to complete a mode switch, and negligible performance degradation compared to Linux.","dependability; performance; self-virtualization; dynamic virtualization","","Chen, HB (Corresponding Author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Software, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.

The higher level of uncertainty that stems from this variability makes it more difficult to determine whether a given operating condition will be secure or insecure. Data-driven techniques provide a promising way to identify security rules that can be embedded in economic dispatch model to keep power system operating states secure. This paper proposes using a sparse weighted oblique decision tree to learn accurate, understandable, and embeddable security rules that are linear and can be extracted as sparse matrices using a recursive algorithm. These matrix rules can then be easily embedded as security constraints in power system economic dispatch calculations using the Big-M method. Tests on several large datasets with high renewable energy penetration demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the sparse weighted oblique decision tree outperforms the state-of-art weighted oblique decision tree while keeping the security rules simple. When embedded in the economic dispatch, these rules significantly increase the percentage of secure states and reduce the average solution time.","Security; Decision trees; Power system stability; Economics; Sparse matrices; Optimization; Renewable energy sources; Data-driven; High renewable penetration; Oblique decision tree; Power system security; Sparsity; rules extraction; security-constrained economic dispatch; security-constrained optimal power flow","","Zhang, N (Corresponding Author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, State Key Lab Power Syst, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

An integrated simulation approach is proposed to describe cascading failure propagation resulting from various triggering events, in which steady-state power flow, dynamic gas transmission, and working mode switching of gas compressors are considered. Electricity network islanding, re-dispatching of electricity generation and gas source pressure, as well as electricity and gas load shedding simulate the consequence of interactive cascading failure propagation. When a new steady state of IEGS is reached after the occurrence of an initial failure in either electricity or gas sub-system, the statistical indices with respect to energy supply availability of IEGS are calculated to assess risks caused by the cascading failure, and significances of individual electricity branches and gas pipelines are evaluated. An IEGS, consisting of a 24-bus 35-branch electricity grid and a 28-node 25-branch gas network coupled by two electricity-driven gas compressors and three gas-fired generators, is established to validate the proposed approach. Numerical simulations illustrate distinct characteristics of electricity and gas sub-systems in the cascading failure propagation process as well as different impacts of each sub-system on the other.","Cascading failure; Dynamic gas transmission; Integrated electricity-natural gas system; Steady-state power flow; Evaluation","","Wu, L (Corresponding Author), Stevens Inst Technol, ECE Dept, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.

The model captures emergent behavior resulting from interactions of multiple network agents including the number of workstations, regular, administrator and third-party users, external and internal attacks, defense mechanisms for the network setting, and many other parameters. A risk-based approach to modelling cybersecurity of a business entity is utilized to derive the rate of attacks. A neural network model will generalize the type of attack based on network traffic features allowing dynamic state changes. Rules of engagement to generate self-organizing behavior will be leveraged to appoint a defense mechanism suitable for the attack-state of the model. The effectiveness of the model will be depicted by time-state chart that shows the number of affected assets for the different types of attacks triggered by the entity risk and the time it takes to revert into normal state.

Power system preventive control is an important measure to ensure the safe and stable operation of power systems by adjusting the active generation and nodal voltage of generators. In this paper, a power system preventive control algorithm aided by a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Transient Security Assessment (TSA) surrogate is proposed. A GNN-based fast contingency scanning model is constructed based on power network topology, which can predict the contingency scanning results rapidly only based on the power flow by transforming the original contingency scanning problem into the node classification problem on the GNN. The obtained GNN is then used as a surrogate model for TSA to speed up the solution of particle swarm optimization-based transient security-constrained optimal power flow. Numerical Tests are carried out in the IEEE-39 system and the test results indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve the efficiency without affecting the solution accuracy.

Therefore, methods and techniques should be developed with the main aim of improving power system security against terrorism. To collaborate to this effort this paper proposes an extension of a well known classification of events and operating states. A classification that includes, internal and external natural and unnatural or man caused events is important for proposing new security analysis methods that consider event uncertainties. Natural events are mainly random while unnatural event uncertainty are ambiguous, vague or confuse and some kind of expert elicitation should be applied.

The key feature of the blockchain, immutability, brings resistance to unauthorized modifications. The whole history of device configuration changes is stored in the blockchain, hence recovery after incidents is very straightforward. This paper extends our previous studies. We are introducing an improved architecture for management and monitoring of IoT devices using a private blockchain. The majority of the system is built on a chaincode, which handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as well as encryption and access control. Device configuration files are stored in the blockchain. When a modification occurs, the device downloads a new configuration in a simple manner. The chaincode receives notification whether setup was successful and this history is available for administrators. Our results show that such a system is possible and dissemination of configuration changes to IoT devices can be secured by the blockchain.

Tuna are of particular importance in the tropical Pacific, as they contribute significantly to the livelihoods, food and economic security of island states. Changes in water properties and circulation will impact on tuna larval dispersal, preferred habitat distributions and the trophic systems that support tuna populations throughout the region. Using recent observations and ocean projections from the CMIP3 and preliminary results from CMIP5 climate models, we document the projected changes to ocean temperature, salinity, stratification and circulation most relevant to distributions of tuna. Under a business-as-usual emission scenario, projections indicate a surface intensified warming in the upper 400 m and a large expansion of the western Pacific Warm Pool, with most surface waters of the central and western equatorial Pacific reaching temperatures warmer than 29 degrees C by 2100. These changes are likely to alter the preferred habitat of tuna, based on present-day thermal tolerances, and in turn the distribution of spawning and foraging grounds. Large-scale shoaling of the mixed layer and increases in stratification are expected to impact nutrient provision to the biologically active layer, with flow-on trophic effects on the micronekton. Several oceanic currents are projected to change, including a strengthened upper equatorial undercurrent, which could modify the supply of bioavailable iron to the eastern Pacific.","","","Ganachaud, A (Corresponding Author), IRD, UMR5566, LEGOS, BP A5, Noumea, New Caledonia.

This paper outlines techniques for reincorporating such out of band, low level configuration changes back into the common hierarchical policy model.","Security Policy Model; Policy Management; policy discovery","9th IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM 2005), Nice, FRANCE, MAY, 2005","Hinrichs, S (Corresponding Author), Cisco Syst Inc, 2302 Fox Dr,Suite A, Champaign, IL 61820 USA.

This paper primarily lays emphasis on two methods that are Probabilistic Fuzzy Decision Tree (PFDT) and Case Based Reasoning (CBR). In PFDT, Decision Tree plays an integral role for classification of system. For further classification of power system security, an algorithm is developed to categorise the buses which trouble the security most. After classification of system, by using minimum amount of load curtailment of voltages on buses which made insecure to secure load. Optimization of load is done by curtailing reactive power from insecure buses. In CBR, old cases from database are used for solving the problems of new case. Hence, PFDT is retrained in system during real operation for solving the new operating states which are found insecure in CBR approach. In case of emergency or a critical situation, structure of the power system networks changes but in such a condition CBR also gives better results by using re-training process. After re-training in real-time, CBR revises its database by accepting new conditions and stored for their further uses. These two methods are analysed on the standard test system i.e. IEEE-30 Bus along with desired accuracy. Copyright (C) 2018 The Authors.

In turn, machine learning can be used to construct surrogate models approximating the system's security boundary in the region of operation. To this end, past system history can be useful for generating anticipated system states suitable for training. However, inferring the underlying data model, to allow high-density sampling, is problematic due to the large number of variables, their complex marginal probability distributions and the nonlinear dependence structure they exhibit. In this paper, we adopt the C-Vine pair-copula decomposition scheme; clustering and principal component transformation stages are introduced, followed by a truncation to the pairwise dependency modeling, enabling efficient fitting and sampling of large datasets. Using measurements from the French grid, we show that a machine learning training database sampled from the proposed method can produce binary security classifiers with superior predictive capability compared to other approaches.","Copulas; data clustering; machine learning; Monte Carlo simulation; parametric statistics; principal component analysis; risk assessment; stochastic dependence; uncertainty analysis","","Sun, MY (Corresponding Author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.

The only proper way to protect a smart contract is to fix potential risks in its code before it is deployed to the blockchain. However, existing tools for smart contract security analysis focus on the detection of bugs but seldom consider the code fix issues. Meanwhile, it is often time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to understand and fix flawed code manually. In this paper we propose SMART SHIELD, a bytecode rectification system, to fix three typical security-related bugs (i.e., state changes after external calls, missing checks for out-of-bound arithmetic operations, and missing checks for failing external calls) in smart contracts automatically and help developers release secure contracts. Moreover, SMART SHIELD guarantees that the rectified contract is not only immune to certain attacks but also gas-friendly (i.e., a slightly increase of gas cost). To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of SMART SHIELD, we applied it to 28,621 real-world buggy contracts on Ethereum blockchain (as of January 2nd 2019). Experiment results demonstrated that among 95,502 insecure cases in those contracts, 87,346 (91.5%) of them were automatically fixed by SMART SHIELD. A following test with both program analysis and real-world exploits further testified that the rectified contracts were secure against common attacks. Moreover, the rectification only introduced a 0.2% gas increment for each contract on average.","Ethereum blockchain; Smart contract; Automated bug fix; Bytecode rectification","27th IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER), London, CANADA, FEB 18-21, 2020","Li, JR (Corresponding Author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

As the gap between China's natural gas production and consumption continues to rise, natural gas security becomes a key problem concerned by the whole society. This paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation criteria system, including four dimensions and eight indicators, and constructs an evaluation and prediction model based on set pair analysis, variable weight and high-order Markov chain. Firstly, the state sets of natural gas security evaluation criteria are formed to a set pair. Secondly, the variable weight method was used to calculate the association degree of the set pair and state transferring probability matrix in different time to overcome the problem that the constant weight can not reflect the order importance of the value of criteria. Thirdly, the higher-order Markov chain was proposed to predict the association degree of set pair and to analyze natural gas security situation. Finally, the proposed model is used for China's natural gas security evaluation based on data from 2014 to 2018. The result indicates that natural gas security level shows rising trend in general, and the prediction value shows the future security is still not safe. Thus, some suggestions for improving security are given. Furthermore, the risk attitude of experts has great influence on short-term security analysis and prediction, while the effects on long-term evaluation and prediction are less.","Natural gas security; Set pair analysis; High-order Markov chain; Variable weight","","Yuan, JH (Corresponding Author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

Information security and privacy for WSN is particularly crucial. Cryptographic algorithms are extensively exploited in WSN applications to ensure the security. They are usually implemented in specific chips to achieve high data throughout with less computational resources. Cryptographic hardware should be rigidly tested to guarantee the correctness of encryption operation. Scan design improves significantly the test quality of chips and thus is widely used in semiconductor industry. Nevertheless, scan design provides a backdoor for attackers to deduce the cipher key of a cryptographic core. To protect the security of the cryptographic system we first present a secure scan architecture, in which an automatic test control circuitry is inserted to isolate the cipher key in test mode and clear the sensitive information at mode switching. Then, the weaknesses of this architecture are analyzed and an enhanced scheme using concept of test authorization is proposed. If the correct authorization key is applied within the specific time, the normal test can be performed. Otherwise, only secure scan test can be performed. The enhanced scan scheme ensures the security of cryptographic chips while remaining the advantages of scan design.","cryptography; wireless sensor networks; hardware security; scan-based attack","","Wang, J (Corresponding Author), Changsha Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Comp & Commun Engn, Changsha 410114, Hunan, Peoples R China.

This paper presents an implementation of a novel procedure using which a secured communication between two parties can be carried out using polarized beam of light over an optical fiber. The paper presents the experimental results obtained of the procedure in the lab environment and a security analysis of the same. It is observed that polarization state of a light pulse cannot be retained as it travels over an optical fiber because of the birefringence phenomenon. Multiple environmental factors such as pressure, vibration, temperature, etc. also add a non-linearity to the birefringence of an optical fiber leading towards an unpredictable polarization state changes over the course of an optical fiber. The proposed procedure helps the receiving party to successfully retrieve the data in the form of a polarization state transmitted by the sending party without having any knowledge about the state of polarization at the transmitting end. The paper also explains an added layer of security the procedure provides to the communicating parties to make it difficult for an adversary to fetch the data being transferred. The proposed system does not depend on the wavelength of the light being used, nor does it depend upon the type of the optical fiber used for the communication. Using this procedure, multiple bits of secured information can be sent over an optical fiber in a single polarized pulse and retrieved at the receiving end, also known as Polarization Shift Keying.","Stokes parameters; polarization; optical fiber; channel characterization; polarization shift keying; secured communication","Conference on Next-Generation Optical Communication - Components, Sub-Systems, and Systems V, San Francisco, CA, FEB 16-18, 2016","Punekar, N (Corresponding Author), Univ Oklahoma, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Telecommun Engn Program, 4502 E 41st St, Tulsa, OK 74135 USA.

As the key enabler of a smart grid, numerous sensors such as PMU and current sensors transmit real-time dynamic data, which is usually protected by encryption algorithm from malicious attacks, over wide-area-network (WAN) to power system control centers so that monitoring and control of the whole system is possible.

In this paper, we take power nodes (sites) as platforms to experimentally study ways of energy consumptions in different security algorithms. First, we measure energy consumptions of various security algorithms on CrossBow and Ember sensor nodes. Second, we propose an array of novel code optimization methods to increase energy consumption efficiency of different security algorithms.

Recently, radio frequency (RF) fingerprint-based identification schemes have attracted wide attention as they extract the inherent characteristics of hardware circuits which is very hard to forge. However, existing RF fingerprint-based approaches face the problems of unstable region of interest (ROI), high-cost feature design, and incomplete automation. To address these problems, this paper proposes a multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract RF fingerprint from the selected ROI for classifying ZigBee devices. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptive ROI selection algorithm is also developed to alleviate the effect of semi-steady behavior of ZigBee devices owing to sleep mode switching. The proposed MSCNN uses multiple downsampling transformations for multiscale feature extraction and classification automatically. To validate and evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we design a testbed consisting of one low-cost universal software radio peripheral (USRP) as the receiver and 54 CC2530 devices as targets for identification. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MSCNN both in the line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. The classification accuracy is as high as 97% under the LOS scenarios around SNR = 30 dB. Our scheme is robust over a wide range of SNRs under the LOS scenarios as well as under the NLOS scenarios.","Multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN); radio frequency (RF) fingerprint; region of interest (ROI) selection; semi-steady portion; ZigBee","","Hu, AQ (Corresponding Author), Southeast Univ, Inst Informat Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

We take into account both antenna mode switching and destination selection for the amplify and forward relaying network. The untrusted relay (UR) is equipped with two antennas, where one antenna that maximizes the source-to-relay channel gain will be selected for reception and the other one is exploited to forward the processed information. Moreover, the Nth best destination is considered as the legitimate destination, which aims to achieve a better secrecy rate. Specially, in general signal-to-noise ratio regime, a low-complexity Gaussian Q-function is introduced to derive the exact closed-form expression of ergodic secrecy rate (ESR). In addition, when the UR works in a non-linear energy harvesting mode, the achievable secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated and solved by an alternative optimization method. The simulation results reveal the correctness of the theoretical derivation and also proves that much higher secrecy performance can be achieved by the proposed scheme than other benchmark schemes.

This article presents a data set on interstate transfers of major weapon systems between 1950 and 2010 building upon Stockholm Peach Research Institute's Arms Trade Register with several improvements. First, it disaggregates land weapons and air weapons into categories reflecting their strategic capabilities. Second, model level characteristics (e.g. age, speed, and range) are drawn from Jane's Defence sources. Additionally, the data set covers a larger range of time and states than previous data sets categorizing arms. To demonstrate the usefulness, this article first presents summary statistics of the data set and then replicates an earlier test to show that the effect of human rights and regime types on United States transfers differs across the categories of arms compared to alternative measures of arms transfers.","Arms transfers; Arms trade; Data set; Major weapon systems; International security","","Johnson, RAI (Corresponding Author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Polit, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.

For a given disturbance, it calculates the power flow, evaluates the vulnerability and security, identifies the vulnerable part, finds the transmission line overload and bus voltage problems, and predicts the possible successive events. The approach defines the control means using the following methods for early detection and prevention of cascading events: network contribution factor (NCF), generator distribution factor (GDF), load distribution factor (LDF), and selected minimum load shedding (SMLS). This approach has been tested using the IEEE RTS-96 24-bus system and promising results have been obtained.

These transactions adversely affect power system security, and are thus executed only as far as the system design and operating conditions permit. Therefore, fast assessment of the impact of such transactions is one of the prime responsibilities of any system operator. This paper presents a scheme for comprehensive assessment of the impact of multiple, simultaneous bilateral transactions on the operating state of the transmission network. It employs improved distribution factors derived from the base case Jacobian matrix, for computation of voltage and real power flow (and real power loss). Results are presented for three standard test systems, and a comparison with the AC load flow results (and results obtained using DC power flow based distribution factors) shows that the method is fairly accurate.

Meanwhile, the power system operator may conduct defensive measures to prevent virus-spreading. In this paper, a graphical evolutionary game model is developed to solve the equilibrium of competitions between virus propagations and countermeasures, which helps to evaluate the cyber-security risk of power systems under long-term virus-based intrusions. In the proposed game model, the virus is supposed to propagate itself in a cyber network connecting cyber nodes belonging to power substations. Each cyber node may play as an attacker or a defender according to its state. A death-birth rule is adopted to model probabilistic strategies and state transfers, which reflects the bounded rationality of the viruses. Then, an evolution dynamic equation is derived to obtain the portion of the infected substations when the equilibrium is reached, and simulation algorithm is also given to estimate the infection probability of each substation under the persistent virus-based intrusion. Assuming a virus may trip all breakers in the infected substation, the cyber-security risk is evaluated to identify system-level vulnerabilities. The IEEE 118-bus system with a layered cyber network is used for case studies. Test results validate the proposed model and provide further insights into the virus-based intrusion.","Cyber security; graphical evolutionary game; virus spread; substation risk assessment","","Huang, SW (Corresponding Author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, State Key Lab Power Syst, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

Therefore, an increasing number of exploits and malicious applications for Android are developed by attackers. Many Android applications have malicious or abnormal behaviour: stealing private information, subscribing to unwanted paid services, consuming a large amount of resources on the device and displaying unwanted advertisements. Students learning security need to understand the behaviour of such applications. In this paper, we propose an infrastructure for collecting information pertaining to application behaviour at runtime and exposing the malicious and atypical actions performed by Android applications. The purpose of this infrastructure is to provide a meaningful learning experience to students, as they study malicious applications. The infrastructure includes collectors at every level of the operating system and the behaviour information includes: the consumed resources (CPU, memory), the exchanged messages (SMSs, phone calls, packets), the state changes of the communication channels (WiFi, 3G, Bluetooth, NFC). Behaviour information is sent periodically from the collectors to a native application and can be visualised through a Graphical User Interface, directly on the mobile device. Students are allowed to select any process in the system and investigate its behaviour in real time. They also can extract the behaviour information from the mobile device in order to perform statistical analysis on the data. Students are able compare the collected data for legitimate and malicious/abnormal applications and identify the malicious behaviour patterns. These patterns can be used to discover new malware, that is not yet detected by commercial antivirus solutions. The learning experience provided by our infrastructure is essential for developing practical security skills.","Android; security; malware","11th International Scientific Conference on eLearning and Software for Education (eLSE), Bucharest, ROMANIA, APR 23-24, 2015","Gheorghe, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Fac Automat Control & Comp, Splaiul Independentei 313, Bucharest, Romania.

Enclaves comprise code and data that is executed under special protection of the CPU and can only be accessed via an enclave defined interface. To facilitate the usability of this new system abstraction, Intel offers a software development kit (SGX SDK). While the SDK eases the use of SGX, it misses appropriate programming support for inter-enclave interaction, and demands to hardcode the exact use of trusted execution into applications, which restricts flexibility. This paper proposes EActors, an actor framework that is tailored to SGX and offers a more seamless, flexible and efficient use of trusted execution - especially for applications demanding multiple enclaves. EActors disentangles the interaction with enclaves and, among them, from costly execution mode transitions. It features lightweight fine-grained parallelism based on the concept of actors, thereby avoiding costly SGX SDK provided synchronisation constructs. Finally, EActors offers a high degree of freedom to execute actors, either untrusted or trusted, depending on security requirements and performance demands. We implemented two use cases on top of EActors: (i) a secure instant messaging service, and (ii) a secure multi-party computation service. Both illustrate the ability of EActors to seamlessly and effectively build secure applications. Furthermore, our performance evaluation results show that securing the messaging service with EActors improves performance compared to the vanilla versions of JabberD2 and ejabberd by up to 40x.","Actors; Intel SGX; Trusted Execution","19th ACM/IFIP/USENIX Middleware Conference, Rennes, FRANCE, DEC 10-14, 2018","Sartakov, VA (Corresponding Author), TU Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany.

The power system security assessment deals with finding out the secure and the insecure operating states, whereas the security enhancement deals with the necessary control action against overloads under contingency scenario. By generation rescheduling the overloaded lines can be relieved from the severity. In the proposed ECS algorithm, in order to improve the solution vectors, dynamically variable parameters namely the step size and the probability are incorporated instead of the fixed values of the parameters. The CCELD problem includes scheduling of generators to minimize the severity index with minimum fuel cost. A standard IEEE-30 bus system is considered to study the effectiveness of the proposed ECS algorithm for CCELD problem. Numerical results reveals that, for 100 iterations the proposed ECS algorithm out performs the other state-of-the-art algorithms, namely cuckoo search (CS), Bat algorithm (BA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in obtaining the minimum fuel cost and the minimum severity index in minimum time. Thus, the proposed ECS algorithm is found to be efficient to obtain the solution of contingency constrained economic load dispatch problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

An interruption identification framework's principle aspiration is to sort exercises of a framework into two key classes: standard and suspicious exercises. Most IDS business devices are abuse frameworkswith principle-based master framework structure. Be that as it may, these strategies are less effective when assault qualities shift from inherent marks.

In this paper, we have considered distinctive fluffy methodologies for interruption identification framework utilizing fuzzy set hypothesis, and we dissect fuzzy standard, expressly for peculiarity-based assault finding. For structure inconsistency framework, neural systems likewise can be utilized, on the grounds that they can figure out how to segregate the ordinary and anomalous conduct of a framework from models. Along these lines, they offer a promising strategy for structure oddity frameworks. Fake neural systems give the possibility to recognize and arrange organized action dependent on constrained, fragmented and nonlinear information sources.

There exist a manifold of different reasons for system failures of devices starting from short-circuits, hardware defects or malware infections reaching to power shortages or complete blackouts. Moreover, the increase of the number of devices within the airport infrastructure system leads to a tremendous demand of computational assistance systems for operations management. As most devices within the airport are directly connected to processes, there is a high demand for identifying and managing system failures immediately and increase the system resilience. Thus, we introduce process-oriented-grouping of network devices and use linear algebra to relate the impact of system state changes to airport processes, such as check-in, security checks et cetera. This connection between system state and processes is inevitable for a successful combination of computational approaches to determine physical state variations, induced by power grid instabilities and/or cyber-attacks, and process oriented simulation methods. Matrix relations between system states, process capacities, waiting times are given and applied to a small, at this state fictional airport infrastructure. This application shows that forecasting of quantitative values for airport processes is a beneficial tool for airport infrastructure management. Moreover, linear algebra properties prove to be a strong tool in analyzing network properties, such as infrastructure diversity and process capacities, which play a major role within resource management. However, at the moment our approach is only suitable as a supporting tool for human decision making. Nevertheless the approach can be enhanced as intelligent health monitoring system for airports.","","Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS), Herndon, VA, APR 09-11, 2019","Koch, T (Corresponding Author), German Aerosp Ctr DLR, Braunschweig, Germany.

Based on a literature review, 55 potential assessment methods were selected and their distinctive indicators identified. The methods were classified according to their position in the DPSIR framework [chain of Drivers, Pressures, State (changes), Impacts, and Responses], and into 15 environmental issues at three levels. The selection was narrowed down to eight, based on the availability of reliable methods, their relevance to agri-food systems, their frequent application for diets, and their recommendation by international bodies. (1) At the global (supra) level, the planetary boundaries approach addresses the current global environmental (change in) state and helps to prioritize the most pressing issues related to the agri-food system as a driver. These issues are climate change, nitrogen and phosphorus cycle disruption, land-use change, and freshwater use. (2) At the national (macro) level, the footprints approach is used to identify indicators. This footprint family includes ecological, land, carbon, energy, and water footprints. International bodies support these key indicators, but they recommend complementary assessment methods for nitrogen and phosphorus flows, soil health, and pesticide use. (3) At the product (micro) level, life cycle assessment includes 11 pressure indicators. Of the latter, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) and land use (LU) are the most frequently used indicators in diet studies. We conclude that GHGEs and LU fulfill the selection criteria and address most of the environmental impact of diets well. In the future, these indicators should be supplemented with an indicator addressing the nitrogen and phosphorous efficiency of food products.","Ecological footprint; Environmental indicators; Life cycle assessment; Planetary boundaries; Sustainable diet","","van Dooren, C (Corresponding Author), Netherlands Nutr Ctr, Eisenhowerlaan 108, NL-2508 CK The Hague, Netherlands. van Dooren, Corne, Netherlands Nutr Ctr, Eisenhowerlaan 108, NL-2508 CK The Hague, Netherlands.

Given the trend toward interconnecting OT and IT networks for business reasons, and given the disclosure of highly sophisticated attacks against OT environments, OT network operators increasingly recognize the need to deploy security solutions that are widely known in IT also to OT. OT networks are running critical control processes. Configuration changes are avoided to reduce the risk of misconfiguration or unforeseeable side effects detrimental to the network's operation. Therefore, passive non-intrusive security technologies are favored. Consequently, security intelligence applied to passively collected network data is the most acceptable technology to be deployed in OT networks.

In this paper the authors will report on the design, implementation, performance and issues encountered during and post project execution. These intelligent DTT systems have been designed to increase availability of the DG by preventing the indiscriminate disconnection of the sites. Traditionally Direct Transfer Trip Signals (DTT) has been sent between substations and remote Distributed Generation (DG) sites using leased telephone lines. If DTT communication is interrupted, the DTT system will disconnect the DG site. Leased copper lines are becoming less reliable, leading to unwanted disconnection of DG sites. Installation of fiber is not always feasible due to the cost. This paper will discuss an approach to provide DTT signals using wireless communications. The paper will address the security concerns that many Utilities might face. Two new innovations to increase the DG site's availability will be discussed. 1) Automatic Direct Transfer Close If system conditions return to normal after a DTT event, the system will automatically close the DG site back in onto the feeder. 2) Dynamic Feeder State change protection function. Using cellular or wireless communication systems it must be expected that there will be communication interruptions during normal maintenance actions. During these times the DG site device activates a new protection function that will detect any anomalies that could constitute a change in the connected feeder systems (e.g. caused by a fault or the opening of a breaker) and then only disconnect the DG site.","","72nd Annual Conference for Protective Relay Engineers (CPRE), Texas A&M Univ, College Station, TX, MAR 25-28, 2019","","English","Annual Conference for Protective Relay Engineers"

The amount of information carried by communication networks is expanding, and if a cyber system fails or operates abnormally, the defect may propagate across space to the entire system. In this paper, a routing optimization method of cyber-energy systems is proposed to optimize information operations and respond to cyber attacks. To account for the difference in information demand between electricity and gas, we describe the communication business and determine the business's importance using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy approach. The risk assessment model is improved by analyzing the structural vulnerability of the energy system based on complex network theory. To coordinate various conditions, the approach is split into preventative and emergency control modes. The Yen algorithm and the fuzzy membership function are coupled in the preventative control mode to simultaneously optimize load balancing and communication risk. In the event of cyber attacks, the emergency control mode is triggered, which employs emergency isolation to minimize fault propagation and to preserve system stability in a partially disconnected operating state. Finally, the method's effectiveness is illustrated through using IEEE 30 bus and gas 13 node coupling system.","Cyber-energy system; Routing optimization; Joint optimization; Across-space cascading fault","","Chen, J (Corresponding Author), Shandong Univ, Key Lab Power Syst Intelligent Dispatch & Control, Jinan 250061, Peoples R China.

In order to take into account the load uncertainty, in this paper the authors apply a Monte-Carlo method together with an opportune Security Index to evaluate in a preventive manner the probability to fall in insecure operating state, by determining the security index probability density function. For this aim, in a previous paper proposed by the authors, it has been possible to take advantage of an Artificial Neural Network, trained to evaluate the Security Index probability density function in presence of the optimal economical dispatching of the generation powers for the load forecast. In the present paper, a more complex scenario is considered where the security analysis can suggest to the dispatcher to determine also non-optimal economical operating conditions to improve security. So a new, more complex, organization of the Artificial Neural Network training stage, necessary in order to obtain increased generalization capacity in the production stage, has been considered. In the first part of the paper the used security index, the Monte-Carlo simulation and the neural network structure with its learning algorithm utilized by the authors for the particular problem are briefly recalled.

All these attacks are centered around a common set of behaviors: During speculative execution, the architectural state of the system is kept unmodified, until the speculation can be verified. In the event that a misspeculation occurs, then anything that can affect the architectural state is reverted (squashed) and re-executed correctly. However, the same is not true for the microarchitectural state. Normally invisible to the user, changes to the microarchitectural state can be observed through various side-channels, with timing differences caused by the memory hierarchy being one of the most common and easy to exploit. The speculative side-channels can then be exploited to perform attacks that can bypass software and hardware checks in order to leak information. These attacks, out of which the most infamous are perhaps Spectre and Meltdown, have led to a frantic search for solutions. In this work, we present our own solution for reducing the microarchitectural state-changes caused by speculative execution in the memory hierarchy. It is based on the observation that if we only allow accesses that hit in the L1 data cache to proceed, then we can easily hide any microarchitectural changes until after the speculation has been verified. At the same time, we propose to prevent stalls by value predicting the loads that miss in the L1. Value prediction, though speculative, constitutes an invisible form of speculation, not seen outside the core. We evaluate our solution and show that we can prevent observable microarchitectural changes in the memory hierarchy while keeping the performance and energy costs at 11% and 7%, respectively. In comparison, the current state of the art solution, InvisiSpec, incurs a 46% performance loss and a 51% energy increase.","speculative execution; side-channel attacks; caches","46th International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) / Workshop on Computer Architecture Education (WCAE), Phoenix, AZ, JUN 22-26, 2019","Sakalis, C (Corresponding Author), Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden.

In this paper, we describe a methodology for analyzing and understanding the RBAC-configuration evolution, its relation to the overall evolutionary lifecycle of industrial systems, and its impact on security vulnerabilities from which the system may suffer. Our methodology considers two different sources of information regarding the RBAC-configuration evolution: 1) the role-permissions matrices of subsequent system versions; and 2) the corresponding concept lattices, implied by these matrices. By examining the evolution of these two system properties, developers can easily notice which versions involve-more and more complex RBAC-configuration changes that may indicate higher security risks.

This paper proposes two artificial neural networks namely multi-layer feed forward neural network (MFNN) and radial basis function network (RBFN) to realize the online power system static security assessment (PSSSA) module. To assess the severity of the system, two indices have been used, namely active power performance index and voltage performance index, which are computed using Newton Raphson load flow (NRLF) analysis for variable loading conditions under N - 1 line outage contingencies. The proposed MFNN and RBFN models based PSSSA module, are fed with power system operating states, load conditions and N - 1 line outage contingencies as input features to train the neural network models, to predict the performance indices for unseen network conditions and rank them in descending order based on performance indices for security assessment. The proposed approaches are tested on standard IEEE 30-bus test system, where the simulation results prove its performance and robustness for power system static security assessment. The comparison of severity obtained by the neural network models and the NRLF analysis in terms of time and accuracy, signifies that the proposed model is quick, accurate and robust for power system static security evaluation for unseen network conditions. Thus, the proposed PSSSA module implemented using MFNN and RBFN models are found to be feasible for online implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this costs performance, prompting the use of value prediction (VP) to regain some of the delay. However, the problem cannot be solved by simply introducing a new kind of speculation (value prediction). Value-predicted loads have to be validated, which cannot be commenced until the load becomes nonspeculative. Thus, value-predicted loads occupy the same amount of precious core resources (e.g., reorder buffer entries) as Delay-on-Miss. The end result is that VP only yields marginal benefits over Delay-on-Miss. In this paper, our insight is that we can achieve the same goal as VP (increasing performance by providing the value of loads that miss) without incurring its negative side-effect (delaying the release of precious resources), if we can safely, non-speculatively, recompute a value in isolation (without being seen from the outside), so that we do not expose any information by transferring such a value via the memory hierarchy. Value Recomputation, which trades computation for data transfer was previously proposed in an entirely different context: to reduce energy-expensive data transfers in the memory hierarchy. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of value recomputation in relation to the Delay-on-Miss approach of hiding speculation, discuss the trade-offs, and show that we can achieve the same level of security, reaching 93% of the unsecured baseline performance (5% higher than Delay-on-miss), and exceeding (by 3%) what even an oracular (100% accuracy and coverage) value predictor could do.","","IEEE International Symposium on Secure and Private Execution Environment Design (SEED), ELECTR NETWORK, SEP 20-21, 2021","Sakalis, C (Corresponding Author), Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden.

Graphical security models (e.g., Attack Graphs and Attack Trees) and security metrics (e.g., attack cost, shortest attack path) are widely used to systematically analyse the security posture of network systems. However, there are problems using them to assess the security of dynamic networks. First, the existing graphical security models are unable to capture dynamic changes occurring in the networks over time. Second, the existing security metrics are not designed for dynamic networks such that their effectiveness to the dynamic changes in the network is still unknown. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis via simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of security metrics using a Temporal Hierarchical Attack Representation Model. Further, we investigate the varying effects of security metrics when changes are observed in the dynamic networks. Our experimental analysis shows that different security metrics have varying security posture changes with respect to changes in the network.","Attack Graphs; Attack Trees; Cyber Security; Graphical Security Models; Security Assessment","16th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications / The 11th IEEE International Conference on Big Data Science and Engineering / The 14th IEEE International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems, Sydney, AUSTRALIA, AUG 01-04, 2017","Yusuf, SE (Corresponding Author), Univ Canterbury, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Christchurch, New Zealand.

Different mitigation techniques have been proposed in the literature that aims to mitigate these attacks by randomizing the address to cache location mappings. The security guarantees in these schemes are based on the degree of difficulty for an attacker to reliably determine the cache lines accessed by the victim within practical time settings. However, prior attacks have shown that newer and more improved algorithms can be envisaged that discover conflicting sets in the secured randomized caches. In this work, we first categorize different types of cache designs into four broad classes based on the extent of non-determinism and randomness of allocating an address in those caches. We then develop a mathematical framework to formally analyse the security implications of the randomized and partitioned cache designs in terms of collision probability, self-collision probability and size of the eviction set required to perform a successful eviction-based attack. We further empirically demonstrate set associative eviction on recently proposed randomization schemes called Mirage and Scattercache. Next, we propose two algorithms to generate efficient eviction set on these schemes and analytically evaluate the efficacy of our algorithms against the one proposed in the literature. Finally, we argue that mere randomization using a cryptographic primitive as used in popular schemes like Scattercache, CEASER-S, Mirage etc. does not provide the required randomness. Although the randomized-partitioned caches provide some resilience against eviction-set generation techniques, they are still vulnerable to eviction-based attacks.","","29th IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), Montreal, CANADA, FEB 25-MAR 01, 2023","Chakraborty, A (Corresponding Author), Indian Inst Technol, Kharagpur, W Bengal, India.

Consumer loads and DER's generation were extended from static values to typical load and generation profiles, which examined daily, weekly, and seasonal patterns. Protection device settings were calculated selectively in the absence of DERs. Using the method of Protection Security Assessment (PSA), automatically evaluate the correct operation of protection devices in case of different fault scenarios. Three-phase and single-phase metallic faults are applied to validate protection system security. The PSA reassessed DER contribution and influence on protection selectivity.

The connection of wind farms may affect the original oscillation modes of the system, and may also introduce new oscillation modes. To ensure the security and stability of the system, it is necessary to assess the running state of the system and evaluate the development direction of the small signal stability on the premise of taking volatility into account. It is also important to fast adjust the system when an unstable state happened. The method in this paper provides a new way to accurately evaluate and adjust the stability of the system integrated with wind farms. Broad learning system (BLS) is a non-fixed model and has the potential of incremental learning. A BLS model is trained to evaluate the damping ratio sensitivity in different operating states. The adjustment part will use the optimal adjustment model and damping ratio sensitivity to adjust unstable systems. The superior performance of the model proposed in this paper is tested by the case study based on the IEEE 3-machine, 9-bus, and the New-England 10-machine, 39-bus.

We focus on the retirement income gap (RIG) between immigrants from non-European Union countries and relate its magnitude to country differences in welfare state arrangements. Ethnic inequality after retirement is substantial: after adjusting for key characteristics including age, education and occupational status, the average immigrant penalty across the 16 countries is 28 per cent for men and 29 per cent for women. Country-level regressions show that income gaps are smaller in countries where the pension system is more redistributive. We also find that easy access to long-term residence is associated with larger RIGs, at least for men.

For a realistic power network, however, with numerous contingencies considered, the overall problem size becomes intractable for single-core optimization tools in short time frames established by real-time industrial operations. We propose a parallel distributed memory structure exploiting framework, BELTISTOS-SC, which accelerates the solution of SCOPF problems over state of the art techniques. The acceleration on single-core execution is achieved by a structure-exploiting interior point method, employing successive Schur complement evaluations to further reduce the size of the systems solved at each iteration while maintaining sparsity, resulting in lower computational resources for the linear system solution. Additionally the parallel, distributed memory implementation of the proposed framework is also presented in detail and validated through several large-scale examples, demonstrating its efficiency for large-scale SCOPF problems.","Security constraints; optimal power flow; non-linear programming; interior point method; parallel algorithms","","Schenk, O (Corresponding Author), Univ Svizzera Italiana, Inst Computat Sci, Adv Comp Lab, CH-6904 Lugano, Switzerland.

A malicious insider like a compromised cloud administrator can affect security of data and workloads belonging to cloud customers. Enforcing the least privilege principle in cloud administration can fairly restrict the permissions of administrators and reduce the attack surface. However, writing a least privilege policy can be hard and error prone for cloud service providers. In this paper, we propose a framework called Least Privilege for Cloud (LPCloud) to address these concerns. LPCloud automatically produces policies for minimization of administrators' privileges at the granularity of representational state transfer (REST) application program interfaces (API), and enforces the policies without affecting current systems. Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithm to partition privileges based on dependencies between API calls. This paper presents design of LPCloud, including a service called Policy Generator which produces partitioned policies and a component named Policy Enforcer to enforce the policies.

Various countries and social organizations build a network security vulnerability database based on big data analysis technology, use network offensive and defensive platforms to train network security talents, and the target environment as a core component in the offensive and defensive platforms plays an important role in practice. We construct a large network security data set with a security knowledge system, analyze the current construction technology and vulnerability data characteristics of major vulnerability databases at home and abroad from multiple levels, and propose a vulnerability information correlation technology based on a combination of general vulnerability numbers and specific vulnerability numbers. Also, we comprehensively analyze each vulnerability database, assess the comprehensiveness and coverage of the vulnerability data information covered, and establish the source of the vulnerability data, data reference, security content automation protocol support, proof of concept, platform environment affected by the vulnerability exploitation code situation, and other fields of network security big data sets with security knowledge system. Here, we have completed the design and implementation of the user rights management module, the centralized monitoring module, and the service desk and configuration change management module. The system can accurately monitor the operation of the system in real time, find problems in time, warn of potential risks, and promote the operation and maintenance approach to intelligent. The transformation has improved the efficiency of fault diagnosis and greatly enhanced the safety of the system. Experimental research shows that the software system automatically screens and manually confirms the vulnerabilities that meet the target construction environment, and initially constructs a total of 43 effective target environments, which provides security researchers with the understanding of vulnerability principles, hazards, and targeted network security training.

However, in such inherent low-inertia systems, randomness and fluctuation of the output power of RESs and uncertain load consumption can easily incur dynamic stability issues, such as transient power impact, unacceptable frequency deviations, and operation mode transitions for security. To solve the above problems and enhance the dynamic stability of the system, an enhanced dynamic stability control (EDSC) scheme with locally measured signals only is proposed in this paper. In this control scheme, the bi-directional interlinking dc-ac converter uses the ac frequency in ac MG as the reference value of dc voltage and adopts the current feedforward control to control the dc voltage in the dc MG to be consistent with the ac frequency. By electrically coupling dc voltage and ac frequency, power disturbances in ac or dc sides will cause almost identical variation degrees in both ac frequency and dc voltage. Under the proposed EDSC scheme, the distributed ESSs in both ac and dc sides are then automatically coordinated and controlled by the unified droop control to balance transient power disturbances and smooth output of diesel generator under normal condition, which can effectively improve stability and controllability of such low-inertia systems. Furthermore, in an emergency such as failure of diesel generator, the operation mode can be switched seamlessly with the proposed EDSC scheme. The detailed theoretical analysis including control system design, small signal model analysis of key parameter influence on system dynamics, and simulation verifications in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment is presented to verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed EDSC scheme.","Low-inertia hybrid ac/dc microgrids; distributed energy storage systems; enhanced dynamic stability control; transient power sharing; seamless transition","","Zhu, JB (Corresponding Author), Tianjin Univ, Key Lab Smart Grid, Minist Educ, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.

The authorization mechanisms of the existing clouds fail to supply two key elements: unified access control and flexible support for different policies. Moreover, different clouds usually provide distinct access control concepts and policy languages. This might cause confusion for customers whose business is distributed in multiple clouds. In this paper, we propose a multi-policy authorization framework called MultiPol to support various access control policies for OpenStack. The end users can customize or even integrate different policies together to form a single decision via logical connectors. This paper presents the design and implementation of MultiPol, including a new service called Policy Service and an attachment module called Request Filter. Experiments on OpenStack show that MultiPol has improved the flexibility and security of policy management without affecting other services. Meantime, the average performance overhead is as low as 7.8%, which is acceptable for practical use. Since MultiPol is built on REST, it is also adaptive to other clouds which also provide RESTful interfaces.","Representational state transfer; Access control; OpenStack; Multi-policy","18th International Conference on Information and Communications Security (ICICS), Singapore, SINGAPORE, NOV 29-DEC 02, 2016","Wu, ZH (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Currently, Apps provide label that contains a combination of developer info, memory size, category, operating system compatibility, user ratings and reviews, and privacy policy. However, the product label information is asymmetrical and it varies with the developer. It is challenging to develop common standards explicit to users, as their needs are dynamic; moreover, the App undergoes a series of state changes during execution, according to the usage pattern. We propose a quantification label framework to assess the mobile/web App using a set of quantifiers, such as functionality, degree and domain of connectivity, battery consumption, and its vulnerability index for generating a set of standard labels. The corresponding labels in the label frame are: features, popularity, energy consumption and security. Further, we utilized principal component analysis (PCA), a statistical technique to assist the customers in selecting the prominent features from the dataset and to compare related apps, which analyzes the quantifiers in the given datasets and distinguish them according to the variances. The experimental results in quantifying a real time traffic data of an internet based App validated the proposed label by revealing the key features to the users; moreover, PCA carried out on four sets of traffic data enabled the selection of prominent data, and the results also revealed the possible embedding of the framework within an App for dynamic monitoring.","App Label; Degree of Connectivity; Energy Consumption; Principal Component Analysis; Quantification; Security; Vulnerability","","Habib, SJ (Corresponding Author), Kuwait Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Kuwait, Kuwait.

The necessary entangled states for teleportation do not need to be prepared in advance in the initial phase and can be produced naturally via quantum walk in the signature phase. Furthermore, to resist against Bob's existential forgery for Alice's signature under known message attack in the previous arbitrated quantum signature proposals, we employ a random number and a public board in the verification phase. Security analyses show the suggested scheme is with impossibility of disavowal of Alice and Bob, impossibility of forgery of anyone.

Streaming refers to downloading software to client hardware platforms for temporary local execution. OS and application software is managed from a centralized server and provided only on-demand. Users obtain a clean, consistent, current build each time they log in, removing the nuisance of security patching and rebooting for environmental changes. Local execution and caching preserves user experience comparable to traditionally installed applications. To explore feasibility, Intel conducted a Proof-of-Concept (POC) to evaluate streaming in its call center and manufacturing environments on multi-user systems. The four-part study included performance, usability, IT operations and total cost of ownership (TCO). The proof-of-concept was successful in identifying streaming as a feasible technology with good performance and positive TCO in the tested scenarios. The biggest benefits were related to locking down the client and thus eliminating service calls related to configuration changes, software installation and viruses. The major challenges encountered were around the high learning curve and the software maturity related to packing applications for streaming. Based on the strong positive outcome of the POC, Intel has added streaming to its IT roadmaps.","","Portland International Conference on Management Engineering and Technology, Univ Pretoria, Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA, JUL 27-31, 2008","","English","Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology"

For the detection of HTs, a non-destructive detection method based on RFF is proposed in this paper. Based on the proposed method, the detection of HTs can be achieved without integrating additional devices in the receiver, which reduces associated costs and energy consumption. QPSK and triangular-wave signals are measured and identified via experimentation, and the results validate the proposed method. For identifying the presence and operating state of Trojan, the average accuracy achieved measures as high as 98.7%.

Consider, for example, systems controlling electric power plants and e-banking servers. Nevertheless, security patches and a constant stream of new operating system versions need to be deployed without stopping running programs. These factors naturally lead to a pressing demand for live update-upgrading all or parts of the operating system without rebooting. Unfortunately, existing solutions require significant manual intervention and thus work reliably only for small operating system patches. In this paper, we describe an automated system for live update that can safely and automatically handle major upgrades without rebooting. We have implemented our ideas in PROTEOS, a new research OS designed with live update in mind. PROTEOS relies on system support and nonintrusive instrumentation to handle even very complex updates with minimal manual effort. The key novelty is the idea of state quiescence, which allows updates to happen only in safe and predictable system states. A second novelty is the ability to automatically perform transactional live updates at the process level, ensuring a safe and stable update process. Unlike prior solutions, PROTEOS supports automated state transfer, state checking, and hot rollback. We have evaluated PROTEOS on 50 real updates and on novel live update scenarios. The results show that our techniques can effectively support both simple and complex updates, while outperforming prior solutions in terms of flexibility, security, reliability, and stability of the update process.","Design; Experimentation; Reliability; Live update; Automatic updates; State transfer; State checking; Update safety; Operating systems","18th International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, Houston, TX, MAR 16-20, 2013","Giuffrida, C (Corresponding Author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

While this revolution promises to transform silicon markets and drive a number of disruptive changes in society, it is also the case that the protocols, complexity, and security issues of extremely large dynamic, co-mingled networks is still poorly understood. Furthermore, embedded system developers, to include military and aerospace users, have largely ignored the potential (good and bound) of the cloudlike, possibly intermingling networks having variable structure to how future systems might be engineered. In this paper, we consider a new interpretation of IoT inspired modular architecture strategies involving the representational state transfer (REST) model, in which dynamic networks with variable structure employ stateless application programming interface (API) concepts. The power of the method, which extends concepts originally developed for space plug-and-play avionics, is that it allows for the fluid co-mingling of hardware and software in networks whose structure can overlap and evolve. Paradoxically, these systems may have the most stringent determinism and fault-tolerant needs. In this paper we review how RESTful APIs can potentially be used to design, create, test, and deploy systems rapidly while addressing security and referential integrity even when the nodes of many systems might physically co-mingle. We will also explore ways to take advantage of the RESTful paradigm for fault tolerance and what extensions might be necessary to deal with high-performance and determinism.","internet of things; modular; open systems architecture; plug-and-play; REST API","21st Conference on Open Architecture/Open Business Model Net-Centric Systems and Defense Transformation, Baltimore, MD, APR 19-20, 2016","Lyke, J (Corresponding Author), Air Force Res Lab, 3550 Aberdeen Ave SW, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117 USA.

The paper gives high accuracy security classification without the need for a very big size training set. The problem has been solved in two stages. In the first stage an approximate classifier is to be found corresponding to a reasonable number of operating states. The neural network used in this stage has no hidden layers,as only approximate classifier is needed, which reduces the training procedure effort. In the second stage a training set is then to be generated in the space around this approximate classifier using an appropriate step by step mathematical technique. A multilayer neural network is then to be trained by this new training set to get a high accuracy classifier. A corrective action is also suggested. When insecure case is detected,in the real life operation, corrective action must take place to take the system from the insecure to the secure state. This call be done by using the approximate classifier expression and the power balance equation at first to move the insecure operating point to the secure region. The new operating point is then to be checked using the high accuracy classifier, if found insecure it can be easily moved to a new point and then rechecked until the point attains the security state. The suggested technique has been tested on a sample power system and gave very satisfactory results.","","American Power Conference, at the 61st Annual Meeting of the Illinois-Institute-of-Technology on Innovation for Economy and Reliability, CHICAGO, IL, 1999","El-Shibini, MA (Corresponding Author), Cairo Univ, Fac Engn, Cairo, Egypt.

Overall, warming and drying may reduce crop yields by 10-20% to 2050, but there are places where losses are likely to be much more severe. Increasing frequencies of heat stress, drought and flooding events will result in yet further deleterious effects on crop and livestock productivity. There will be places in the coming decades where the livelihood strategies of rural people may need to change, to preserve food security and provide income-generating options. These are likely to include areas of Africa that are already marginal for crop production; as these become increasingly marginal, then livestock may provide an alternative to cropping. We carried out some analysis to identify areas in sub-Saharan Africa where such transitions might occur. For the currently cropped areas (which already include the highland areas where cropping intensity may increase in the future), we estimated probabilities of failed seasons for current: climate conditions, and compared these with estimates obtained for future climate conditions in 2050, using downscaled climate model output for a higher and a lower greenhouse-gas emission scenario. Transition zones can be identified where the increased probabilities of failed seasons may induce shifts from cropping to increased dependence on livestock. These zones are characterised in terms of existing agricultural system, current livestock densities, and levels of poverty. The analysis provides further evidence that climate change impacts in the marginal cropping lands may be severe, where poverty rates are already high. Results also suggest that those likely to be more affected are already more poor, on average. We discuss the implications of these results in a research-for-development targeting context that is likely to see the poor disproportionately and negatively affected by climate change.

The automation and intelligence of industrial manufacturing is the core of the fourth industrial revolution, and robotic arms and proprietary networked information systems are an integral part of this vision. However, with the benefits come risks that have been overlooked, and robotic arms have become a heavily attacked area. In order to improve the security of the robotic arm system, this paper proposes an intrusion detection method based on a state classification model. The closure operation process of the robotic arm is divided into five consecutive states, while a support vector machine based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-H-SVM) classifies the operation state of the robotic arm. In the detection process, the classifier predicts the operation state of the robotic arm in real time, and the detection method determines whether the state transfer meets the logical requirements, and then determines whether the intrusion occurs. In addition, a response mechanism is proposed on the basis of the intrusion detection system to make protection measures for the robotic arm system. Finally, a physical experiment platform was built to test the intrusion detection method. The results showed that the classification accuracy of the PSO-H-SVM algorithm reached 96.02%, and the detection accuracy of the intrusion detection method reached 90%, which verified the effectiveness and reliability of the intrusion detection method.","security; robotic arm system; PSO-H-SVM; intrusion detection; physical process logic attack","","Xie, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.

Many network planning and operation procedures set forth by Independent System Operators and followed by many utilities consider the computation of the VSSM for a predefined load increase direction. Usually, this direction corresponds to increasing all loads with constant power factor and the MW generated at generation buses by using one loading factor only. However, situations may occur where small variations in this direction, as for example, an unexpected load increase at any bus or set of buses, may result in smaller VSSM, thus leading the system to an insecure operating state. The goal of this paper is to propose a combination of a fast method to estimate the VSSM with an efficient method to calculate the appropriate direction of load increase for which the margin is minimum. This information, along with the usual VSSM, can provide system operators with relevant information regarding the system's security. More complete information allow operators to take decisions like preventive control actions to move the system to a securer operating point. The procedure is divided into two main stages. The first one consists of estimating the maximum loading point (MLP) and consequently the VSSM, by using nonlinear programming techniques. The second stage consists of computing new directions of load increase. These new directions are based on eigenvector handling. Also, the use of a special load flow method with step size optimization results into a more efficient computation process. Simulation results for IEEE standard and realistic power systems are shown to evaluate the method.","power system security; voltage stability; maximum loading point (MLP); nonlinear programming; elgenanalysis","International Conference on Power Systems Technology (POWERCON), Chongqing, PEOPLES R CHINA, OCT 22-26, 2006","Bedoya, DB (Corresponding Author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Power Syst Dept, Campinas, SP, Brazil.

A ``source-storage-load'' coordinated master-slave control strategy is proposed in this study to address the aforementioned issues. The system voltage and frequency will be stable as long as the output frequency and voltage of the master resource are stable. Furthermore, it can fully utilize the power supply capacity of resources to support the supply-demand balance. The following tasks are included in the proposed strategy: 1) to improve the operational security in the face of load disruption, a source-storage-load coordinated control method based on the ``ramping speed'' ratio is proposed, which can quickly restore the balance of supply and demand; 2) to improve the communication reliability in the face of interruption, a channel planning method is proposed, which can address the communication interruption problem by constructing an internal network among source-storage-load; and 3) to improve the mode switching stability of resources subjected to external disturbance, the external disturbance suppression and stability analysis involved in the regulation process are completed using sliding-mode control and small signal model methods.

A distinction between left pectoral unipolar and bipolar pacemaker electrodes has been made here. Furthermore the different positions of a bipolar electrode were taken into consideration. It was found that depending on the position of the bipolar electrodes in a homogeneous magnetic field, major differences of induced voltage occur. The main task of this project is to ascertain the influence of electric conductivity on interference voltage in bipolar electrodes. The measurement circuit has been placed into an original pacemaker case and therefore allowed the comparison between bipolar and unipolar electrodes by only mode switching. The magnetic field has been generated by a Helmholtz coil. Part of the Helmholtz coil system was a model of a human torso filled with saline solution to simulate human tissue. The result of the measurements showed a dependency between electric conductivity and induced voltage. The extensively discussed security factor of bipolar electrodes could be calculated from the above-mentioned measurements.

Particularly important among those risks are failures to effectively address quality attribute requirements such as security, reliability, and performance. A proved efficient technique to identify and help mitigate those risks is the architecture evaluation. In this paper we propose an approach, tooling, and guidelines to aid architecture evaluation activities in REST-based systems.

With the development of large-scale generators and corresponding loss of field protection, the complicated structure leads to the high possibility of loss of field faults. According to the statistical data, more than sixty percentages of the synchronous generator faults are the excitation system faults, which might cause loss of load, tie-line tripping, instability, collapse and etc. Therefore, it is crucial to identify loss of field as early as possible and take countermeasures. In loss of field protection, the impedance boundary criterion of steady state stability limit is widely used to distinguish loss of field and normal condition. However, the steady state stability limit circle is affected by the system operating modes, which might result in mis-operation of the relay. In this paper, an approach for on-line identifying system equivalent impedance is presented based on PMU measurements. The steady state stability limit circle can be adaptively fit for operating modes.

Meanwhile, an intentional island operation of distribution systems is proposed as a potential measure against power supply outages by continuously running DG units during system emergencies. However, there are some challenging security issues for an island operation, such as the power imbalance during the islanding transition and the coordination of feeder protection systems. To tackle the former issue, which is the focus of this paper, available resources including both DG units and demand should be fully utilized as reserves. The control and coordination among different resources requires an integral architecture to serve the purpose.

With the ISR, system operators can assess beforehand if an island operation can be successful for a given distribution system at its current operating state. In case of unfavorable assessment, control measures will be suggested to coordinate different resources, aiming at pulling the system back into the ISR to ensure a successful island operation on time.

Secure remote management allows more outsourcing to third parties but leads to continuously changing factory networks. Mobile or even autonomous devices again add complexity. However, current factory owners are conservative for good reasons: changing a well-designed system is costly and may cause failures and outages of the production lines.

As a necessary extension to conventional SCOPF5, the recently proposed preventive-corrective SCOPF (PCSCOPF) aims to achieve the best coordination between the preventive control (PC) and corrective control (CC) considering the probabilistic nature of the contingencies and the cost of CC as well as other binding constraints. However, PCSCOPF renders a large-scale, multi-stage, non-linear programming problem which is difficult to directly solve. This paper proposes a novel and improved approach to the PCSCOPF problem. We aim to partition the contingencies into two exclusive sets: one is secured in the PC stage and the other in the corrective control CC stage. The PC corresponds to an ordinary SCOPF model and solved by the Benders decomposition method; the CC corresponds to an ordinary OPF model. The optimal partitioning of the contingencies is determined using an evolutionary algorithm (EA). Compared with the existing methods, the proposed approach is advantageous in that its searching dimension only depends on the number of insecure contingencies, hence tends to lead to a much higher solution speed. The proposed method is verified on the IEEE 118-bus system and compared with other two existing methods. Simulation results show that the proposed method can provide high-quality solutions with much higher computation speed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The GA is developed to find out the optimal settings of the LTCs, SVRs and SCs, including the dispatch of energy storages. The influence of the PV penetration level on voltage profile and tap movement is to be analyzed. Five scenarios are involved in this case study. In the first scenario, regulator devices are disabled and voltage profile is monitored and recorded. When the LTC is enabled in the second scenario, the voltage profile is propped up yet still below the voltage limits. The voltage is regulated within the limits, when the SVRs are enabled in the third scenario. In the fourth scenario, switching `on' the capacitor banks increases the voltage profile. This maintains the distribution system security as the voltage profile gets flattened off. Finally, the integration of the ES warrants voltage profile improvement, particularly when the voltage is low at night. The voltage deviation is substantially lowered as well from a 0.063 pu without the ES to a 0.018 pu with the ES. The proposed method is applied to the IEEE 123 test feeder, using time series analysis over a diurnal 24-h simulation period. Test results clearly show that the close coordination among the VAR control devices and energy storage scales back system energy losses and upholds voltage at customer terminals within statutory limits, under high penetration levels of solar-fueled generation.

Ensuring stable and secure operation becomes more difficult in these modern power systems. For security assessment, the results of traditional offline simulations may become obsolete prior to the completion of the assessment. In contrast, real-time stability and security assessment aims at online computation, and it is therefore dependent on very fast computation of properties of the grid operating state. The study develops the reduce-factor-solve approach to real-time computation of two key components in real-time assessment methods, network reduction, and calculation of Thevenin impedances. The aim is to allow online stability assessment for very complex networks. The theoretical foundation behind the reduce-factor-solve approach is described together with the ability to handle both algorithms in a common framework. By exploiting parallelisation of the reduce and solve steps in combination with fast matrix factorisation, Thevenin impedances and reduced networks are computed much faster than previous approaches. The reduce-factor-solve algorithm is evaluated on power grids of varying complexity to show that Thevenin impedance computation and network reduction for complex power systems can be performed on a milliseconds time scale.","distributed power generation; renewable energy sources; power system stability; power grids; matrix decomposition; power system security; network reduction; complex power systems; milliseconds time scale; fast Thevenin impedance computation; power system operation increase; power production; noncontrollable renewable energy sources; secure operation; modern power systems; security assessment; traditional offline simulations; real-time stability; online computation; grid operating state; reduce-factor-solve approach; real-time computation; real-time assessment methods; Thevenin impedances; online stability assessment; complex networks; fast matrix factorisation; reduced networks; reduce-factor-solve algorithm; power grids","","Sommer, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Comp Sci, Copenhagen, Denmark.

In this work, we simplify the privilege partitioning problem into a classification problem of RESTful functions, so the permission to call a category of functions can be granted to a specific administrator. We propose a RESTful API classification approach called RestSep based on genetic algorithm. A classification is represented as a 2-dimensional matrix, which is used as the chromosome. Customized operators of selection, mutation and crossover are designed. The fitness function is designed to balance parameters such as number of categories, test case coverage, function overlapping, etc. Experiments on popular clouds like OpenStack and Kubernetes indicate RestSep can generate a self-explanatory classification result, which can serve as a guideline for privilege partitioning. The overhead of test generation is at most 13.1% and the overhead of genetic algorithm is at most 183.29s, which are acceptable for practical use.","representational state transfer; privilege partition; genetic algorithm; integration test","24th IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS), Honolulu, HI, JUN 25-30, 2017","Wu, ZH (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.

In contrast to the research in control and small-signal rotor angle stability of microgrids, there is a significant lack of knowledge regarding the transient stability of off-grid hybrid microgrids in a cluster environment. Therefore, the large-signal rotor angle stability of pooled microgrids was assessed qualitatively and also quantitatively in this research work. Quantitative transient stability assessment (TSA) was carried out with the help of the-recently developed and validated-micro-hybrid method by combining time-domain simulations and transient energy function analyses. For this purpose, three realistic dynamic microgrids were modelled regarding three operating modes (island, interconnection, and cluster) as well as the conventional scenario ``classical'' and four hybrid scenarios (''storage'', ``sun'', ``sun & storage'', and ``night'') regarding different instants of time on a tropical partly sunny day. It can be inferred that, coupling hybrid microgrids is feasible from the voltage, frequency, and also transient stability point of view. However, the risk of large-signal rotor angle instability in pooled microgrids is relatively higher than in islanded microgrids. Along with critical clearing times, new stability-related indicators such as system stability degree and corrected critical clearing times should be taken into account in the planning phase and in the operation of microgrids. In principle, a general conclusion concerning the best operating mode and scenario of the investigated microgrids cannot be drawn. TSA of pooled hybrid microgrids should be performed-on a regular basis especially in the grid operation-for different loading conditions, tie-line power flows, topologies, operating modes, and scenarios.","critical clearing times; diesel generators; grid-feeding photovoltaics; grid-forming battery storage systems; stand-alone hybrid microgrids; system stability degree; the micro-hybrid method; transient stability assessment","","Veerashekar, K (Corresponding Author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Elect Energy Syst, Cauerstr 4,House 1, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany.

A systematic data-driven approach is proposed for detecting anomalies and analyzing the dynamics of IES vulnerability. Firstly, an anomaly detection method is introduced to determine whether there are anomalies in the system operation. The method can be set up even if the data labels for discriminating the anomalies are unknown, often the cause in practice. Secondly, a method of complex network phase theory is proposed to model information propagation among IES nodes representative of the IES physical entities. Complex network models can then be constructed to describe the system behavior in different operating conditions and over different time horizons. The degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality are used as indications to analyze changes in IES vulnerability. Finally, a method is proposed to identify the critical points of the IES from the point of view of its vulnerability. The new approach is applied to analyze the vulnerability of an IES in Spain. The results show that the proposed methods allow revealing system anomalies, vulnerability and weaknesses. Outcomes from an analysis by these methods can be used by managers to take defensive measures in advance for preventing and mitigating the impact of potential factors and threats on the IES.","Integrated energy system; Anomaly detection; Vulnerability analysis; Data-driven; Complex network theory","","Su, H; Zhang, JJ (Corresponding Author), China Univ Petr, Natl Engn Lab Pipeline Safety, MOE Key Lab Petr Engn, Beijing Key Lab Urban Oil & Gas Distribut Technol, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.

This article summarizes power grids as temporal weighted networks (TWNs) which are different from conventional temporal networks. For TWN, the topological structure is fixed but weight distribution is time varying. Then it is noted that for different operating states represented by different weight (power flow) distribution at different time sections, the risks of cascading failures would be completely different. Inspired by the analysis of intersubnetworks power shifts in cascading failures, inverse-community (IC) structure is proposed in TWN to intuitively identify the risk of cascading failures. IC describes a structure in weighted networks with several communities in which the weighted interaction between communities is significantly stronger than that within the same community. Furthermore, the conventional modularity is upgraded as inverse-modularity (IM) to quantify the characteristic of IC structure in power networks. Subsequently, considering the risk of cascading failures represented by IM and the cost of power network operation, a security/economic dispatch (SED) method is designed to handle the optimal power dispatch issues. Simulation results prove a positive correlation between IM of power flow distribution and risk of cascading failures. Furthermore, the results on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SED method in mitigating cascading failure risks.","Power system protection; Power system faults; Power grids; Load flow; Internet of Things; Load modeling; Integrated circuit modeling; Cascading failure; complex network; Internet of Things (IoT); inverse-community (IC) structure; security; economic dispatch (SED); temporal weighted network","","Xue, F (Corresponding Author), Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Suzhou 215123, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

In this connection, several novel approaches for assessing vulnerability in real time have been developed. However, most of the work is commonly focused on tackling stability phenomena, while the possible overloads are often treated as negligible in real-time power system security. But sometimes, high electric post-contingency currents might provoke overloads which could increase the system vulnerability problem. This paper presents a novel method for assessing the possibility of fast post-contingency overloads using Statistical Distribution Factors (SDFs) that allow computing an Overload Index (OVI) in real time. First, Monte Carlo-based contingency analysis is performed to iteratively calculate ac Distribution Factors (ac-DFs). After, SDFs are defined by the mean and standard deviation of ac-DFs. These SDFs are then used together with principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine classifier (SVM-C) in order to structure a table-based real-time post-contingency overload estimation algorithm, which allow computing OVIs depending on the actual operating state and the type of contingency. The proposal is tested on the IEEE New England 39-bus test system.

The security assessment of power system is being considered as an important problem in planning, operation and control. Security assessment entails that the system should remain in secure operating state under abnormal conditions. In a power system the Security assessment is carried out by using the voltage performance index (VPI) following a contingency. Contingencies are termed as the uncertain events, occurred due to line outage in the system. VPI can be used for identifying the critical contingency from the perspective of bus voltage violation limits. Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices are having a great impact on the performance of the transmission network. FACTS devices are used for controlling real and reactive power flows and regulating the bus voltages in power systems. Also, FACTS devices raises power transfer capability reduces system losses and improves system stability, because of their fast and flexible control characteristics. Owing to their huge capital cost, it is essential to place these devices optimally in a power system. In this paper, Differential Evolution (DE), a population based stochastic meta-heuristic optimization algorithm is applied for optimal placement of static var compensator (SVC) aimed to the voltage security enhancement of a power system. The SVC placement is considered to be a planning problem and is formulated as a multi-criteria problem comprising of minimization of real power loss, voltage security and investment cost of SVC under single line outage contingencies.

Approaches based on manually written rules are often fragile and require constant maintenance in this era of continuous integration. In this paper, we propose a novel ``discovery by example'' approach to autonomously search for and identify system changes. Our approach learns characteristic features of system changes automatically, without requiring any explicit rule definitions or specific knowledge of the underlying software or systems. In this approach, given a system change, our method searches a repository that contains previous stored system changes and returns those that are similar to it. We further explore the use of various forms of ``fingerprints'' to represent system changes efficiently and faithfully in a compact manner. We propose and evaluate two types of fingerprints: the ``basename fingerprint'' and the ``1-D histogram fingerprint''. We show that both fingerprints exhibit different efficiency and accuracy trade-offs, and they can be effectively employed in different use cases. We evaluate the performance of our approach with both techniques and further present an application of it in system real-time streaming monitoring.","","IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Washington, DC, OCT 27-30, 2014","Chen, H (Corresponding Author), Boston Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

However, it is not always possible, economical, or even practical from an administration and operational point of view to upgrade the software and configuration of all the nodes in a network to support such security protocols. One apparent solution to this problem is the use of security gateways that apply the relevant security protocols on behalf of the protected nodes, under the assumption that the ``last hop'' between the security gateway and the end node is safe without cryptography. Such a gateway can be set to enforce specific security policies for different types of traffic. While this solution is appealing in static scenarios (such as building so-called ``intranets''), the use of Layer-3 (network) routers as security gateways presents some transparency and configuration problems with regards to peer authentication in the automated key management protocol. This paper describes the architecture and implementation of a Layer-2 (link layer) bridge with extensions for offering Layer-3 security services. We extend the OpenBSD ethernet bridge to perform simple IP packet filtering and IPsec processing for incoming and outgoing packets on behalf of a protected node, completely transparently to both the protected and the remote communication endpoint. The same mechanism may be used to construct ``virtual local area networks,'' by establishing IPsec tunnels between OpenBSD bridges connected geographically separated LANs.

The opportunity lies in the ability of SDN applications to express intelligent and agile threat mitigation logic against hostile flows, without the need for specialized inline hardware. However, the SDN community lacks a secure control-layer to manage the interactions between the application layer and the switch infrastructure (the data plane). There are no available SDN controllers that provide the key security features, trust models, and policy mediation logic, necessary to deploy multiple SDN applications into a highly sensitive computing environment. We propose the design of security extensions at the control layer to provide the security management and arbitration of conflicting flow rules that arise when multiple applications are deployed within the same network. We present a prototype of our design as a Security Enhanced version of the widely used OpenFlow Floodlight Controller, which we call SE-Floodlight. SE-Floodlight extends Floodlight with a security-enforcement kernel (SEK) layer, whose functions are also directly applicable to other OpenFlow controllers. The SEK adds a unique set of secure application management features, including an authentication service, role-based authorization, a permission model for mediating all configuration change requests to the data-plane, inline flow-rule conflict resolution, and a security audit service. We demonstrate the robustness and scalability of our system implementation through both a comprehensive functionality assessment and a performance evaluation that illustrates its sub-linear scaling properties.","","22nd Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS), San Diego, CA, FEB 08-15, 2015","Porras, P (Corresponding Author), SRI Int, Comp Sci Lab, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA.

In this paper, we use SDN paradigm combined with machine learning to leverage the benefits of programmable flow-based telemetry with flexible data-driven models to manage IoT devices based on their network activity. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We analyze traffic traces of 17 real consumer IoT devices collected in our lab over a six-month period and identify a set of traffic flows (per-device) whose time-series attributes computed at multiple timescales (from a minute to an hour) characterize the network behavior of various IoT device types, and their operating states (i.e., booting, actively interacted with user, or being idle); (2) We develop a multi-stage architecture of inference models that use flow-level attributes to automatically distinguish IoT devices from non-IoTs, classify individual types of IoT devices, and identify their states during normal operations. We train our models and validate their efficacy using real traffic traces; and (3) We quantify the trade-off between performance and cost of our solution, and demonstrate how our monitoring scheme can be used in operation for detecting behavioral changes (firmware upgrade or cyber attacks).","IoT; device monitoring; flow characteristics; machine learning","","Sivanathan, A (Corresponding Author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Elect Engn & Telecommun, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.

The results and their correlation analysis between the experimental data and the computational models are given. By using finite element simulations, the computational results of the modes with the first 12 orders for the automobile seat are in the range 0-100 Hz, including the integral modes and the local modes of the automobile seat. An experimental method was designed to measure the seat frame mode using an impact hammer, a triaxial accelerometer, uniaxial accelerometers and a 24-channel LMS vibration test system. The experimental data were analysed by estimating the frequency response function and the modal parameters and validated using LMS Test.Lab software. The experimental results for five integral modal parameters of the automobile seat between 0 Hz and 100 Hz are given. The orthogonal experimental method is used to design nine different working states of the automobile seat with variations in the positions of different adjustable devices (the headrest, the height adjuster, the recliner and the track slide).

However, simultaneous failure of more than one device is more dangerous and might result in cascading failures. Due to cyber-attacks and malicious motivations, attacking several components of the system is more probable. Various methods have been proposed for contingency screening, which are mainly time-consuming and cannot be applied to real systems. On the other hand, there is no integrated algorithm for screening N-1, N-k, and N-1-1 contingencies. In this paper, an indirect method has been presented for this purpose. The proposed method extracts different critical contingencies through screening contingencies in offline mode for some selected operating modes. Then, they are clustered using the Gaussian-mixture model using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Therefore, the boundary between data is specified, which helps to find the closest (the most similar) operating modes. In online mode, the critical contingencies of the closest trained data are introduced as the critical contingency set of the present operating point. To the best of our knowledge, this study employs the correlation between the loads and generators in contingency screening for the first time. The proposed method outperforms the existing methods in terms of simplicity, accuracy, and speed such that it detects contingencies with the maximum accuracy of 100% without imposing any additional computational load.","Contingency Analysis; Contingency Screening; Static Security; Clustering; PCA; Gaussian-mixture model","","Hagh, MT (Corresponding Author), Univ Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.

We develop a formal model of Open Flow networks, and prove that consistent updates preserve a large class of properties.

In this paper, we develop an RBAC administrative model to manage authorization assignments in the EGRBAC (enhanced generalized role-based access control) operational model for smart home IoT. We design the administrative model based on pairwise disjoint Administrative Units, each of which contains a uniquely assigned administrative role and a set of administrative tasks. Administrative tasks determine the administrative permissions available to manage the operational model assignments. We begin with a model containing a single administrative unit and then extend it to include additional units. Multiple administrative units enable decentralized administration which could be adapted to provide scalability in inherently distributed and large-scale environments beyond smart home, such as smart buildings or smart campuses. We provide formalism of our proposed model and illustrate it by specifying operational and administrative use cases.

However, the different physical characteristics and complex coupling of different energy sources have deeply troubled researchers. With the rapid development of AI and big data, some attempts to apply data-driven methods to IES have been made. Data-driven technologies aim to abandon complex IES modeling, instead mining the mapping relationships between different parameters based on massive volumes of operating data. However, integrated energy system construction is still in the initial stage of development and operational data are difficult to obtain, or the operational scenarios contained in the data are not enough to support data-driven technologies. In this paper, we first propose an IES operating scenario generator, based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), to produce high quality IES operational data, including energy price, load, and generator output. We estimate the quality of the generated data, in both visual and quantitative aspects. Secondly, we propose a control strategy based on the Q-learning algorithm for a renewable energy and storage system with high uncertainty. The agent can accurately map between the control strategy and the operating states.

However, identification of suitable locations, where the effect of these FACTs devices will be most beneficial to the network, has been a growing concern to electric power utilities in planning and operation of power systems. Consequently, a safe and reliable power system operation requires that all operating states, which could be used to enhance power system operation such as voltage profile enhancement and loss reduction, must be quickly detected and identified. This paper, therefore, introduces a Line Strength Index (LSI) for identifying suitable locations where reactive power supports such as Thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) could be located for voltage profile enhancement and transmission loss reduction within the system. Furthermore, the influence of TCSC placement on the voltage profile and transmission losses is investigated. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a simple 6-bus power network. The results obtained are compared with that obtained when TCSC is placed at a randomly selected location. This shows that the integrity of a stressed power network, in terms of security and reliability, could be easily enhanced through the application of TCSC whose placement is determined by LSI, a non-iterative-based approach.","voltage profile; transmission loss; thyristor-controlled series capacitor; coupling strength matrix; line strength index","1st International Conference on Computational Techniques, Electronics and Mechanical Systems (CTEMS), KLS Gote Inst Technol, Belagavi, INDIA, DEC 21-23, 2018","Alayande, AS (Corresponding Author), Univ Johannesburg, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Elect Engn & Elect Engn Sci, Johannesburg, South Africa.

Representational state transfer (REST) is an architectural style that has attracted attention in the SOA domain as it allows the development of Web services based on original principles of the World Wide Web. Unlike Web service specifications, which are based on Simple Object Access Protocol and Web Services Description Language, REST does not provide official' standards to address non-functional requirements of services, such as security, reliability, and transaction control. The timestamp-based two-phase commit protocol for RESTful service (TS2PC4RS) algorithm specifies concurrency control of RESTful services during a transaction. An extension of the TS2PC4RS specifies the concurrency control of the Web services considering the update operation to meet some business rules. However, neither algorithm addresses transaction control when failures occur. In long-term transactions, failures can occur and compromise the success of Web service applications. Two common failures traditionally considered in the analysis of protocols are host and connection failures. The aim of this paper is to address fault tolerance for TS2PC4RS and its extension. A fault-tolerant protocol based on timeout and log records is proposed. The fault-tolerant protocol provides support for the host and connection failures that may occur during a transaction execution. The fault-tolerant mechanisms are used to meet the application domain business rules that guide the behavior of RESTful services. We describe the protocol using scenarios when failures occur.

An assessment question-driven approach was layered on top of standard penetration assessment methods. Test cases were planned around the questions and a sample set of vendor products typically used in the oil and gas sector. Four systems were composed from different product subsets and were assessed using the test cases. We analyzed results from the four assessments to illuminate issues that existed regardless of system composition. Analysis revealed recurring vulnerabilities that exist in all safety systems due to issues in the design of safety instruments and the HART protocol. We found that device-native hardware write-protections provide the best defense, followed by SIS write protections. We concluded that, when using SIS security controls, an SIS-mediated system can protect against unauthorized device reconfigurations better than can a MUX-based system. When SIS security controls are not used, there is no added security benefit. We present lessons learned for ICS stakeholders and for people who are interested in conducting this kind of evaluation.","Industrial control system; safety instrumented system; safety instruments; asset management; countermeasures; security controls; HART; cyberattack; assessment methodology","14th Workshop on Cyber Security Experimentation and Test (CSET), ELECTR NETWORK, AUG09, 2021","Tinnel, LS (Corresponding Author), SRI Int, Arlington, VA 22209 USA.

The goal of the proposed framework is to construct a safe, flexible, and manageable system containing multi-agent, auto-notice, sensor management, and secure transmission of data to allow an autonomous functioning of RPM. Methods: The literature between 2002 and 2018 that introduces healthcare platforms with the technology of the Internet of things (IoT) is reviewed and compared in compliance with various technical and functional features. Eleven healthcare-based IoT platforms are compared. Eight of them utilize the Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API), while ten of them have Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), seven of them have device management, and nine of them have security control. In addition, Kepware's KEPServerEX communication platform containing up to 250 communication protocols is included. Results: The results confirm that the proposed framework reliably operates within the complex healthcare processes, taking into account the equipment management, security management, messaging and diversification of communication protocols. This study uses the concept of IoT 3-tier through which a complete sensor management mechanism is structured. Moreover, secure data connection protects the patient's privacy. Each sensor provides a distinctive notification to construct flawless authority management. Conclusions: The proposed framework can not only reach the machine-to-machine (M2M) realm, but also provide support in emergency cases. (C) 2019 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine.

Users can employ the same interface to invoke various applications from the Internet. For security purposes, service providers would control the access to the provided interface through policy enforcement. Yet the access control of REST interfaces lacks a uniform standard regarding the policy language and corresponding enforcement implementation, which brings two limitations: i) Users have to deal with totally different types of policies to accommodate certain systems. ii) Service providers have to design their own platform-specific authorization policy language and the related enforcement mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a REST Policy Language (RestPL) to express the authorization policies especially for REST APIs. RestPL is ensured to be request-oriented, based on our definition of the standard request form. This indicates that a RestPL policy can be automatically generated from an actual request, which helps mitigate a user's pressure during policy designing. Furthermore, we also provide a reference implementation for the enforcement code of RestPL based on regular expressions and deploy it on OpenStack Liberty to demonstrate its feasibility. The experimental results indicate the enforcement overhead of RestPL can be reduced to 80.6% compared with the original policy. In addition, we show that an end-user can also benefit from RestPL for reducing the learning effort by at least 41.6%.","representational state transfer; access control; security policy; request-oriented","IEEE 23rd International Conference on Web Services (ICWS), San Francisco, CA, JUN 27-JUL 02, 2016","Wu, ZH (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Machine learning techniques are posing an increasingly important role in the field of malware identification and analysis. However, due to the complexity of the problem, the training of intelligent systems proves to be insufficient in recognizing advanced cyberthreats. The biggest challenge in information systems security using machine learning methods is to understand the polymorphism and metamorphism mechanisms used by malware developers and how to effectively address them. This work presents an innovative Artificial Evolutionary Fuzzy LSTM Immune System which, by using a heuristic machine learning method that combines evolutionary intelligence, Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and fuzzy knowledge, proves to be able to adequately protect modern information system from Portable Executable Malware. The main innovation in the technical implementation of the proposed approach is the fact that the machine learning system can only be trained from raw bytes of an executable file to determine if the file is malicious. The performance of the proposed system was tested on a sophisticated dataset of high complexity, which emerged after extensive research on PE malware that offered us a realistic representation of their operating states. The high accuracy of the developed model significantly supports the validity of the proposed method. The final evaluation was carried out with in-depth comparisons to corresponding machine learning algorithms and it has revealed the superiority of the proposed immune system.","","","Jiang, J (Corresponding Author), Hunan Arts & Sci Univ, Coll Comp & Elect Engn, Changde 415000, Peoples R China.

This can result in a system being left insecure because of the lack of easily accessible experience and specialist resources. While performing security tasks, human experts often revert to a system's event logs to establish security information (configuration changes, errors, etc.). However, finding and exploiting knowledge from event logs is a challenging and time-consuming task for non-experts. Hence there is a strong need to provide mechanisms to make the process easier for security experts, as well as providing tools for those with significantly less security expertise. In this paper, we present a novel technique to process security event logs of a system that have been evaluated and configured by a security expert, extract key domain knowledge indicative of human decision making, and automatically apply acquired knowledge to previously unseen systems by non-experts to propose security improvements. The proposed solution utilises rule mining algorithms to extract security actions from event log entries. The set of identified rules is represented as a domain action model. The domain model and problem instance generated from a previously unseen system can then be used to produce a plan-of-action, which can be exploited by non-professionals to improve their system's security. Empirical analysis is subsequently performed on 21 event logs, where the acquired domain model and identified plans are discussed in terms of accuracy and performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To examine whether a power system can remain in a secure and reliable operating state under contingency conditions, those contingency cases that will result in loss-of-load, loss-of-generation, or islanding are first identified. Then IP-IQ iteration of fast decoupled load flow is performed to estimate post-contingent quantities (line flows, bus voltages) for other contingency cases. Bawd on system operators' past experience, each post-contingent quantity is assigned a degree of severity according to the potential damage that could be imposed on the power system by the quantity, should the contingency occurs. Since human experts tend to use linguistic variables to describe the degree of severity, uncertainty or imprecision exists in knowledge representation. An approach bawd on fuzzy wt theory is developed to deal with the imprecision of linguistic terms With the degree of severity for each quantity in a contingency caw described by a fuzzy set, a set of fuzzy reasoning procedures are developed to generate the overall degree of severity for each contingency case. Those contingency cases with high degree of severity are provided to system operators for further examination in order to decide whether appropriate actions should be taken. Since the operators' heuristic rules are taken into account in the reasoning procedure, it is expected that those contingency cases, which are potentially harmful to the system bawd on previous experience, will be picked out by the proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by contingency ranking of Taiwan power system which consists of 170 buses, 121 lines, and 86 transformers.","SECURITY ASSESSMENT; FUZZY SET THEORY","","HSU, YY (Corresponding Author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DEPT ELECT ENGN,TAIPEI,TAIWAN.

The share in volatile energy sources connected through power electronic components increases, whereas the installed power of grid-connected generators and associated inertia decreases. In this context, critical operating states up to system blackouts, that threaten the security of supply and the access to electical energy, might occur. In order to restore the grid after a blackout in an efficient way, this paper proposes an advanced control concept for high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems using voltage source converters (VSC) in gridforming mode. VSC-HVDC systems open new restoration paths and offer the possibility to involve healthy grid areas form a far distance to take part in the restoration process. To benefit from the potential of renewable energy sources and energy storage devices to support the process, established restoration strategies are extended by the consistent integration of power electronics and intelligent control schemes. The presented model predictive controller (MPC) enables precise voltage reference tracking inside the restoration area to ensure a grid compatible voltage ramp-up process by avoiding undesireable effects, e. g. inrush phenomena of transformers. Moreover, the grid frequency is used as a system-wide parameter that is used as a physical information channel between the grid-forming VSC-HVDC station and further power converters inside the restoration area. In that way, renewable energy sources and storage devices can contribute to speed up the restoration process while guaranteeing system stability.","``Predictive control''; ``Grid-forming''; ``HVDC transmission''; ``Grid restoration''; ``Predictive reference tracking''; ``Dynamic frequency adaption''","20th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications (EPE ECCE Europe), Riga, LATVIA, SEP 17-21, 2018","Mahr, F (Corresponding Author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg FAU, Chair Elect Energy Syst, Cauerstr 4,Haus 1, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany.

Photoswitching between the colorless and colored isomers (P1: o-BTFO4 c-BTFO4, P2: o-DTE c-DTE, P3: SP MC) enables the P1 + P2 and P1 + P3 films to be cycled through three distinct states. From the initial state (o-BTFO4 + o-DTE/SP), irradiation with UV light generates the second state (c-BTFO4 + c-DTE/MC), where c-BTFO4 -> c-DTE/MC energy transfer is established. Irradiation with green light then generates the third state (c-BTFO4 + o-DTE/SP), where the energy transfer acceptor is no longer present. Finally, irradiation with blue light regenerates the initial state. For the P1 + P2 film, only one state is fluorescent, with the irradiation inputs required to be entered in the correct order to access this state, acting as a keypad lock. For the P1 + P3 film, the states emit either no fluorescence, red fluorescence, or green fluorescence, all using a common excitation wavelength. Additionally, once the fluorescence is activated with UV light, it undergoes a time-dependent color transition from red to green, due to the pairing of P-type and T-type photochromes.

Increasing human-animal interactions are perceived as driving factors in pathogen transfer, emphasising the close relationships between human, animal and environmental health. Contemporary livelihood and market patterns tend to degrade ecosystems and their services, driving a cycle of degradation in increasingly tightly linked socio-ecological systems. This contributes to reductions in the natural regulating capacities of ecosystem services to limit disease transfer from animals to humans. It also undermines natural resource availability, compromising measures such as washing and sanitation that may be key to managing subsequent human-to-human disease transmission. Human activities driving this degrading cycle tend to convert beneficial ecosystem services into disservices, exacerbating risks related to zoonotic diseases. Conversely, measures to protect or restore ecosystems constitute investment in foundational capital, enhancing their capacities to provide for greater human security and opportunity. We use the DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State change-Impact-Response) framework to explore three aspects of zoonotic diseases: (1) the significance of disease regulation ecosystem services and their degradation in the emergence of Covid-19 and other zoonotic diseases; and of the protection of natural resources as mitigating contributions to both (2) regulating human-to-human disease transfer; and (3) treatment of disease outbreaks. From this analysis, we identify a set of appropriate response options, recognising the foundational roles of ecosystems and the services they provide in risk management. Zoonotic disease risks are ultimately interlinked with biodiversity crises and water insecurity. The need to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic ongoing at the time of writing creates an opportunity for systemic policy change, placing scientific knowledge of the value and services of ecosystems at the heart of societal concerns as a key foundation for a more secure future. Rapid political responses and unprecedented economic stimuli reacting to the pandemic demonstrate that systemic change is achievable at scale and pace, and is also therefore transferrable to other existential, global-scale threats including climate change and the `biodiversity crisis'. This also highlights the need for concerted global action, and is also consistent with the duties, and ultimately the self-interests, of developed, donor nations.","Zoonotic diseases; Ecosystem services; Water security; DPSIR; Socio-Ecological systems; Regeneration","","Everard, M (Corresponding Author), Univ West England UWE, Coldharbour Lane,Frenchay Campus, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.

TeraSCREEN proposes to develop an innovative concept of multi-frequency multi-mode Terahertz and millimeter-wave detection with new automatic detection and classification functionalities. The system developed will demonstrate, at a live control point, the safe automatic detection and classification of objects concealed under clothing, whilst respecting privacy and increasing current throughput rates. This innovative screening system will combine multi-frequency, multi-mode images taken by passive and active subsystems which will scan the subjects and obtain complementary spatial and spectral information, thus allowing for automatic threat recognition.

Subsequently, the vibration transmission of the specimen with different deformations is tested. The commercial software COMSOL is used to simulate finite-element dynamic models of the unit cell, and the entire structures of the meta -material is established to analyze their bandgaps and frequency response characteristics. Both the numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the configuration change can significantly affect the bandgap characteristics. With increasing compression, the existing low-frequency bandwidth of the metamaterial narrow, whereas the high-frequency bandwidth broadens. When the metamaterial deformation is larger, a new bandgap appears at a lower frequency. In addition, the effects of the geometric parameters on the bandgaps are revealed. It shows that the frequency range, width and number of bandgaps of the developed metamaterial can be effectively adjusted through configuration control.","Configuration-controllablemetamaterial; Bandgapcharacteristics; Vibrationreduction","","Bai, CQ (Corresponding Author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, State Key Lab Strength & Vibrat Mech Struct, Shaanxi Key Lab Environm & Control Flight Vehicle, 28 Xianning West Rd, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.

There may be many Internet protocols for service access standards that are used to ensure interoperability between users browser and Web server, such as Representational State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Each service has its specific characteristics such as authentication and security requirements. Hence, Cloud providers attempt to lock customers into proprietary interfaces so consumers can find themselves at not expects inevitable vendor lock-in. Therefore, the focus of our paper is to propose a solution to this problem by using Cloud intermediate between Cloud providers and consumer in heterogeneous Cloud environments interfaces. This is to achieve benefits such as standardization and interoperability, minimizing lock-in of Cloud providers. To reach such benefits, we propose a Cloud SaaS based on two interfaces and an interne component. These interfaces are used in Cloud Consumer and Provider sides and therefore guarantee communication between Cloud Consumer and Provider using different Internet protocols for Web service access such as REST and SOAP.

Graphical security models (e.g., Attack Graphs and Attack Trees) are widely used to systematically analyse the security posture of network systems using security metrics. However, there are problems using them to assess the security of dynamic networks. First, most models are unable to capture dynamic changes occurring in the networks over time. Second, the existing security metrics are not designed for the analysis of dynamic networks and hence their effectiveness to the dynamic changes in the network still remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically categorise network changes into two categories (i.e., changes in hosts and changes in edges). We conduct a comprehensive analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of security metrics using a Temporal Hierarchical Attack Representation Model, which can capture and analyse the changes in the security of network systems. Further, we investigate the varying effects of security metrics when changes are observed in the dynamic networks. Our simulation results show that different security metrics (except the shortest attack path) have varying security posture changes with respect to changes in the network (when we introduce time to them). However, none of the security metrics consistently changes for all the network changes that we observe in our scenarios. Hence, the results provide some insights into what security metrics can change (accordingly) when a particular network change is observed. It also provides a foundation for further research in this area. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

While they are known at irregular times, system modeling and grid state estimation are of the highest importance to ensure secure operations. This paper proposes a richer method to estimate the grid state over its reference configurations based on the temporal evolution of its breakers' states. The first contribution consists in developing a general multi-observation continuous-time finite-state Hidden Markov Model with filter-based parameter estimation to infer the hidden state (e.g., the grid reference configuration) handling multiple observed processes with irregular `'jump''times (e.g., the breakers' states). As a second contribution, we build a numerical scheme with no discretization error adapted to all state jumps generated by the observed processes. Finally, we apply our model to simulated and real data to illustrate the approach's performance. The available data consists of historical records of breakers' states during the electrical transmission grid operated normally. For this real-data-driven application, we also present a clustering approach to identify the set of grid reference configurations. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

A recursive sampling method is introduced in the proposed Monte Carlo-based framework for generating scenarios, in which the effects of component aging and covariates on the outage process are quantified by the proportional hazard model (PHM). For each sampled scenario, an iterative dynamic scenario updating approach is introduced to consider interactions among covariate conditions, random component outages, and maintenance outage scheduling. The co-optimization problem is decoupled into three separate optimization subproblems by Lagrangian relaxation (LR), which include generation maintenance scheduling, transmission maintenance scheduling, and short-term SCUC problems. Each scenario is dynamically updated based on the optimal maintenance outage and SCUC solutions, and maintenance and SCUC solutions are re-optimized using the updated scenario. The iterative procedure stops when neither the optimal schedule nor the dynamic scenario changes any further. The overall convergence of the proposed Monte Carlo-based framework is checked by the coefficient of variation (CV) of costs over multiple scenarios. Case studies on the 6-bus system and the IEEE 118-bus system are used to exhibit the effectiveness of proposed framework.","Covariates; maintenance outage scheduling; Monte Carlo simulation; proportional hazard model; security-constrained unit commitment; severe weather","","Wang, YF (Corresponding Author), Zhejiang Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

They do so by monitoring and analysing this environment, and deploying security functions that satisfy some protection (security, privacy, or forensic) requirements. In this paper, we suggest that a key characteristic for engineering adaptive security is the topology of the operational environment, which represents a physical and/or a digital space - including its structural relationships, such as containment, proximity, and reachability. For adaptive security, topology expresses a rich representation of context that can provide a system with both structural and semantic awareness of important contextual characteristics. These include the location of assets being protected or the proximity of potentially threatening agents that might harm them. Security-related actions, such as the physical movement of an actor from a room to another in a building, may be viewed as topological changes. The detection of a possible undesired topological change (such as an actor possessing a safe's key entering the room where the safe is located) may lead to the decision to deploy a particular security control to protect the relevant asset. This position paper advocates topology awareness for more effective engineering of adaptive security. By monitoring changes in topology at runtime one can identify new or changing threats and attacks, and deploy adequate security controls accordingly. The paper elaborates on the notion of topology and provides a vision and research agenda on its role for systematically engineering adaptive security systems.","Topology; adaptation; security; privacy; digital forensics","9th International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS), Hyderabad, INDIA, JUN 02-03, 2014","Pasquale, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Limerick, Lero Irish Software Engn Res Ctr, Castletroy, Co Limerick, Ireland.

Since a pre-described formation strategy is unable to adapt to a complex and dynamic environment, an optimization-based approach is proposed to transfer the formation tracking problem into a time-varying optimization one, subject to some constraints with several time-varying parameters which determine the rule of formation configuration change adaptively. These parameters are computed by a centralized unit and allocated to each agent as a global mission. Furthermore, each agent cooperates with others to execute this mission under a distributed optimization-based strategy, which combines a geometric center observer technology and a novel double parameter projections technology. The former ensures accurate tracking of a continuous reference trajectory. The latter guarantees that all agents enter into a time-varying security region and never escape from it, and meanwhile, all agents are attracted towards the best time-varying formation configuration via a gradient descent with a compensation. Finally, some simulation results are illustrated to verify the effectiveness of the strategy. (c) 2022 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, existing FDIA detection methods usually only focus on the detection feature extraction between false data and normal data, ignoring the feature correlation that easily produces diverse data redundancy, resulting in the significant difficulty of detecting false-data-injection attacks. To address the above problem, we propose a multi-source self-attention data fusion model for designing an efficient FDIA detection method. The proposed data fusing model firstly employs a temporal alignment technique to integrate the collected multi-source sensing data to the identical time dimension. Subsequently, a symmetric hybrid deep network model is built by symmetrically combining long short-term memory (LSTM) and a convolution neural network (CNN), which can effectively extract hybrid features for different multi-source sensing data. Furthermore, we design a self-attention module to further eliminate hybrid feature redundancy and aggregate the differences between attack-data features and normal-data features. Finally, the extracted features and their weights are integrated to implement false-data-injection attack detection using a single convolution operation. Extensive simulations are performed over IEEE14 node test systems and IEEE118 node test systems; the experimental results demonstrate that our model can achieve better data fusion effects and presents a superior detection performance compared with the state-of-the-art.","data fusion; deep learning; FDIA; power cyber physical system; self-attention","","Li, FY (Corresponding Author), Shanghai Univ Elect Power, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.

The goal of the SMM is to perform system management functions, such as hardware control and power management. Because of this, SMM has powerful resources. Moreover, its executive software executes unnoticed by any other component in the system, including operating systems and hypervisors. For that reason, SMM has been exploited in the past to facilitate attacks, misuse, or alternatively, building security tools capitalising on its resources. In this paper, we discuss how the use of the SMM has been contributing to the arms race between system's attackers and defenders. We analyse the main work published on attacks, misuse and implementing security tools in the SMM and how the SMM has been modified to respond to those issues.

Providing a holistic security assessment for networks consisting of several hundreds hosts is hardly feasible though without some sort of mechanization. Mitigation, prioritizing counter-measures subject to a given budget, currently lacks a solid theoretical understanding and is hence more art than science. In this work, we propose the first approach for conducting comprehensive what-if analyses in order to reason about mitigation in a conceptually well-founded manner. To evaluate and compare mitigation strategies, we use simulated penetration testing, i.e., automated attack-finding, based on a network model to which a subset of a given set of mitigation actions, e.g., changes to the network topology, system updates, configuration changes etc. is applied. Using Stackelberg planning, we determine optimal combinations that minimize the maximal attacker success (similar to a Stackelberg game), and thus provide a well-founded basis for a holistic mitigation strategy. We show that these Stackelberg planning models can largely be derived from network scan, public vulnerability databases and manual inspection with various degrees of automation and detail, and we simulate mitigation analysis on networks of different size and vulnerability.","Planning; network security; simulated penetration testing","34th ACM/SIGAPP Annual International Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC), Univ Cyprus, Limassol, CYPRUS, APR 08-12, 2019","Speicher, P (Corresponding Author), CISPA Helmholtz Ctr, Saarbrucken, Germany.

A large number of applications relate to cellular and mobile telephony, pagers, local area networks, cordless phones, global positioning systems, and security systems. Pseudo-SAW (PSAW) and more recently the High Velocity Pseudo-SAW (HVPSAW) have received a great deal of attention due to their high phase velocities, and therefore the high frequencies of operation these modes may provide. In addition to high phase velocities, the pseudo-modes must also present low propagation losses and considerably high electromechanical coupling coefficients to be considered for practical devices. This paper verifies that the metallic layer thickness is a relevant SAW device parameter in order to achieve lower losses, for high frequency, high electromechanical coupling, low loss SAW devices. Popular PSAW and HVPSAW material orientations such as 64 degrees YX LiNbO3 (0 degrees-26 degrees 0 degrees), 36 degrees YX LiTaO3 (0 degrees-54 degrees 0 degrees), LiNbO3 (90 degrees 90 degrees 36 degrees), LiTaO3 (90 degrees 90 degrees 31 degrees), Quartz ST-X (0 degrees 132.75 degrees 0 degrees), Li2B4O7 (0 degrees 45 degrees 90 degrees), among others, are considered. In addition to the lower losses and the dispersion analysis for the pseudo modes, the present work discusses the transitions with layer thickness from HVPSAWs to higher order PSAWs modes, and the transitions from PSAWs to the generalized SAWs (GSAWs) modes. Besides contributing to the knowledge of the pseudo-modes behavior with layer thickness, this mode transition analysis enlightens the situation where the losses in the pseudo modes go to zero, due to the merging of the pseudo modes into the GSAWs. The fact that as a function of thickness the GSAWs are a natural continuation for the pseudo modes may be conveniently used in the fabrication of low loss devices. For completeness the effects of heavy layer metals, such as gold, in reducing the layer thickness where the pseudo modes merge to the GSAWs are discussed.

Supported by big data and cloud computing, bulk power grid security defense system was divided into two parts: one is the prevention and control of operation risks. Power grid risks are eliminated and influence of random faults is reduced through measures such as network planning, power-cut scheme, risk pre-warning, equipment status monitoring, voltage control, frequency control and adjustment of operating mode. The other is the fault recovery control..

A joint reserve scheduling model considering the cross-sectorial impacts of operation uncertainties is essential but still insufficient to guarantee the reliable operation of the integrated electricity and natural gas system (IEGS). Therefore, this paper proposes a day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model for the IEGS to schedule the operation and reserve simultaneously considering reliability requirements. Firstly, the multi-state models for generating units and gas wells are established. Based on the multi-state models, the expected unserved energy cost (EUEC) and the expected wind curtailment cost (EWC) criteria are proposed based on probabilistic methods considering wind fluctuation and random failures of components in IEGS. Furthermore, the EUEC and EWC criteria are incorporated into the day-ahead SCUC model, which is nonconvex and mathematically reformulated into a solvable mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) problem. The proposed model is validated using an IEEE 30-bus system and Belgium 20-node natural gas system. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively schedule the energy reserve to guarantee the reliable operation of the IEGS considering the multiple uncertainties in different subsystems and the cross-sectorial failure propagation.","Integrated electricity and natural gas system (IEGS); natural gas reserve; electric reserve; expected unserved energy cost; expected wind curtailment; multi-state model; operational reliability","","Ding, Y (Corresponding Author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Elect Engn, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.

Recently, orbital angular momentum (OAM) technology has attracted widespread attention due to its potential of improving capacity and spectrum efficiency. However, there are few researches on system security based on OAM technology. In this work, we studied the security of the proposed OAM wiretap system by applying physical layer security theory to OAM communications. Firstly, we proposed a uniform circular array-based multi-mode OAM system and derived the secrecy capacity. Secondly, the phase profiles, channel capacity and received power of OAM beams are analyzed in terms of various system parameters in oblique scenarios at 30GHz. Thirdly, we discussed the security of the proposed OAM wiretap system. The results show that the system using vortex waves is superior to conventional communication systems using planar electromagnetic waves in terms of system security due to the inherent divergence and spiral phase structure of OAM beams. Moreover, we found that the distortion of OAM beams during transmission and the center shift at receiving end will occur and that system is more stable for high-mode OAM propagation in oblique scenarios. This work can provide an effective guidance for the research and application of OAM communications.","Security; Antenna arrays; Transmitting antennas; Receiving antennas; Orbits; Wireless communication; physical layer security; orbital angular momentum; secrecy capacity; uniform circular array; multiplexing and demultiplexing","","Liao, X; Wang, Y (Corresponding Author), Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Commun & Informat Engn, Chongqing Key Lab Mobile Communicat Technol, Engn Res Ctr Mobile Commun,Minist Educ, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China.

A key challenge in this regard is that SDN configurations interact with network devices that can behave in unexpected ways, depending on factors such as traffic and application mix. In this paper, we describe OFf, a debugging and test environment for SDN developers. OFf is built on top of the fs-sdn simulator, which was developed to offer simple-to-use, accurate and scalable evaluation of OpenFlow-based SDN configurations. OFf offers standard debugging features for controller applications such as stepping, breakpoints, and watch variables. It also offers features that provide visibility into network behavior including packet tracing, packet replay and visualization features, and alerts that are triggered when, e.g., configurations change. OFf is accessed through a text interface and is designed to interoperate with any standard SDN controller platform. We demonstrate the capabilities of OFf through three test scenarios that illustrate its utility and modest performance impact on running applications. Specifically, we show how OFf can be used to analyze and fix bugs in a traffic engineering application, and to detect and repair a security vulnerability due to multiple application interaction and unexpected rule expiration.","Debugging; OpenFlow; Simulation; Software-Defined Networks","10th ACM International Conference on Emerging Networking Experiments and Technologies (ACM CoNEXT), Sydney, AUSTRALIA, DEC 02-05, 2014","Durairajan, R (Corresponding Author), Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

In theory, there are two main objectives that could be considered, namely the maximization of system security and the minimization of total operating cost of supplying energy. In practice, however, the security requirements are included as constraints rather than formulating the problem as a security maximization mandate. The system security constraints are in fact boundaries that surround all possible operating modes (scenarios) of the power system. In other words, these boundaries form the feasible operating domain - in the parameter space spanned by various operating variables - within which the system can safely be operated. For a given operating scenario, the associated security level is measured by the ``distance'' (for example, the Euclidean norm) of the operating point from the security region boundary. This paper presents a novel framework for identification and representation of operating security regions in power systems as well as evaluation of security levels associated with different operating scenarios. While the concepts and principles presented are general, the work of this the paper is confined to the interpretation of the security boundary in terms of system stability criteria. Of course, the framework presented is applicable quite as well to other criteria that may be considered.","Power system operation; Security regions; System stability; Operating constraints","3rd International Conference on Network and System Security, Surfers Paradise, AUSTRALIA, OCT 19-21, 2009","El-Kady, MA (Corresponding Author), King Saud Univ, CoEIA, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.

This interconnectivity enables new functionality but also new attack vectors. Today, agencies mostly rely on commercial security solutions providing adequate protection for commercial data services but have deficiencies when it comes to the Air Traffic Management (ATM) environment with its requirement for highest resilience, multi-level redundancies, and dynamic environment. This paper introduces a novel approach to create an ATM-grade baseline integrating operational security events (OSE) and alerts (OSA) based on abnormal or malicious network traffic. An assured and trusted baseline is key to detecting atypical or malicious traffic. A testbed has been developed that models the regular ATM-grade IP-network behavior. The sample configuration uses open source stacks ElastiFlow, and SELKS to provide network flow data collection and visualization and demonstrate resilience against hacking attempts via unauthorized communication and protocols between nodes, unauthorized configuration changes via distribution of parameters to network nodes, as well as detection of malicious communication attempts from unauthorized devices on the network. A Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture is chosen as it features a programmable, efficient network configuration improving network performance and monitoring. The OpenFlow protocol is used to provide the control plane in the testbed. Data flows will be modeled as synchronous as well as asynchronous. Vulnerabilities are then identified, attack scenarios defined and applied to the testbed setup. The available SDN platform tools are then used to detect the anomalies. Sets of experiments are performed and the results compared and discussed.","","Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS), ELECTR NETWORK, APR 20-22, 2021","Lellek, P (Corresponding Author), Frequentis AG, Vienna, Austria.

The suggested risk model focuses on a given train location to estimate likelihood of the PTC system failing by considering environmental risk factors (precipitation, vegetation, obstacles) and the inherent vulnerability of the radio frequency yielding a measure of system impact. For the same location, the risk model considers safety related attributes such as train speed, track curvature, freight type, etc. offering an estimate of operational consequence if there were an accident due to the failure of PTC. It is this intersection of impact / consequence that separates the proposed model from existing risk calculations of impact / likelihood. This is accomplished by distinguishing the likelihood of a safety accident from the likelihood of a PTC system failure and incorporating them both. What results is an enhancement of both models; the operational risk model factors potential PTC failure in its risk assessment and gains awareness of possible requirements for operator intervention while the system risk model factors operational risk as its severity metric leading to possible requirements for automated risk mitigation by dynamic configuration change to the PTC radio.","","ASME 2014 Joint Rail Conference, Colorado Springs, CO, APR 02-04, 2014","Abadie, A (Corresponding Author), George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.

A novel hybrid model is first founded to clearly explain the interactive hybrid behaviors of the power systems during significant disturbances. On the basis of the model, the hybrid control is proposed, which consists of upper level control strategies (including logic control commands for discrete events and energy management strategies) and lower level continuous controls for component units. The upper level control strategies are responsible for switching operating modes for the purpose of security operation following a significant disturbance, as well as power assignment for the economical efficiency of operation, and the lower level continuous controllers are responsible for regulating dynamic stability of the systems. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid control is demonstrated through simulation examples.","Continuous controllers; energy management; hybrid control; logic control strategies; smart gird","","Dou, CX (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, State Key Lab Turbulence & Complex Syst, Coll Engn, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.

The PKC-based security protocols are more energy-efficient because they usually require less communication overhead than symmetric-key-based counterparts. In this work, we propose the first-of-its-kind tri-mode PKC coprocessor for secured data transmission in Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. For the purpose of low energy consumption, the crypto-coprocessor incorporates three design features, including 1) specialized instruction set for the multi-mode cryptosystems, 2) a highly parallel arithmetic unit for cryptographic kernel operations, and 3) a smart scheduling unit with intelligent control mechanism. By utilizing the parallel arithmetic unit, the proposed crypto-coprocessor can achieve about 50% speed up. Meanwhile, the smart scheduling unit can save up to 18% of the total latency. The crypto-coprocessor was implemented with AHB interface in TSMC 90nm CMOS technology, and the die size is only 1.96 mm(2). Furthermore, our chip is integrated with an ARM-based system-on-chip (SoC) platform for functional verification.","Public-key cryptography; crypto-coprocessor; IoT; SoC","IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), Lisbon, PORTUGAL, MAY 24-27, 2015","Tsai, CR (Corresponding Author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Elect Engn, Taipei 10764, Taiwan.

In this context, machine learning (ML) is increasingly employed in smart grids to solve tasks that require deep data analytics. However, it is well recognized that ML models are vulnerable to adversarial examples that might be contained in open shared data, which creates opportunities for potential attackers to launch cyberattacks. In particular, system operating states acting as critical inputs to ML-based smart grid applications (MLsgAPPs) can be manipulated by malicious actors to mislead the system operator into making wrong decisions that in turn may cause major blackouts and other damaging cascading events. It is thus imperative to advance vulnerability assessment for MLsgAPPs.In this paper, we propose a physics-constrained robustness evaluation framework for MLsgAPPs, which is a first attempt of using tree ensemble (TE) models. Unlike adversarial attacks against prior studied image classification tasks, adversarial examples against TE-based smart grid applications (TEsgAPPs) must not only cheat human intuition but also follow laws of physics and bypass error-checking mechanisms for power systems. Thus, formulation of the traditional robustness evaluation problem must be reconsidered to account for domain-specific misclassification, physical limit, power balance, and error-bypass constraints, in order to obtain tight lower bounds of the magnitudes of tolerated adversarial perturbations. We adopt a formal modeling approach to construct a discrete tree structure and to specify the model evasion conditions. We propose an efficient robustness evaluation method by transforming variables considering ������1 and ������& INFIN; norms, followed by a generalization that expands the variable space to admit other types of norms. Using TE-based power system security assessment as an example, comprehensive simulations are conducted for evaluating the physics-constrained robustness under different TE models and model parameters.","Low-carbon smart grid; Machine learning; Adversarial example; Physics-constrained robustness","","Yang, ZB (Corresponding Author), Guizhou Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Publ Big Data, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China.

The steel bracing system of a foundation pit in Ningbo City, China was taken as the research object to guarantee the stability of the steel bracing system of the foundation pit. Besides, the change of axial force between the two steel bracing structures was analyzed to predict the axial force data of the steel bracing and perform the safety forewarning of the steel bracing system. Firstly, GM (1,1) and Verhulst models in the gray model were selected for prediction based on the characteristics of poor information and the small sample size of original monitoring data of the steel bracing. Secondly, the precision of the GM (1,1) model and Verhulst model was compared to determine a more accurate prediction method. Finally, the safety forewarning model of the confidence interval estimation method was established based on the data obtained from the prediction model and the deformation characteristics and indexes of the steel bracing. With the significance levels alpha = 5% and alpha = 2% as the demarcating points, the forewarning grades of the steel bracing system of the deep foundation pit were divided, and then the operating state of the current steel bracing system was determined. The results demonstrated that the Verhulst model had better prediction precision compared with the ordinary GM (1, 1) model. Besides, the steel bracing system was in the safe operation range, and the judgment results of the model were consistent with the actual situation of the foundation pit of the steel bracing system. Thus, the Verhulst prediction model and the confidence interval security early forewarning model could be used to judge the stability of the steel bracing system.","","","Chen, H (Corresponding Author), Hohai Univ, Coll Business, Nanjing, Peoples R China.

The system security constraints are in fact boundaries that surround all possible operating modes (scenarios) of the power system. In other words, these boundaries form the feasible operating domain - in the parameter space spanned by various operating variables - within which the system can safely be operated. For a given operating scenario, the associated security level is measured by the ``distance'' (for example, the Euclidean norm) of the operating point from the security region boundary. This paper reports on the results of a recently completed research and development paper, which included the development of innovative computerized schemes, which are capable of identifying dynamic operating security modes during the on-line operation of electric power systems. The methodology adopted in this paper includes the development of advanced, highly efficient computerized algorithms for fast identification of dynamic operating security modes of power systems. One of the salient outcomes of this paper is the development of a novel framework for identification and representation of operating security regions in power systems as well as evaluation of security levels associated with different operating scenarios. While the concepts and principles presented are general, the work of this paper is confined to the interpretation of the security boundary in terms of system stability criteria. Of course, the framework presented is applicable quite as well to other criteria that may be considered.","Power system operation; SEC; Security regions; System stability; Operating constraints","2010 IEEE PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition - Smart Solutions for a Changing World, New Orleans, LA, APR 19-22, 2010","Al-Ammar, EA (Corresponding Author), King Saud Univ, Dept Elect Engn, POB 800, Riyadh 11421, Saudi Arabia.

Eight different modes of operation can be selected based on the map graph (concave or convex), the range modification procedure (shrinking or widening) and the sign of one of its independent parameters. The generalization and modification preserve the controllability and continuous chaotic behavior properties, respectively. For the same encryption key and map equation, multi-mode operation occurs through switching between four alternatives of the dependent parameters. Switching between various modes is shown to overpass single modes in randomness by investigating the frequency distribution, autocorrelation function, histograms and 0-1 test. In addition, most bits, 75%, of the scaled and quantized chaotic output are shown to be suitable for pseudo-random number generation based on National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) statistical test suite. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated for several speech, grayscale and RGB images through various evaluation criteria, where good results are achieved. These criteria include basic perceptual and statistical aspects, the more advanced NIST tests, key sensitivity and robustness against brute force and differential attacks. The efficiency of the scheme is improved by up to three or six times faster than encrypting one sample or one channel of a pixel at a time for speech and image inputs, respectively.

Our analysis shows that it is possible to extract this information, essential for security monitoring, purely from the raw network traffic and without background knowledge provided by the control system engineers.

Furthermore, in order to solve the bi-level optimization problem efficiently, an iterative algorithm is proposed. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the relevant conclusions could provide guidance for the development of DPPLC in some provinces of China.","power systems; safe operation; electricity market; direct power purchase","3rd IEEE Student Conference on Electrical Machines and Systems (SCEMS), Jinan, PEOPLES R CHINA, DEC 04-06, 2020","Sang, MS (Corresponding Author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.

Therefore, distribution network operators (DNOs) need effective tools to assess the capability of distribution networks in integrating generation and demand to conduct active management and efficient expansion of networks. However, conventional scenario-based assessment methods only provide conservative and limited information on the network capability, also with exponentially increased computational burden. By contrast, another stream of methods with different philosophy, named as operation region-based methods, describe the overall picture of the network capability analytically with little computational power needed. However, the existing linearized analytical regions, which are mainly applied to electricity transmission networks, cannot describe the capability of distribution networks accurately enough. To solve these problems, a novel feasible operation region (FOR) method with quadratic analytical expressions was proposed to characterize the range of the operating states of distribution networks, where the thermal and voltage constraints will not be violated. The FOR is a geometry in a high-dimensional space, and thus a high-dimensional error analysis approach was further developed for validating the proposed method. The boundary errors are described by multiple distance functions and operational indices, and the conservativeness of the analytical boundaries are quantified. An 11 kV radial distribution network from the United Kingdom Generic Distribution System (UKGDS) was used for the case study. The simulation results show that the quadratic analytical boundaries well approximated the real boundaries of FOR. The maximum errors for thermal and voltage boundaries would maximally cause an overcurrent up to 116 % and an undervoltage down to 0.96p.u., which are able to satisfy the requirements of engineering practice. Compared to the existing linear approximation (termed as hyperplane expressions) of FOR boundaries, the proposed quadratic expressions were proved to have higher accuracy.","Feasible operation region; Hosting capacity; Voltage boundaries; Thermal boundaries; High-dimensional error analysis; Electricity distribution networks","","Zhou, Y (Corresponding Author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Engn, Cardiff CF24 3AA, Wales.

This approach generates local interference and, since the same local environment is used, could lead to security problems. We are investigating the exploitation of idle times in network resources based on a complete mode change in a candidate node. After the detection that some node is idle, a Mode-Switcher boots a new operating system that will work over a separate disk partition. After the boot phase the node is linked to a logical network topology and is available to receive jobs. Users can allocate nodes from this virtual cluster through a standard front-end as they would do in a ``conventional'' cluster. Because nodes may leave and join this virtual machine we use a distributed processor management to allow user applications to cope with this dynamic resource behavior.

Blockchain network architecture is a promising technology for constructing highly secure Internet of Things (IoT) networks. IoT networks typically comprise various sensors and actuators. Blockchain network technology can be applied to secure control robots in smart factories or reliable drone deliveries in smart cities. The wide spread of transactions and shared smart contracts across blockchain networks guarantees ultimate network security. A typical wired blockchain network maintains sufficient redundancy within a stable configuration. However, IoT blockchain networks exhibit unavoidable instability. The dynamic configuration changes caused by flexible node membership make it impossible to achieve the same level of redundancy as a stable network. A trustworthy transaction spreading method provides practical transaction sharing for dynamic IoT networks. We propose a Q-learning framework and a graph convergence network (GCN) to search for the proper spreading path of each transaction. The proposed Q-learning framework determines the next spreading hop using node features. The GCN determines the reliable area based on the Q-learning results. The discovered reliable area guides the proper spreading path of transactions to the destination node. In addition, the proposed trustworthy transaction spreading was implemented over an InterPlanetary File system (IPFS).

Generator ground fault diagnosis enables the protective device to adaptively determine the generator tripping control mode based on the fault degree, and shorten the troubleshooting time by fault location. To accurately calculate the ground fault current under different system operating modes, a real-time grounding capacitance parameters calculation method without injection devices is proposed based on third harmonic voltage. Using the fault component principle, the ground fault current is calculated including the fundamental and the third harmonic components. Through fuzzy membership function, the ground fault degree function is established including the ground fault current and the system overvoltage. It comprehensively reflects the damage degree of both the generator operating security and the system insulation security.

The distribution network reconfiguration technique is often performed to improve these voltage levels, if not to reduce power losses. However, distribution systems feed various kinds of consumers, and their power demand dependency on bus voltages is different based on their load type. Modifying the network configuration changes the system's nodal voltage levels, and then the load power is also impacted after the reconfiguration. Only a few research works in the field of distribution system reconfiguration have included load power dependency to nodal voltages in their proposed models. However, these studies have not discussed whether adding voltage-depend loads to the reconfiguration problem is beneficial or only increases the computational efforts without substantial gains on the optimal solution. With the intention to fill this gap, this article develops a comprehensive analysis of how the change of load according to the voltage affects reconfiguration solutions. This investigation aims to help distribution system researchers and readers understand this phenomenon and highlight the benefits and drawbacks of taking it into account. Also, a robust reconfiguration model for considering load types and nodal voltage is proposed. The model is validated in different network models and sizes, where the obtained results are compared with other models presented in the literature. The results analysis indicates that voltage fluctuations impact the distribution network configuration through voltage effect on power losses and the system nodal loads. Also, load voltage-dependent models are more flexible than constant demand based-formulations in finding feasible solutions in more restricted voltage tolerances.","Distribution system; load type; network re-configuration; power demand; voltage fluctuations","","Mahdavi, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Jaen, Dept Elect Engn, Jaen 23071, Spain.

However, energy storage technologies can help accommodate wind power uncertainty and variability due to their flexible characteristics. This paper focuses on the restoration phase, and provides a novel coordination strategy of wind and pumped-storage hydro (PSH) units for a faster and reliable self-healing process. The wind-PSH assisted power system restoration is formulated as a two-stage adaptive robust optimization problem. The first-stage problem determines the start-up sequence of generators and the energization times of transmission paths; and the second-stage problem decides load pickup sequences, wind power dispatch levels, and PSH units' operating modes. The column-and-constraint generation decomposition algorithm is applied to solve the two-stage adaptive robust optimization problem, which has a mixed-integer optimization in the inner-level problem. The developed coordination strategy is tested on the modified IEEE 39-bus system. Numerical results demonstrate that the coordinated wind and PSH units can increase the total energy served, enhance wind power dispatchability, and reduce wind power curtailment.","Adaptive robust optimization; column-and-constraint generation; mixed-integer linear programming; pumped-storage hydro; self-healing; wind uncertainty","","Golshani, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Cent Florida, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Orlando, FL 32186 USA.

However, the reports of CLC droplets with stable topological configurations are still very limited, which hinders the fast development and broad application of CLC droplet-based devices. In this paper, we manifest light-driven changes in the topological configuration of cholesteric liquid crystals droplets, examined experimentally. Photoresponsive azo-LC doped CLC droplets were manipulated by irradiation by UV light to form novel topological configurations with stable 3D structures. The phenomenon behind the configuration changes is the light-induced cholesteric-isotropic phase transition that takes place in liquid crystals. Several topological configurations of CLC droplets have been demonstrated such as closed-ring structures with cone-shaped centers and concentric elliptical centers, and open-ring structures formed under unidirectional illumination of UV light. Structures with parallel CLC pitch lines at the center and with a central point singularity are also formed under multidirectional illumination. The competition of the elastic energy and surface energy of the CLC droplets results in the formation of the new topological configurations. All proposed configurations are stable and controllable by light, which enable CLC droplets with novel topological structures with new characteristics and provide a lot of potential applications in biosensors and microlasers.","","","Luo, D (Corresponding Author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.

Serving a mobile user automatically by sensing his/her locations in an indoor environment is considered as a challenge. However, indoor localization cannot be carried out effectively using the Global Positioning System (GPS). In recent years, the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in locating a mobile object in an indoor environment has become popular. Some physical features have also been discussed to solve localization in WSNs. In this paper, we inquire into received signal strength indication (RSSI)-based solutions and propose a new localization scheme called the closer tracking algorithm (CTA) for indoor localization. Under the proposed CTA, a mechanism on mode-change is designed to switch automatically between the optimal approximately closer approach (ACA) and the real-time tracking (RTT) method according to pre-tuned thresholds. Furthermore, we design a mechanism to move reference nodes dynamically to reduce the uncovered area of the ACA for increasing the estimation accuracy. We evaluate the proposed CTA using ZigBee CC2431 modules. The experimental results show that the proposed CTA can determine the position accurately with an error distance less than 0.9 m. At the same time, the CTA scheme has at least 87% precision when the distance is less than 0.9m. The proposed CTA can select an adaptive mode properly to improve the localization accuracy with high confidence. Moreover, the experimental results also show that the accuracy can be improved by the deployment and movement of reference nodes.","Indoor localization; wireless sensor networks; RSSI; location-based services; home automation; e-health; ZigBee modules","","Yang, CL (Corresponding Author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.

The user does not need to register with the gateway node. As the light node of the blockchain network, the two can directly authenticate each other. The user obtains the public information of the sensor node from the blockchain through the client and verifies its legitimacy. It solves the problem that the traditional wireless sensor network user authentication scheme cannot be applied to the distributed Internet of things environment and the authentication process is low in security and efficiency. Mode 1 is the disordered charging mode. The charging facility provides continuous constant power charging service for the connected response subject until the user leaves. If the response subject is full before this, the charging will stop. Mode 2 is the BADR operation mode under charging optimization only, that is, the V2G function of PEV is not considered. In this case, 0 < P-l,P-k <= P-l(max c). Mode 3 is the BADR operating mode with V2G functionality in mind. The ELN load characteristics under the above three operating modes are discussed, respectively. Calculate and compare with economy on both sides of supply and demand. The experimental results show that the discharge compensation coefficient will not affect mode 2. In mode 3, as the compensation coefficient increases (from 0.4 to 1.2 at intervals of 0.2), the average total cost of the PEV cluster continues to decrease and the average total cost of the energy local network (ELN) system increases monotonically. Comparing the curves of the economic impact of the compensation coefficient on both sides of mode 2 and mode 3, it can be seen that the reasonable setting of the compensation coefficient is one of the key parameters for controlling the distribution of benefits. It proves that the proposed blockchain-based automated demand response (BADR) method can not only meet the satisfaction of energy demand but also coordinate the available energy storage resources in the system, so that the load level curve can track the output of new energy to the greatest extent and improve the balance between supply and demand of the system, which is suitable for a large-scale decentralized energy storage system.","","","Shah, MA (Corresponding Author), Kebri Dehar Univ, Kebri Dehar, Ethiopia.

It is used for logging ingress and egress IP traffic flows, number of bytes and packets transmitted and received, and network connections. Flow logging is critical for the investigation of firewall functionalities, security incidents, and threat detection. Moreover, it can be used for detecting connection and network anomalies such as connection outages, configuration changes, or malicious activities. Alerts can be fired for any suspicious network activities. Visualization of flows logs provides insights such as who is using a web-service or an application, when customers are logged in and out, and what are the geographical locations where connections are being initiated or terminated. In this paper, a novel method for VNF that details the framework for logging network flows in a Cloud environment is provided. The method aims at accommodating multiple and simulations Cloud tenants and enabling the logging of network flows while at the same time accommodates high incoming rates of flow events and data. One of the major benefits of this new method is that it supports high number of flows per second that facilitates flow logging of high traffic volumes. Not only customers can experience higher number of flows logged, but the flow logs are visualized and contain the number of packets and bytes transmitted and received for outbound and inbound flows, respectively.","Cloud; Distributed System; flow logging; virtualization; SDN; VNF","9th Annual IEEE Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics and Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON), New York, NY, NOV 08-10, 2018","Fattah, H (Corresponding Author), Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.

This paper focuses on a robust controller design scheme for inverter-interfaced distributed generators considering various operating modes and loading conditions of microgrids. Especially, during the island mode, the voltage and system frequency can easily change due to instant power mismatch between distributed generators and loads in the microgrid.

In this paper we discuss the shortfall between generic C implementations and optimized (inline-) assembly versions while providing a large spectrum of efficient and generic masked implementations for any order, and demonstrate cryptographic algorithms and masking gadgets with reference to the state of the art. Our main goal is to show the prime performance gaps we can expect between different implementations and suggest how to harness the underlying hardware efficiently, a daunting task for various masking-orders or masking algorithm (multiplications, refreshing etc.). This paper focuses on implementations targeting wide vector bitsliced designs, such as the ISAP algorithm. We explore concrete instances of implementations utilizing processors enabled by wide-vector capability extensions of the AMD64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA); namely, the SSE2/3/4.1, AVX-2 and AVX-512 Streaming Single Instruction Multiple Data extensions. These extensions mainly enable efficient memory level parallelism and provide a gradual reduction in computation-time as a function of the level of extension and the hardware support for instruction-level parallelism. For the first time we provide a complete open-source repository of such gadgets tailored for these extensions, various gadgets types and for all orders. We evaluate the disparities between generic high-level language masking implementations for optimized (inline-) assembly and conventional single execution path data-path architectures such as the ARM architecture. We underscore the crucial trade-off between state storage in the data-memory as compared to keeping it in the register-file (RF). This relates specifically to masked designs, and is particularly difficult to resolve because it requires inline-assembly manipulations and is not natively supported by compilers. Moreover, as the masking order (d) increases and the state gets larger, there must be an increase in data memory read/write accesses for state handling since the RF is simply not large enough. This requires careful optimization which depends to a considerable extent on the underlying algorithm to implement. We discuss how full utilization of SSE extensions is not always possible; i.e. when d is not a power of two, and pin-point the optimal d values and very sub-optimal values of d which aggressively under-utilize the hardware. More generally, this paper presents several different fully generic masked implementations for any order or multiple highly optimized (inline-) assembly instances which are quite generic (for a wide spectrum of ISAs and extensions), and provide very specific implementations targeting specific extensions. The goal is to promote open-source availability, research, improvement and implementations relating to SCA security and masked designs. The building blocks and methodologies provided here are portable and can be easily adapted to other algorithms.","AVX; Countermeasures; Code-size; Low-cost; Masking; Side-channel analysis; Security order; SIMD; SSE","","Levi, I (Corresponding Author), BIU, Ramat Gan, Israel.

However, it is difficult to measure accurately using the existing method, which is based on parameter assumption without considering the field water conditions. In this study, a generic and physically based method for blue, green, and grey water accounting in paddy rice cultivation is introduced. We conducted field experiments using the common flood irrigation (CFI) and water-saving irrigation (SWI) modes in Nanjing, East China. By tracing the sources of ET and the migration process of multiple pollutants (TN, TP, NH4+-N, and NO3--N), the characteristics of blue-green water con-sumption and the actual amount of water required to dilute pollutants at different growth stages of rice under CFI and SWI were analyzed. The WF of paddy rice was 1000 m(3)/t (49% WFgreen, 17% WFblue, 34% WFgrey) and 910 m(3)/t (50% WFgreen, 10% WFblue, 40% WFgrey) for CFI and SWI, respectively. The WF for paddy rice production was reduced by approximately 9% under SWI compared to CFI, with declines of 47% for WFblue and 8% for WFgreen. The SWI mode changed the ratio of blue to green water fluxes in field water by reducing irrigation during non-critical periods, and green water was used preferentially to enhance its utility. This conceptual method is the first to describe the formation mechanism of blue, green, and grey WFs in paddy systems.

Managing traditional desktop environments is incredibly challenging and costly. Tasks like installations, configuration changes, security measures require time-consuming procedures and dedicated deskside support. Also these distributed desktops are typically underutilized, resulting in low ROI for these assets. Further, this distributed computing model for desktops also creates a security concern as sensitive information could be compromised with stolen laptops or PCs. Desktop virtualization, which moves computation to the data center, allows users to access their applications and data using stateless ``thin-client'' devices and therefore alleviates some of the problems of traditional desktop computing. Enterprises can now leverage the flexibility and cost-benefits of running users' desktops on virtual machines hosted at the data center to enhance business agility and reduce business risks, while lowering TCO. Recent research and development of cloud computing paradigm opens new possibilities of mass hosting of desktops and providing them as a service. However, transformation of legacy systems to desktop clouds as well as proper capacity provisioning is a challenging problem. Desktop cloud needs to be appropriately designed and provisioned to offer low response time and good working experience to desktop users while optimizing back-end resource usage and therefore minimizing provider's costs. This paper presents tools and approaches we have developed to facilitate fast and accurate planning for desktop clouds. We present desktop workload profiling and benchmarking tools as well as desktop to cloud transformation process enabling fast and accurate transition of legacy systems to new cloud-based model.","","23rd IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium, Rome, ITALY, MAY 23-29, 2009","Beaty, K (Corresponding Author), IBM TJ Watson Res Ctr, 19 Skyline Dr, Hawthorne, NY 10532 USA.

In the second stage, a multi-mode data-driven local control strategy is designed in real-time Volt/Var control (VVC) with three operation modes, which are energy saving mode, reactive power reservation mode and security operation mode respectively. The coordination and transition among different control modes allow system operators to achieve both energy savings and voltage security under various conditions. The flexible reactive power margin of PVs can also be adaptively improved through cooperation with CBs. Moreover, a data-driven deep convolution neural network (CNN) is developed and trained as a local controller (LC) to regulate the reactive power of PVs based on local measurements. The influence of input selections on training losses is analyzed in detail, and a clustering-based data preprocessing method is also proposed to simplify the training process without compromising the training performance.

Traditional protection systems are non-adaptive and have been usually applied with bias towards dependability, one of the two considerations on designing electric grid protection systems (the other one is security). The art and science of protection and control of tomorrow drives the power system professionals to design and implement schemes that are adaptive and aim towards security. It is important to minimize system exposures when the power system is in a stressed state or in early stages of a sequence of events to halt or mitigate disturbance propagation. One of the leading contributions to the future of grid protection would be to avoid incorrect tripping of unaffected equipment therefore maintaining the power system integrity. In addition, with the ever-increasing load demand and the advent of the deregulated power market recently, power systems are pushed more often to operate close to design limits and with more uncertainty of the system operating mode. The proposed protection systems offer adaptive concepts by adjusting the need for more dependability or security as applicable, through the application of fuzzy logic and based on a set of real-time factors, such as system state index, nodal price, and equipment outage impact index. Results from our work can be used as a roadmap for further enhancement leading to the introduction of algorithms in commercial products.","dependability; security; fuzzy logic; protection systems; adaptive","IEEE/PES Transmission and Distribution Conference and Exposition, Chicago, IL, APR 21-24, 2008","Khorashadi-Zadeh, H (Corresponding Author), IIT, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Chicago, IL 60616 USA.

However, the requirements of information can vary widely among users depending on their region, socioenvironmental context, and interests. Moreover, in the current era of active mitigation and adaptation policies, information needs are frequently not satisfied even by these massive and variated collections of databases. The development and use of emulators can help closing this information gap by allowing users to approximate the output from complex models and create user-defined experiments, without being technically or computational demanding on the user. Here, a simple emulator of the EPIC biophysical crop model is presented which is able to adequately reproduce the changes in rainfed maize and to create projections for user-defined scenarios. Moreover, it allows to produce risk measures that are not available with the original model. The proposed methodology is illustrated with a case study of rainfed maize production in Mexico for a reference emissions scenario (SSP370) and two user-defined international mitigation policy scenarios. These scenarios represent 1) current international mitigation commitments and 2) a scenario in which China withdraws from international mitigation efforts. Results showed that, under the reference scenario, climate change could have widespread consequences on rainfed production all over the country with decreases in yields reaching up to 80% in the southeast and northeast of the country. These impacts can be partially modulated by the moderately ambitious mitigation commitments assumed in recent international agreements if all countries comply. However, a potential withdraw of China from these efforts would significantly reduce any benefits from international mitigation. Under all scenarios, changes in productivity impose increasing risks for already vulnerable populations and considerable economic costs at the state and national levels. These results suggest the urgent need for critical planning for adaptation in the agricultural sector of the country.","climate change; agriculture; emulator; risk; integrated assesment","","Estrada, F (Corresponding Author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Ciencias Atmosfera, Mexico City, Mexico.

The interfacing circuits of DG and their controls have to comply with utility quality regulations and afford a seamless transition from online to offline and vice versa. This article advises a simple and robust control scheme for a modular multilevel converter (MMC) that interfaces with a photovoltaic (PV) generator. The proposed control method ensures high-quality output voltage/current waveform in online and/or offline operating modes. Moreover, the proposed control provides a seamless and swift transition from standalone to grid-connected and vice versa. The exhibited control scheme is simulated with MATLAB/Simulink. Real-time simulator OPAL-RT OP4510 is used to verify the displayed simulation results.

This will enable a system operator to detect and uniquely identify potential faults or attacks, despite the presence of process and measurement noise. Since the resulting model discrimination problem is a nonlinear non-convex mixed-integer program, we propose to solve this in a computationally tractable manner, albeit only approximately, by proposing a sequence of restrictions that guarantee that the obtained input is separating. Finally, we apply our approach to attack detection in the area of cyber-physical systems security. (C) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

The sequential composition of F(.) and G(.) is the function G(F(.)), the parallel composition is F(.) * G(.) where * is some group operation. It has been shown that composition indeed gives adaptive security in the information theoretic setting, but unfortunately the proof does not translate into the more interesting computational case. In this work we show that in the computational setting composition does not imply adaptive security: If there is a prime order cyclic group where the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption holds, then there are functions F and G which are indistinguishable by non-adaptive polynomially time-bounded adversaries, but whose parallel composition can be completely broken (i.e. we recover the key) with only three adaptive queries. We give a similar result for sequential composition.

The SC development lacks standard design processes that follow software lifecycle principles to model secure SC. Secondly, the security mechanisms in the SC are not constantly evolved to resist evolving adversary attacks. BBC systems lack self-adaptive security capability to make spontaneous decisions when adversarial attacks are encountered. To build a self-adaptive secure BBC system that follows standard software development lifecycle principles to model secure SC, we propose the so-called self-adaptive security RE_BBC framework. The framework would utilize the MAPE-BBC adaptation loop to make decisions internally based on the threat models, goal models, and service level agreement (SLA) SC security specifications. The framework identifies vulnerabilities and threats and takes precautionary measures using self-adaptive SC agents. We validated the proposed methodology theoretically and empirically, and statistically proved the research questions and hypothesis using the t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. Subsequently, we compare our proposed approach with the Security Quality Requirements Engineering approach (SQUARE). The feasibility results and the replicated study results indicate that the proposed approach outperformed the SQUARE approach in terms of artifacts quality, self-adaptive security evaluation quality, efficiency in response time, complexity, and usefulness of the proposed approach for the Healthcare Data Management (HDM) system. SC security developers can immensely benefit from our proposed methodology. They need not reengineer SC from scratch; depending on their security needs and plan, the contract can be adapted to execute a new plan.","security; attacks; vulnerabilities; goal model; threat model; self-adaptation; SLA; smart contract; blockchain; cloud; healthcare","","Lee, SW (Corresponding Author), Ajou Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Suwon 16499, South Korea.

This study presents a novel CPF model and its decoupling algorithm for multi-area AC/DC interconnected systems incorporating a voltage source converter (VSC)-based multi-terminal direct current (MTDC) network. This CPF model includes the following unique features: (1) In view of the bilateral power trading contracts among regional subsystems, the nonlinear constraint equations of directional trading active power via interface are derived, and the multi-balancing machine strategy is introduced to realize the active power balance of each subsystem. (2) An accurate simulation method for the security control behaviors of the power allocation in tie-lines is proposed, which includes a specific selection strategy for automatic generation control units and a generation re-dispatch strategy. These two strategies work together to prevent the serious overload in tie-lines during load growth and improve the voltage stability margin of the interconnected bulk systems. (3) The switching characteristic of reactive power control behaviors of VSC stations is simulated in the CPF calculation. In the end, a novel decoupling CPF algorithm based on bi-directional iteration is presented to realize the decomposition and coordination calculation. This decoupling algorithm preserves the precision and convergence of integrated CPF algorithms, and it has an apparent advantage on the calculation speed. Furthermore, this decoupling algorithm also can easily reflects the effects of the control mode changes of VSC stations to the voltage stability margin of AC system.

New architecture and designs are required for the in-vehicle systems to address these emerging concerns. Early design decisions have a large impact on the required functionalities as well as the quality attributes of these systems. Understanding the impact of design decisions on the system quality is crucial for successful system development. It is difficult to estimate the requirements for safety (at an early development stage) considering the innovation aspect of automated driving. These safety requirements have a considerable influence on project planning and development cost. Therefore, it is important for the industry to understand the decision points and their impact on system design. In this article, we share our experience on understanding the impact of early design decisions on safety requirements. We particularly discuss the impact of design decisions regarding the operational design domain on (functional) safety. We provide two automated driving systems as discussion cases and investigate the impact of the operational situation on the safety requirements such as safe state and degraded operating mode. We show how posting small constraints on the operational situation can result in simplification of the sensor and actuator requirements of these systems.","","13th Annual IEEE International Systems Conference (SysCon), Orlando, FL, APR 08-11, 2019","Saberi, AK (Corresponding Author), TNO Tech Sci Automot, Helmond, Netherlands.

The network security is usually reflected by some relevant data that can be collected in a network system. By learning and analyzing such data, which are called security-related data, we can detect the intrusions to the network system and further measure its security level. Clearly, the first step of detecting network intrusions is to collect security-related data. However, in the context of 5G and big data, there are a number of challenges in collecting these data due to the heterogeneity of network and ever-growing amount of data. Therefore, traditional data collection methods cannot be applied in the next generation network systems directly, especially for security-related data. This paper presents the design and implementation of an adaptive security-related data collector based on network context in heterogeneous networks. The proposed collector solves the issue of heterogeneity of network system by designing a Security-related Data Description Language (SDDL) to instruct security related data collection in various networking contexts. It also applies adaptive sampling algorithms to reduce the amount of collected data. Furthermore, performance evaluation based on a prototype implementation shows the effectiveness of the adaptive security-related data collector in terms of a number of pre-defined design requirements.","Security-related data; Adaptive data collection; Heterogeneous network; Network context","","Yan, Z (Corresponding Author), Xidian Univ, Sch Cyber Engn, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

Using bilinear maps, we then construct broadcast encryption systems that are semi-statically secure in the standard model and have constant-size ciphertexts. Our semi-static constructions work when the number of indices or identifiers in the system is polynomial in the security parameter.

Using the Event-driven Adaptive Security (EDAS) model, we provide the assessment of dynamic trade-off decisions in the IoT. We have showed that an optimum trade-off mitigation response in the IoT can be automated by assessing various contextual requirements, such as the QoS and user preferences, thing capabilities, and the risk faced, at runtime. eHealth scenarios are examined to illustrate system application in IoT-based remote patient monitoring systems.","Internet of Things; Adaptive Security; eHealth; Event Driven Architecture","10th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST), London, UNITED KINGDOM, DEC 14-16, 2015","Aman, W (Corresponding Author), Gjovik Univ Coll, Norwegian Informat Secur Lab NISLab, Gjovik, Norway.

Unlike for many other cryptographic building blocks (like public -key encryption, signatures, or zeroknowledge proofs), all known NIKE security reductions to date are nontight, i.e., lose a factor of at least the number of users in the system. In that sense, NIKE forms a particularly elusive target for tight security reductions. The main technical obstacle in achieving tightly secure NIKE schemes are adaptive corruptions. Hence, in this work, we explore security notions and schemes that lie between selective security and fully adaptive security. Concretely: WE EXHIBIT A TRADEOFF BETWEEN KEY SIZE AND REDUCTION LOSS. We show that a tighter reduction can be bought by larger public and secret NIKE keys. Concretely, we present a simple NIKE scheme with a reduction loss of 0 (N2 log(v)/v2), and public and secret keys of 0(v) group elements, where N denotes the overall number of users in the system, and v is a freely adjustable scheme parameter. Our scheme achieves full adaptive security even against multiple ``test queries'' (i.e., adversarial challenges), but requires keys of size 0(N) to achieve (almost) tight security under the matrix Diffie-Hellman assumption. Still, already this simple scheme circumvents existing lower bounds. WE SHOW THAT THIS TRADEOFF IS INHERENT. We contrast the security of our simple scheme with a lower bound for all NIKE schemes in which shared keys can be expressed as an ``inner product in the exponent''. This result covers the original Diffie-Hellman NIKE scheme, as well as a large class of its variants, and in particular our simple scheme. Our lower bound gives a tradeoff between the ``dimension'' of any such scheme (which directly corresponds to key sizes in existing schemes), and the reduction quality. For v = 0(N), this shows our simple scheme and reduction optimal (up to a logarithmic factor). WE EXHIBIT A TRADEOFF BETWEEN SECURITY AND KEY SIZE FOR TIGHT REDUCTIONS. We show that it is possible to circumvent the inherent tradeoff above by relaxing the desired security notion. Concretely, we consider the natural notion of semi-adaptive security, where the adversary has to commit to a single test query after seeing all public keys. As a feasibility result, we bring forward the first scheme that enjoys compact public keys and tight semi-adaptive security under the conjunction of the matrix Diffie-Hellman and learning with errors assumptions. We believe that our results shed a new light on the role of adaptivity in NIKE security, and also illustrate the special role of NIKE when it comes to tight security reductions.","Tight reductions; Non-interactive key exchange; Pairings; Learning with errors","19th Theory of Cryptography Conference (TCC), N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC, NOV 08-11, 2021","Langrehr, R (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland.

Based on the dynamic heterogeneous redundancy architecture, the proposed architecture introduces intelligent scheduling of executors, intelligent arbitration of multi-state service response, cleaning and reconstruction of executors, and attack surface management. We establish a closed-loop core control process of decision and processing, adjustment and scheduling, cleaning reconstruction, migration, and recovery. Furthermore, a dynamic scheduling algorithm based on executor credit and heterogeneity is proposed. The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional smart grid security architecture, the PHSA has better defense ability and system reliability, significantly improving the security of edge enabled smart grid system.

Long range and wide spectral performance requirements favor reflective optical system design solutions. The limited field of view of such designs can be significantly enhanced by the use of catadioptric optical solutions that utilize molded or diamond point machined VIS-IR lenses downstream from reflective objective optics. A common optical aperture that services multiple modes of field-of-view, operating wavelength, and includes laser ranging and spotting, provides the highest utility and is most ideal for size and weight. Such a design also often requires fast, highly aspheric, reflective, refractive, and sometimes diffractive surfaces using high performance and aggressively light-weighted materials that demand the finest of manufacturing technologies. Visible wavelength performance sets the bar for component optical surface irregularity on the order of 20 nm RMS and surface finishes less than 3.0 nm RMS. Aluminum mirrors and structures can also be precision machined to yield ``snap together alignment'' or limited compensation assembly approaches to reduce cost and enhance interchangeability. Diamond point turning, die cast and investment cast mirror substrates and structures, computerized optical polishing, mirror replication, lens molding and other advanced manufacturing technologies can all be used to minimize the cost of this type of optical equipment. This paper discusses the tradeoffs among materials and process selection for catadioptric, multi-mode systems that are under development for a variety of DoD and Homeland Security applications.

The grid chosen for this study has significant voltage fluctuations and periodic voltage drops and surges, including total power loss. A supply of methane from a sewer sludge digester is scrubbed Of CO2 and used for continuous standby operation, with excess stored to enable 8 h operation of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS).

Climate change will bring temperature changes, acidification and other environmental change, with uncertain consequences for human and natural systems, but there has been little regional-scale climate modelling of the marine ecosystem. We present initial dynamically downscaled projections using a biogeochemical model suitable for coastal and shelf seas. A coupled physical-biogeochemical model with a resolution of 0.1 degrees (approximately 11 km) was used to create projections of future environmental conditions under moderate (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas scenarios. Changes for different parts of the region are presented, including four sensitive coastal sites of key importance for biodiversity and sustainable development: UNESCO Biosphere Reserves at Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An in Vietnam, Palawan in the Philippines and Taka Bonerate-Kepulauan Selayar in Indonesia, and coastal waters of Sabah, Malaysia, which include several marine parks. The projections show a sea that is warming by 1.1 to 2.9 degrees C through the 21st century, with dissolved oxygen decreasing by 5 to 13 mmol m(-3) and changes in many other environmental variables. The changes reach all parts of the water column and many places are projected to experience conditions well outside the range seen at the start of the century. The resulting damage to coral reefs and altered species distribution would have consequences for biodiversity, the livelihoods of small-scale fishers and the food security of coastal communities. Further work using a range of global models and regional models with different biogeochemical components is needed to provide confidence levels, and we suggest some ways forward. Projections of this type serve as a key tool for communities and policymakers as they plan how they will adapt to the challenge of climate change.","marine ecosystem model; marine biogeochemical model; regional climate modeling; climate change; southeast Asia; biosphere reserve","","Kay, S (Corresponding Author), Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth, England.

The optimization problem is formulated to schedule the system operation in both normal and islanding modes by addressing the prevailing uncertainties of islanding duration as well as prediction errors of loads, renewable power generation, and electricity price. In a normal operation mode, where the grid-connection is available, the energy and reserve of local resources and energy trading with the main grid is scheduled to maximize the operator's profit considering feasible islanding. In a resilient operating mode, which is triggered by a disturbance in the main grid, the local resources should be scheduled to supply loads with the lowest emergency load shedding. To balance the economy and security requirements under uncertainties, the optimal scheduling is done properly through a security-constrained power flow method by considering system's objectives and constraints. Moreover, to properly handle the uncertainties of the problem, conditional value-at-risk metric is incorporated with the optimization model to control the risk of profit variability. The proposed scheme is implemented on a test microgrid and various case studies are presented to verify its effectiveness in normal and resiliency operating conditions.","Microgrids; Uncertainty; Optimal scheduling; Stochastic processes; Islanding; Load modeling; Indexes; Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR); demand response; optimal scheduling; resilient microgrid; stochastic framework","","Vahedipour-Dahraie, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Birjand, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Birjand 5632202001, Iran.

In the semi-adaptive model the attacker is forced to disclose the challenge messages before it makes any key queries, but is allowed to see the public parameters. We show how to generically transform any selectively secure ABE or FE scheme into one that is semi-adaptively secure with the only additional assumption being public key encryption, which is already naturally included in almost any scheme of interest. Our technique utilizes a fairly simple application of garbled circuits where instead of encrypting directly, the encryptor creates a garbled circuit that takes as input the public parameters and outputs a ciphertext in the underlying selective scheme. Essentially, the encryption algorithm encrypts without knowing the `real' public parameters. This allows one to delay giving out the underlying selective parameters until a private key is issued, which connects the semi-adaptive to selective security. The methods used to achieve this result suggest that the moral gap between selective and semi-adaptive security is in general much smaller than that between semiadaptive and full security. Finally, we show how to extend the above idea to generically bundle a family of functionalities under one set of public parameters. For example, suppose we had an inner product predicate encryption scheme where the length of the vectors was specified at setup and therefore fixed to the public parameters. Using our transformation one could create a system where for a single set of public parameters the vector length is not apri-ori bounded, but instead is specified by the encryption algorithm. The resulting ciphertext would be compatible with any private key generated to work on the same input length.","","14th International Theory of Cryptography Conference (TCC), Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA, OCT 31-NOV 03, 2016","Goyal, R (Corresponding Author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.

We have argued that incorporating an explicit representation of the environment's topology enables reasoning on the location of assets being protected and the proximity of potentially harmful agents. This paper proposes to engineer topology aware adaptive security systems by identifying violations of security requirements that may be caused by topological changes, and selecting a set of security controls that prevent such violations. Our approach focuses on physical topologies; it maintains at runtime a live representation of the topology which is updated when assets or agents move, or when the structure of the physical space is altered. When the topology changes, we look ahead at a subset of the future system states. These states are reachable when the agents move within the physical space. If security requirements can be violated in future system states, a configuration of security controls is proactively applied to prevent the system from reaching those states. Thus, the system continuously adapts to topological stimuli, while maintaining requirements satisfaction. Security requirements are formally expressed using a propositional temporal logic, encoding spatial properties in Computation Tree Logic (CTL). The Ambient Calculus is used to represent the topology of the operational environment -including location of assets and agents - as well as to identify future system states that are reachable from the current one. The approach is demonstrated and evaluated using a substantive example concerned with physical access control.","","IEEE 22nd International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE), Blekinge Inst Technol, Karlskrona, SWEDEN, AUG 25-29, 2014","Tsigkanos, C (Corresponding Author), Politecn Milan, I-20133 Milan, Italy.

Distinct from the previous approaches in this field, our scheme not only efficiently realizes access control over encrypted data in a fine-grained and revocable way but also is proved to be adaptively secure under standard decision linear assumption.

Our approach avoids, weaknesses of traditional RBAC approaches and provides a practically usable security model for Multi-agent Systems (MAS). A unified role interaction model framework has been put forward that incorporates not only functional requirements but also security constraints in MAS. A security policy rule scheme has been used to express security requirements in relation to affective roles. The major contribution of the work is that little redevelopment effort will be required when security is to be engineered into the overall MAS architecture, hence minimising the impact of the security requirements changes to the MAS architecture.

Following the IEEE Standard 1547.4-2011, the operation and control of large distribution networks can be enhanced by dividing these networks into multiple virtual microgrids. The proposed planning framework incorporates the necessary conditions for microgrids to operate efficiently in grid-connected operating mode and successfully during islanding. To obtain a robust design, the clustering process considers three objectives: maximizing the self-adequacy of the designed microgrids, maximizing microgrid islanding success probability, and a combination of both targets. For this purpose, the PG&E distribution system with 69 buses is selected as a test case. Backtracking search optimization algorithm, a probabilistic load flow approach, and graph-based theories are used to accomplish this research. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the self-adequacy and the islanding success probability objectives in the clustering process. Compared with other strategies present in the previous literature, the proposed framework results in more self-sufficient and successful islands assessed in terms of active and reactive power adequacy as well as voltage constraints. Next, the effects of increased penetration level of DGs and installation of both distributed energy-storage units and distributed reactive sources on the design process are examined. Finally, a comparison with other microgrid design objectives applied in previous researches reveals that the resultant design is sensitive to the system's reliability, security, and economic requirements.","Backtracking search; clustering; islanding; microgrid design; optimization; reactive sources; self-adequacy; storage units","","Zobaa, AF (Corresponding Author), Brunel Univ London, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.

While the evidence suggests that a supportive built environment may be needed to promote walking and cycling, it is unclear whether and how interventions in the built environment that attract walkers and cyclists may reduce transport CO2 emissions. Our aim was therefore to evaluate the effects of providing new infrastructure for walking and cycling on CO2 emissions from motorized travel. A cohort of 1849 adults completed questionnaires at baseline (2010) and one-year follow-up (2011), before and after the construction of new high-quality routes provided as part of the Sustrans Connect2 programme in three UK municipalities. A second cohort of 1510 adults completed questionnaires at baseline and two-year follow-up (2012). The participants reported their past-week travel behaviour and car characteristics from which CO2 emissions by mode and purpose were derived using methods described previously. A set of exposure measures of proximity to and use of the new routes were derived. Overall transport CO2 emissions decreased slightly over the study period, consistent with a secular trend in the case study regions. As found previously the new infrastructure was well used at one- and two-year follow-up, and was associated with population-level increases in walking, cycling and physical activity at two-year follow-up. However, these effects did not translate into sizeable CO2 effects as neither living near the infrastructure nor using it predicted changes in CO2 emissions from motorized travel, either overall or disaggregated by journey purpose. This lack of a discernible effect on travel CO2 emissions are consistent with an interpretation that some of those living nearer the infrastructure may simply have changed where they walked or cycled, while others may have walked or cycled more but few, if any, may have substituted active for motorized modes of travel as a result of the interventions. While the findings to date cannot exclude the possibility of small effects of the new routes on CO2 emissions, a more comprehensive approach of a higher `dosage' of active travel promotion linked with policies targeted at mode shift away from private motorized transport (such as urban car restraint and parking pricing, car sharing/pooling for travel to work, integrating bike sharing into public transport system) may be needed to achieve the substantial CO2 savings needed to meet climate change mitigation and energy security goals.

This security analysis helps independent system operator (ISO) to have a better planning and market clearing criteria during any operating state of the system. Design/methodology/approach - A multi-objective optimization problem has been developed including real power performance index (RPPI) and expected security cost (ESC). A security constrained optimal power flow has been developed as expected security cost optimal power flow problem which gives the probabilities of operating the system in all possible pre-contingency and post-contingency states subjected to various equality and inequality constraints. Maximizing social welfare is the objective function considered for normal state, while minimizing compensations for generations rescheduling and maximizing social welfare are the objectives in case of contingency states. The proposed work is viewed as a two level problem wherein the upper-level problem is to optimally locate IPFC using RPPI and the lower-level problem is to minimize the ESC subjected to various system constraints. Both upper-level and lower-level problem are solved using particle swarm optimization and The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested under severe line outages and has been validated using IEEE 30 bus system. Findings - The proposed methodology shows that IPFC controls the power flows in the network without generation rescheduling or topological changes and thus improves the performance of the system. It is found that the benefit achieved in the ESC due to the installation of IPFC is greater than the annual investment cost of the device. ISO cannot achieve minimum total system cost by merely rescheduling generators. Instead of rescheduling, FACTS devices can be used for compensation by achieving minimum cost. IPFC can be used to compensate the congested lines and transfer cheaper power from generators to consumers. Originality/value - Operational reliability, financial profitability and efficient utilization of the existing transmission system infrastructure has been achieved using single FACTS device. Instead of using multiple FATCS devices, if a single FACTS device like IPFC which itself can compensate several transmission lines is used, then in addition to the facility for independently controlled reactive (series) compensation of each individual line, it provides a capability to directly transfer real power between the compensated lines. Hence an attempt has been made in this paper to incorporate IPFC for relieving congestion in a deregulated environment. However, no previous researches have considered incorporating compensation of multi-transmission line using single IPFC in minimizing ESC. Thus, in this paper, the authors indicate how much the ESC is reduced by installing IPFC.","Congestion management; ESC; FACTS; IPFC; RPPI","","Velayutham, U (Corresponding Author), St Josephs Coll Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.

In this study, a programmable adaptive security scanning (PASS) approach is presented to protect DER inverters against various power-bot attacks. Specifically, three different types of attacks, namely controller manipulation, replay, and injection attacks, are considered. This approach employs both software-defined networking technique and a novel coordinated detection method capable of enabling programmable and scalable networked microgrids (NMs) in an ultra-resilient, time-saving, and autonomous manner. The coordinated detection method efficiently identifies the location and type of power-bot attacks without disrupting normal NM operations.

In order to achieve a proper operation of the microgrid, the presence of a microgrid control system is crucial. The IEEE 2030.7 standard defines the microgrid control system as a key element of the microgrid that regulates every aspect of it at the point-of-interconnection with the distribution system, and autonomously manages operations such as the transitions of operating modes. In this paper, a microgrid control system is developed to achieve real-time monitoring and control through a centralized approach. The controller consists of a centralized server and advanced field units that are also developed during this work. The control functions of the centralized server ensure the proper operation during grid-connected and island modes, using the real-time data received via the advanced field unit. The developed server and the field unit constitute a complete system solution. The server is composed of control function and communication, database, and user interface modules. The microgrid control functions comprise dispatch and transition core-level functions. A rule-based core-level dispatch function guarantees the security of supply to critical loads during the islanded mode. The core-level transition function accomplishes a successful transition between the operation modes. Moreover, a communication framework and a graphical user interface are implemented.

This paper addresses the adaptive security activities selection model as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) issue. Analytic Network Process (ANP) is proposed for weight calculation and criteria prioritization. Hypothetical examples were presented based on hard constraints faced by in-house web-based application development team in two different scenarios. The Decision Maker made the judgement by using the online ASAS model. The results show that experience, skill and knowledge get the highest priority in the first scenario while budget/ cost get the highest priority in the second scenario.

Such devices will however be broadly used only if they are ``prescribed'' by the hospitals as a part of a therapy and are reimbursed by the insurances. For this we need the proof of their safety, medical efficacy and economic efficiency. Aside of obligatory clinical trials we need an extensive system of post-market surveillance, because: a medical device is a part of a complex cyber-physical system, with humans in the loop/the environment cannot be sufficiently defined/humans react differently to the therapy, they also behave differently / after every software upgrade the device is not the same as before In their operation such devices generate huge amounts of data that can be reused for such analysis. Technically oriented people believe it can be done using a Big Data Analytics system without a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. It is doubtful if such approach can deliver useful results. The main problems seem to be: unbalanced cohort/various patient groups with various preferences/multiple quality parameters (basic algorithm, signal propagation, battery, security and privacy, obtrusiveness, etc.)/multiple variants (operating modes, device settings)/variability of the device and of the environment. When we transform data into ``actionable knowledge'', especially if the generated decisions influence human health, utmost care has to be applied. The goal of this paper is to present the complexity of the problem, warn against hasty, purely technical solutions, raise interest among specialists in health statistics and ignite an interdisciplinary cooperation to solve it.","","10th International Conference on P2P, Parallel, Grid, Cloud and Internet Computing 3PGCIC, Krakow, POLAND, NOV 04-06, 2015","Sliwa, J (Corresponding Author), Bern Univ Appl Sci, Quellgasse 21, CH-2501 Biel, Switzerland.

With informed knowledge of a patient's history, physicians can make prompt clinical decisions for smarter, safer, and more efficient care. However, due to the privacy and high sensitivity of electronic health records (EHR), most EHR data sharing still happens through fax or mail due to the lack of systematic infrastructure support for secure, trustable health data sharing, which can also cause major delays in patient care. Objective: Our goal was to develop a system that will facilitate secure, trustable management, sharing, and aggregation of EHR data. Our patient-centric system allows patients to manage their own health records across multiple hospitals. The system will ensure patient privacy protection and guarantee security with respect to the requirements for health care data management, including the access control policy specified by the patient. Methods: We propose a permissioned blockchain-based system for EHR data sharing and integration. Each hospital will provide a blockchain node integrated with its own EHR system to form the blockchain network. A web-based interface will be used for patients and doctors to initiate EHR sharing transactions. We take a hybrid data management approach, where only management metadata will be stored on the chain Actual EHR data, on the other hand, will be encrypted and stored off-chain in Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant cloud-based storage. The system uses public key infrastructure-based asymmetric encryption and digital signatures to secure shared EHR data. Results: In collaboration with Stony Brook University Hospital, we developed ACTION-EHR, a system for patient-centric, blockchain-based EHR data sharing and management for patient care, in particular radiation treatment for cancer. The prototype was built on Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source, permissioned blockchain framework. Data sharing transactions were implemented using chaincode and exposed as representational state transfer application programming interfaces used for the web portal for patients and users. The HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard was adopted to represent shared EHR data, making it easy to interface with hospital EHR systems and integrate a patient's EHR data. We tested the system in a distributed environment at Stony Brook University using deidentified patient data. Conclusions: We studied and developed the critical technology components to enable patient-centric, blockchain-based EHR sharing to support cancer care. The prototype demonstrated the feasibility of our approach as well as some of the major challenges. The next step will be a pilot study with health care providers in both the United States and Switzerland. Our work provides an exemplar testbed to build next-generation EHR sharing infrastructures.","electronic health records; data sharing; blockchain; Hyperledger Fabric; privacy; security","","Dubovitskaya, A (Corresponding Author), Lucerne Univ Appl Sci & Arts, Sch Informat Technol, Suurstoffi 1, CH-6343 Rotkreuz, Switzerland.

However, due to the inherent mechanical energy consumption and the long-range signal propagation pathloss, the traditional cruising and hovering UAV relay modes are deficient in energy utilization and secrecy rate, respectively. Modeling of the secrecy energy efficiency with respect to UAV mode adaptation is limited in the literature and deserves further investigation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secrecy rate-energy efficient UAV relay mode adaptation scheme for secure wireless communications scenarios where the eavesdropping locations are known, i.e., the eavesdropper is a hijacked internal legitimate node. In this secure system, the UAV cooperatively assists the legitimate transmissions and injects artificial interference to the eavesdropper. We investigate optimum UAV placement and relay period planning for the hovering and the cruising relay modes, respectively. By modeling the UAV modes transfer and maximizing the secrecy energy efficiency, the optimum mode adaptation ratios are obtained under both the secrecy rate-prioritized and the energy-saving criteria. In addition, the proposed UAV relay mode adaptation mechanism is further studied for each UAV task division, to adapt to the dynamic channel variations and enhance the security. Our theoretical analysis shows that the mode adaptation ratio is determined by the secrecy rate-energy gain between the cruising and the hovering modes, and by the energy consumption threshold of the UAV relays. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves higher secrecy energy efficiency than the traditional schemes.","UAV; secrecy rate; energy efficiency; mode adaptation; relay","","Zhou, FH (Corresponding Author), Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China.

In many known constructions of FE schemes, security is guaranteed only for messages that are fixed ahead of time (i.e., before the adversary even interacts with the system). This so-called selective security is too restrictive for many realistic applications. Achieving adaptive security (also called full security), where security is guaranteed even for messages that are adaptively chosen at any point in time, seems significantly more challenging. The handful of known adaptively-secure schemes are based on specifically tailored techniques that rely on strong assumptions (such as obfuscation or multilinear maps assumptions). We show that any sufficiently-expressive selectively-secure FE scheme can be transformed into an adaptively-secure one without introducing any additional assumptions. We present a black-box transformation, for both public-key and private-key schemes, making novel use of hybrid encryption, a classical technique that was originally introduced for improving the efficiency of encryption schemes. We adapt the hybrid encryption approach to the setting of functional encryption via a technique for embedding a ``hidden execution thread'' in the decryption keys of the underlying scheme, which will only be activated within the proof of security of the resulting scheme. As an additional application of this technique, we show how to construct functional encryption schemes for arbitrary circuits starting from ones for shallow circuits (NC1 or even TC0).","Functional encryption; Adaptive security; Generic constructions","35th Annual International Cryptology Conference (CRYPTO), Santa Barbara, CA, AUG 16-20, 2015","Segev, G (Corresponding Author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel.

Since the total production loss from both events was quite large, some improvements have been implemented to prevent the recurrence of similar events in the future. They consist of installing the sequence of events recorder at the generator output terminal, regulating the generator lagging power factor operation from 0.95-0.99 to 0.91, adjusting the tap position to decrease the secondary voltage of the 161 kV/161 kV interconnecting transformer, operating the phase-leading capacitors attached with a multi-stage chain cut-off control unit, and running two or three generators in automatic voltage regulation mode instead of automatic power factor regulation mode. Although similar events occurred twice at the same power plant in 2006, the generating units were capable of continuous stable operation which had effectively verified the improvements of operational changes. In conclusion, we suggest that the operating modes of generators in a cogeneration plant should re-examine constantly as well as monitor power quality of different end-user sectors continuously in order to ensure the security of power-system operation.","Automatic power factor regulation; automatic voltage regulation; cogeneration power plant; generator loss-of-field","","Lee, CH (Corresponding Author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Syst & Naval Mechatron Engn, Tainan 701, Taiwan.

A three-step approach is developed to consider two offline and online environments, and the proposed scheme is designed. In Step-1, a comprehensive study of the microgrid dynamical model is investigated through two different distributed energy resources (DERs), including generator-based and inverter-based resources. In this step, based on the low-inertia concept, a dynamical model of an adaptive protection scheme is proposed through a set of non-model-based indexes. In Step-2, considering online evaluations of produced indexes, two different equations are provided in the form activation point and triggering point which the corresponding adaptive protective zones are provided. In this step, considering different operational and topological points of microgrid, the protective abilities of proposed indexes are validated and reorganized. Finally Step-3 concentrates on the ability of the proposed defensive scheme in real-time operating mode. In this step, considering different fault scenarios, the accuracy estimation and fast detection of the developed protection scheme are investigated, and the microgrid dynamic security is evaluated. Results present the effectuality of the proposed scheme to fast and secure detection of unstable scenarios using adaptive non-model-based signals concerning different system structures.

Moreover, high levels of salinity, arsenic and boron are further limiting the access to quality fresh water in many isolated communities worldwide. This paper evaluates the life cycle environmental impacts of a small multi-effect distillation (MED) plant, treating brackish water with high levels of these metalloids in an isolated location in Northern Chile. The facility currently operates solely with electricity from a diesel generator and heat from a biomass boiler. In order to evaluate the environmental impacts of more sustainable energy options, the implications of the use of solar fields and grid electricity as potential alternatives have been analysed. The results demonstrate that coupling solar fields and grid electricity is the best option, sharply decreasing impact in most categories in comparison to the current operating mode of the plant. This was attributed to the impact savings from reducing/eliminating onsite diesel and biomass combustion, and their associated transportation to the plant. For MED desalination in off-the-grid areas, the use of solar energy is highly recommended as an alternative to complement the use of diesel and biomass, especially if the latter is not nearby the unit. The concentration of arsenic and boron was reduced to below the required standards for irrigation and livestock consumption. The article concludes that the use of solar energy and grid electricity are environmentally beneficial for the production of quality fresh water from brackish water using MED at isolated communities.

Our scheme does not rely on NIZKs, and we prove that our scheme is semi-adaptively unforgeable in the standard model; that is, the adversary can announce the challenge attribute after seeing the public parameters but before launching any query. Unlike our scheme, previous approaches either construct selectively unforgeable ABS schemes in the standard model that only support attributes of a-priori bounded polynomial length, or construct adaptively unforgeable ABS schemes that support attributes of unbounded polynomial length but relying on NIZKs. We adapt an existing technique developed by Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan for constructing lattice-based semi-adaptively secure (key-policy) attribute-based encryption (ABE) with unbounded attribute length. In particular, we use the adapted technique to generate an unbounded number of matrices out of a-priori bounded public matrices in the construction and program the challenge attribute into the public matrices in our semi-adaptive security proof. Moreover, to achieve adaptive signature query in our semi-adaptive security proof, we employ the traditional partitioning technique developed in identity-based systems to encode the message to be signed. Re-using and adapting lattice-based ABE technique and partitioning technique for lattice-based ABS should not be surprising since the three settings share many features, especially their security proof ideas.","ABS; Lattices; NIZKs; ABE; SIS","","Luo, FC (Corresponding Author), Peng Cheng Lab, Dept New Networks, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.

The four methods discussed include reloading a new security database for the Security Server, expanding the state and security database of the Security Server to include more than one mode of operation, implementing another Security Server and handing off control for security computations, and implementing multiple, concurrent Security Servers each controlling a subset of processes. Each of these methods comes with a set of tradeoffs: policy flexibility, functional flexibility, security, reliability, and performance.

Traditionally, safety and security of CPEs are addressed separately, the former dealing with failures in the physical part, the latter with breaches in the cyber part. While physical aging is often accounted for, it is not for the cyber elements although it may have an impact on CPEs controllability, stability and, ultimately, reliability. In this paper, we propose a dynamic reliability assessment framework that embeds a multi-state cyber aging model of literature into a Goal Tree Success Tree-Master Logic Diagram (GTST-MLD) that accounts for both stochastic hardware components failures and cyber aging that may open breaches for cyber attacks to the control system.

The OASIS boats are extended-deployment autonomous ocean surface vehicles, whose development is funded separately by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The TAOSF architecture provides an integrated approach to multi-vehicle coordination and sliding human-vehicle autonomy. It allows multiple mobile sensing assets to function in a cooperative fashion, and the operating mode of the vessels to range from autonomous control to teleoperated control. In this manner, TAOSF increases data-gathering effectiveness and science return while reducing demands on scientists for tasking, control, and monitoring. It combines and extends prior related work done by the authors and their institutions. The TAOSF architecture is applicable to other areas where multiple sensing assets are needed, including ecological forecasting, water management, carbon management, disaster management, coastal management, homeland security, and planetary exploration. The first field application chosen for TAOSF is the characterization of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). Several components of the TAOSF system have been tested, including the OASIS boats, the communications and control interfaces between the various hardware and software subsystems, and an airborne sensor validation system. Field tests in support of future HAB characterization were performed under controlled conditions, using rhodamine dye as a HAB simulant that was dispersed in a pond.

This causes transient kind of errors and it is called subtle errors. High corruption of data in computer systems has been occurred because of these errors. Major sources of subtle errors include ionic particles, huge radiations say example alpha, beta and gamma rays, protons, neutrons etc., When TCAM configuration changes from 120 nm to 20 nm technology, there was a drastic increase in subtle errors more than multiples of eight. Devices operated in low power regions are more prone to subtle errors. Memory storage devices like secondary memory element called cache, registers are more feasible to subtle errors.(1) Behavior of subtle errors never damage circuit configuration but changes the information content leading to erroneous data. The proposed architecture is called N-SEARCH KEY TCAM, where in this system, it has been predicted that occurrence of subtle errors are very small. This innovative method of detecting and correcting both single and burst type of subtle errors has many modules like TCAM, Multiplexer, control circuit and Error correction code frame. Moreover, the proposed architecture N-SEARCH KEY ternary memory uses a special LUT for matching process. A key named Search key was generated which contains don't care bits for matching subtle errors. Unlike regular TCAM, this design uses sequential LUT which enhances matching time of order O(wnlog2n). Initially, proposed scheme have been used to find single bit subtle errors by changing forbearance factor (F) and chances of occurrence of error among TCAM information. The design was enhanced to detect multiple subtle errors and rectified the same. If match not occurs with predetermined information, then IP filter forbids the unauthorized users from using global network resources, thus providing better information security. By the proposed method, number of improper segregation ratio decreases with increase in Forbearance ratio parameter and time required to detect and correct the same is also considerably reduced. By controlling the forbearance factor F, the best duration schemes can be chosen. Through the given architecture, average time consumption for error checking of subtle errors would range from 0.6 to 0.7 mu s.","Subtle errors; N-key implementation; partial key rectification; scrubbing method; for-bearance factor; data analysis; information retrieval; TCAM information systems","","Sakthi, K (Corresponding Author), Saveetha Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

Mutual support and co-operation among nodes are prerequisites for performing functions in such networks. The scarcity of resources makes it economical for nodes to conserve their resources and misbehave by avoiding participation in the network. Therefore, a mechanism is required to detect and handle such misbehaving nodes and promote co-operation in the network. Existing techniques for handling misbehaving nodes focus only on their current behaviour without considering the antecedent behaviour of nodes. In real world, a node may dynamically change its behaviour in accordance to its requirements. Hence, an efficient mechanism is required for providing security against such misbehaviour. This paper proposes an Adaptive Security Model which contemplates the present as well as anterior behaviour of nodes for providing security against dynamic node behaviour. The adaptivity of the model is nested in its ability to requite well-behaving nodes and penalize misbehaving ones in conformity with their overall behaviour.

Consequently, this paper presents an approach to evaluate the impacts of the HVDC link outage on the reliability of interconnected power system considering the frequency regulation process during system contingencies. Firstly, a multi-state model of an HVDC link with different available loading rates (ALRs) is established based on its reliability network. Then, dynamic frequency response models of the inter- connected power system are presented and integrated with a novel frequency regulation scheme enabled by the HVDC link. The proposed scheme exploits the temporary overload capability of normal converters to compensate for the imbalanced power during system contingencies. Moreover, it offers frequency support that enables the frequency regulation reserves of the sending-end and receiving-end power systems to be mutually available. Several indices are established to measure the system reliability based on the given models in terms of abnormal frequency duration, frequency deviation, and energy losses of the frequency regulation process during system contingencies.

However, pump turbines go through the unstable S region in these transition processes, threatening the security and stability of the pumped storage station. This issue has mainly been investigated through numerical simulations, while field experiments generally involve high risks and are difficult to perform. Therefore, in this work, the model test method was employed to study S-induced security and stability issues for a pumped storage station in transition processes. First, a pumped storage system model was set up, including the piping system, model units, electrical control systems and measurement system. In this model, two pump turbines with different S-shaped characteristics were installed to determine the influence of S-shaped characteristics on transition processes. The model platform can be applied to simulate any hydraulic transition process that occurs in real power stations, such as load rejection, startup, and grid connection. On the experimental platform, the S-shaped characteristic curves were measured to be the basis of other experiments. Runaway experiments were performed to verify the impact of the S-shaped characteristics on the pump turbine runaway stability. Full load rejection tests were performed to validate the effect of the S-shaped characteristics on the water-hammer pressure. The condition of one pump turbine rejecting its load after another defined as one-after-another (OAA) load rejection was performed to validate the possibility of S-induced extreme draft tube pressure. Load rejection experiments with different guide vane closing schemes were performed to determine a suitable scheme to adapt the S-shaped characteristics. Through these experiments, the threats existing in the station were verified, the appropriate measures were summarized, and an important experimental basis for the safe and stable operation of a pumped storage station was provided.

Therefore, it is necessary to constantly find solutions to the problem of priorities when choosing level crossings where it is necessary to raise the level of security, primarily by analyzing the risk and reliability at all level crossings. This paper presents a model that enables this. The calculation of the maximal risk of a level crossing is achieved under the conditions of generating the maximum entropy in the virtual operating mode. The basis of the model is a heterogeneous queuing system. Maximum entropy is based on the mandatory application of an exponential distribution. The system is Markovian and is solved by a standard analytical concept. The basic input parameters for the calculation of the maximal risk are the geometric characteristics of the level crossing and the intensities and structure of the flows of road and railway vehicles. The real risk is based on statistical records of accidents and flow intensities. The exact reliability of the level crossing is calculated from the ratio of real and maximal risk, which enables their further comparison in order to raise the level of safety, and that is the basic idea of this paper.","risk; reliability; level crossings; queueing theory; accident; entropy","","Kopic, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.

With two-thirds of Australia's population already residing in these growing major cities, urban water resources pressure will undoubtedly increase in the years ahead. Methods to augment traditional reservoir based water supply will be required to maintain water security. Internally plumbed rain water tank systems (IPRWTs), supplying water at a decentralised level, are one potential alternate supply source. Incentive schemes and legislation have seen IPRWTs become increasingly prevalent in metropolitan areas since widespread drought from 2000-2009. For example in Queensland water savings targets were mandated for all newly constructed homes. The most common means of meeting these targets was through the use of IPRWTs, which when installed were required to supply garden irrigation, clothes-washers and cistern flush events. Studies to date have been focused on maximising potable savings, such that little research has investigated the energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the operation of IPRWTs. This is a worthy consideration given that they are typically thought of as green, sustainable solutions. This paper examines the energy intensity and greenhouse gas cost of IPRWTs under a number of modelled usage scenarios, utilising high-resolution end-use level data from a recently conducted IPRWT monitoring study in South East Queensland. This modelling, facilitated through the use of specialised software, MATLAB and spread-sheet software, has determined the average annual energy consumption of IPRWTs, taking into account the effect of climatic conditions on water consumption. This energy consumption leads to electricity and carbon based costs to homeowners and the general community, which have been quantified at an end-use level. In the interests of system optimisation, the net economic and environmental impacts of configuration changes to IPRWTs have been considered, such as not plumbing in toilet cisterns. For standard 2.8 person households preliminary evidence indicates that based only on operational costs, more end-uses are preferable, due to higher yields. However, when plumbing and environmental costs are taken into account it has been found that it may be worthwhile to plumb in only the most energy efficient rainwater end-uses (irrigation and clothes washing). For larger households, or those consuming large volumes of water in regular irrigation, energy intensity of water supply can be significantly lowered by only plumbing in efficient end-uses, while yearly water savings (from avoided mains costs) fall only by a small margin. For retrofitters and new home builders the extra cost incurred when plumbing in toilet cisterns to rainwater supply should be considered. Existing system owners should note the large increase in system energy intensity when small leaks develop from poor maintenance, usually from toilet cisterns, as this can lead to significantly greater economic and environmental costs over the lifetime of a rainwater system and reduce the viability of cistern end-uses.","Rainwater tanks; energy intensity; water supply systems; greenhouse gas emissions","20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM), Adelaide, AUSTRALIA, DEC 01-06, 2013","Siems, R (Corresponding Author), Griffith Univ, Ctr Infrastruct Engn & Management, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.

From a functional perspective, dependability assumes satisfying some of the required functions and implies the correct definition of them. Thus, in the case of complex equipment, multi-variable functions can be generated whose variables are dependent on different states and operating modes. In recent years, automated continuous design techniques have been developed through intelligent computational methodologies to determine the dependability of systems. These techniques also introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) in integrity engineering design and offer an overview and modelling in designing for reliability, availability, maintainability and system security. This paper combines quantitative research, mathematical and algorithmic modelling with evolutionary techniques. The combination of the four research techniques is done in a coherent application validated on a mechanical device and applicable to a wide range of technical systems. More specifically, the work proposes a comparative study of mathematical - linear and nonlinear models for correlation and optimization of maintainability and reliability values in relation to production and quality policies. These models will be complemented with specific AI techniques: neural and genetic algorithms that validate and optimize mathematical models. It identifies the metrics for the evaluation of the dependent variables (reliability, maintainability) and an independent variables (production and quality), these variables are observed over a given time horizon, their mathematical, neural and genetic modelling is performed to achieve correlations, optimization functions and model validation.

The special feature of these is the designing for operation in two modes: normal and emergency. Digital components can accumulate hidden failures over a long-term normal mode. This reduces their fault tolerance and functional safety of the system in the most responsible emergency mode. Two conditions for occurrence of the hidden fault problem as a growth one are considered in view of a resource approach, which in the development of models, methods and means highlights levels of replication and diversification. Safety-related systems are analyzed as computer systems that have increased to the level of diversification to address the security challenge. Their components are still stamped at a level of resource replication using matrix structures to process data in parallel codes. Fault-tolerant solutions become fault-safe with a sufficient level of circuit checkability, which is commonly known as testability, i.e. structural checkability, depending only on the structure of the circuit. In the operating mode, the checkability becomes structurally-functional, and in critical applications it is converted into a dual-mode, the shortage of which causes the hidden fault problem. A method of analyzing circuits for the possibility of hidden faults is suggested. The method is illustrated on example of an iterative array multiplier implemented in an FPGA project with a LUT-oriented architecture. A program model for the resulting scheme has been developed and potentially dangerous points have been found in it in which the hidden fault problem of may manifest itself.","hidden fault; FPGA; LUT-oriented architecture; safety-related system; digital component; growth problem, resource approach, replication, diversification, matrix structure, checkability; iterative array multiplier; potentially dangerous points","15th International Conference on Advanced Trends in Radioelectronics, Telecommunications and Computer Engineering (TCSET), Lviv, UKRAINE, FEB 25-29, 2020","Drozd, O (Corresponding Author), Odesa Natl Polytech Univ, Inst Comp Syst, Odesa, Ukraine.

Although recent studies have explored the quantification of system resilience, there has been limited research aimed at understanding the role of multiple performance measures, spatiotemporal heterogeneities, and modeling uncertainties within the assessment of resilience and associated decision-making. Under real-world conditions, there is an increased burden on analysts for translating observed system data (including human and electronic sensor observations) into system performance estimates that may not be directly observable. This paper addresses these issues using a scenario-based risk modeling approach to understand: (1) resilience of complex systems, often in cases of hidden (not readily observable) measures of performance, (2) resilience sensitivity to modeling uncertainties in event and system characteristics, and (3) resilience sensitivity to the measurement of performance across multiple operational perspectives. The methods in this paper integrate uncertainty-driven risk and probabilistic modeling within a multi-state Markov-based approach. This study contributes to the state-of-the-art by developing methodologies for assessing community perceptions of infrastructure system resilience using observable factors and inferring possibly hidden performance measures for facilitating adaptive decision-support. The methods are demonstrated with hypothetical spatiotemporal data across multiple system performance dimensions. The analysis results are useful for infrastructure security analysts, system decision-makers, and the general public.","Infrastructure system resilience; risk management; decision support; Markov models","","Thekdi, SA (Corresponding Author), Univ Richmond, Robins Sch Business, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.

Recent works [17], [33], [34] pointed out that directly adopting the CPU secure memory design to GPUs could incur significant performance overheads due to the memory bandwidth contention between regular data and security metadata. In this paper, we analyze the security guarantees that used to defend against physical attacks, and make the observation that heterogeneous GPU memory system may not always need all the security mechanisms to achieve the security guarantees. Based on the memory types as well as memory access patterns either explicitly specified in the GPU programming model or implicitly detected at run time, we propose adaptive security memory support for heterogeneous memory on GPUs. Specifically, we first identify the read-only data and propose to only use MAC (Message Authentication Code) to protect their integrity. By eliminating the freshness checks on read-only data, we can use an on-chip shared counter for such data regions and remove the corresponding parts in the Bonsai Merkel Tree (BMT), thereby reducing the traffic due to encryption counters and the BMT. Second, we detect the common streaming data access pattern and propose coarsegrain MACs for such stream data to reduce the MAC access bandwidth. With the hardware-based detection of memory type (read-only or not) and memory access patterns (streaming or not), our proposed approach adapts the security support to significantly reduce the performance overhead without sacrificing the security guarantees. Our evaluation shows that our scheme can achieve secure memory on GPUs with low overheads for memory-intensive workloads. Among the fifteen memory-intensive workloads in our evaluation, our design reduces the performance overheads of secure GPU memory from 53.9% to 8.09% on average. Compared to the state-of-the-art secure memory designs for GPU [17], [33], our scheme outperforms PSSM by up to 41.63% and 9.5% on average and outperforms Common counters by 84.04% on average for memory-intensive workloads. We further propose to use the L2 cache as a victim cache for security metadata when the L2 is either underutilized or suffers from very high miss rates, which further reduces the overheads by up to 4% and 0.65% on average.","GPUs; secure memory; heterogeneous memory; encryption; integrity check; security metadata cache","28th Annual IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA), ELECTR NETWORK, APR 02-06, 2022","Yuan, SG (Corresponding Author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.

One of its most valuable features is its threat detection function which is available on every version of the firewall running a software version of 8.0(2) or higher. Threat detection operates at layers 3 and 4 to determine a baseline for network traffic, analysing packet drop statistics and generating threat reports based on traffic patterns. Despite producing a large volume of statistical information relating to several security events, further effort is required to mine and visually report more significant information and conclude the security status of the network. There are several commercial off-the-shelf tools available to undertake this task, however, they are expensive and may require a cloud subscription. Furthermore, if the information transmitted over the network is sensitive or requires confidentiality, the involvement of a third party or a third-party tool may place organisational security at risk. Therefore, this paper presents a fuzzy logic aided intelligent threat detection solution, which is a cost-free, intuitive and comprehensible solution, enhancing and simplifying the threat detection process for all. In particular, it employs a fuzzy reasoning system based on the threat detection statistics, and presents results/threats through a developed dashboard user interface, for ease of understanding for administrators and users. The paper further demonstrates the successful utilisation of a fuzzy reasoning system for selected and prioritised security events in basic threat detection, although it can be extended to encompass more complex situations, such as complete basic threat detection, advanced threat detection, scanning threat detection, and customised feature based threat detection.","","IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL, JUL 08-13, 2018","Naik, N (Corresponding Author), Minist Def, Def Sch Commun & Informat Syst, Blandford Camp, England.

But operating conditions within this domain strongly favour malicious actors over legitimate operators seeking to provide security and protect systems and information. Technical capabilities to establish dominance and cause damage in this domain are widely distributed, but legal and ethical constraints prevent legitimate actors from using them to their full potential. Within this context, net neutrality presents a limiting factor on the capability of legitimate actors to respond to harmful activity in cyber space whose common aim is to install and uphold a technical imbalance. Under the principle of net neutrality. each data packet must be transmitted with equal priority, irrespective of its source, destination, content or purpose. This is disadvantageous to cyber defence. Comparisons to jungle or arctic warfare, where operating conditions are neutral and degrade the performance of each combatant side equally, arc invalid, as malicious operators arc capable of technically manipulating data traffic to their favour. While both malicious and legitimate actors may have comparable capabilities, legitimate actors are bound to legal and political restrictions, making them immobile in several cyber warfare scenarios. Transferring the principles of net neutrality to real life scenarios corresponds to depriving military, police and emergency operators from any privilege that allows them to respond to an incident - in effect, depriving them of their blue lights and emergency powers even in severe incidents targeting critical infrastructure that may threaten civilian lives. This paper investigates the potential opportunities and challenges of an adjustment to the principle of net neutrality to facilitate defensive action by legitimate actors; how this adjustment could contribute to regaining control in congested cyber domains in the case of national or international cyber incidents; and the risks associated. The different ways of dealing with net neutrality in cyber defence situations in the EU, UK and Russia are compared. Particular focus is put on the organisations and capabilities needed to establish technical sovereignty in multi-domain networks, including consideration of the acceptability of out sourcing the task of upholding cyber sovereignty to external institutions.","net neutrality; cyber defence; cyber security; net regulation","10th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon) - Maximising Effects, Tallinn, ESTONIA, MAY 30-JUN 01, 2018","Hartmann, K (Corresponding Author), Conflict Studies Res Ctr, Oxford, England.

Without such progress, these concerns may be limiting factors in the exploitation of this vital resource. ``Convert-and-burn'' fast reactors offer the potential for advances in each of these areas without the specter of increased proliferation risk that accompanies breeder reactor concepts. An example is Energy Multiplier Module (EM2), a compact, helium-cooled fast reactor that augments its fissile fuel load with either depleted uranium or used nuclear fuel (UNF). The convert-and-burn in situ operating mode results in a core predicted to last 30 years without the need to add or shuffle fuel. EM2 can endure a station blackout, even one combined with a loss-of-coolant accident, using only passive safety systems to prevent radio-activity release or loss of plant. The end-of-cycle fuel and/or light water reactor UNF can be refabricated in a manner that does not separate out heavy metal, permitting reuse in subsequent generations at reduced proliferation risk. Proliferation resistance is further enhanced by eliminating the need for enrichment beyond that needed for the first-generation fuel load. Waste problems are mitigated by several factors: higher burnup, fuel use in multiple generations, and conversion of existing waste to energy. Economically attractive power costs are anticipated through a combination of high efficiency, simplicity of the direct-cycle gas turbine, and relatively small subsystems that can be shop fabricated and shipped by road to the site. Reactor materials have been carefully chosen to achieve a safe, economically affordable, and proliferation-resistant energy source.","gas-cooled fast reactor; small moduler reactor; depleted uranium","","Choi, H (Corresponding Author), Gen Atom Co, POB 85608, San Diego, CA 92186 USA.

Inside AIRBUS Defence & Space, the focus on X-band antennas today is on airborne and fighter nose radars, in satellite based SAR antennas (synthetic aperture radar) for earth observation, and ground surveillance and security radars. Active airborne antennas are assembled with hundreds or even thousands of transmit/receive modules. This paper will describe the evolution of the so-called standardized module solution based on LTCC package technology with special regard to airborne applications and the correlated needs. This evolution especially contains significant optimization steps concerning area, weight and cost. By realization of an SMTR (R) Module suitable to a folded plank concept a significant reduction of installation depth could be achieved. As the module weight is dominated by its package, technology evaluation and implementation of advantageous concepts and materials was performed, here. Cost reduction is always a key focus of T/R module evolution as the modules still allocate a big part of antenna's production cost. Some steps have been realised here both on technology and component level. The next generation of AESA antennas will result in a combination of different operating modes within the same antenna front end, including radar, communication (data links), and jamming (electronic warfare, EW). This leads to enhanced demands especially towards the MMICs. The RF section of today's T/R modules for AESA applications is typically based on GaAs technology. During the last 10 years there was much progress in the development of disruptive semiconductor materials, especially GaN and SiGe BiCMOS, which have the potential to challenge or even replace the GaAs technology, here. This paper will describe and show this evolution through the last years and shall give an outlook towards future developments with regard to airborne applications.","T/R Module; AESA; X-Band; Airborne","International Radar Conference, Lille, FRANCE, OCT 13-17, 2014","Rieger, R (Corresponding Author), AIRBUS Def & Space, TR Modules, Ulm, Germany.

This paper presents a typology that categorizes where agricultural production and distribution of a specific geographic area, in this case a multi-state region, fits within the US food system. The place of each food is defined based on its production volume, scope of distribution, market timing and agro-ecological niche. Six distinct roles that a region might play in supplying food are identified: (a) the region is a national production center, (b) the region is a seasonally important supplier, (c) regional production and distribution is the primary scale for supplying a food, (d) the product occupies an agro-ecological niche, (e) a product is a co-product of another industry in the region, and (f) the product is marketed explicitly for its geographic provenance as a local or regional product. Illustrative examples of each role are provided from the research of the Enhancing Food Security in the Northeast (EFSNE) regional food systems project. The examples draw from a variety of methodological approaches including regional self-reliance analysis, product case studies, supply chain models, and examination of spatial and temporal patterns in crop and livestock production and marketing. While presented in the context of the Northeast, the typology would likely be valuable for characterizing other regions of the country.

To date the main paradigm for achieving adaptive security in ABE is dual system encryption. However, almost all such solutions in bilinear groups rely on (variants of) either the subgroup decision problem over composite order groups or the decision linear assumption. Both of these assumptions are decisional rather than search assumptions and the target of the assumption is a source or bilinear group element. This is in contrast to earlier selectively secure ABE systems which can be proven secure from either the decisional or search Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption. In this work we make progress on closing this gap by giving a new ABE construction for the subset functionality and prove security under the Search Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption. We first provide a framework for proving adaptive security in Attribute-Based Encryption systems. We introduce a concept of ABE with deletable attributes where any party can take a ciphertext encrypted under the attribute string x is an element of \{0, 1\}(n) and modify it into a ciphertext encrypted under any string x is an element of \{0, 1 perpendicular to\}(n) where x' is derived by replacing any bits of x with perpendicular to symbols (i.e. ``deleting'' attributes of x). The semantics of the system are that any private key for a circuit C can be used to decrypt a ciphertext associated with x' if none of the input bits read by circuit C are perpendicular to symbols and C(x') = 1. We show a pathway for combining ABE with deletable attributes with constrained pseudorandom functions to obtain adaptively secure ABE building upon the recent work of Tsabary [30]. Our new ABE system will be adaptively secure and be a ciphertext-policy ABE that supports the same functionality as the underlying constrained PRF as long as the PRF is ``deletion conforming''. Here we also provide a simple constrained PRF construction that gives subset functionality. Our approach enables us to access a broader array of Attribute-Based Encryption schemes support deletion of attributes. For example, we show that both the Goyal et al. (GPSW) [19] and Boyen [6] ABE schemes can trivially handle a deletion operation. And, by using a hardcore bit variant of GPSW scheme we obtain an adaptively secure ABE scheme under the Search Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in addition to pseudo random functions in NC1. This gives the first adaptively secure ABE from a search assumption as all prior work relied on decision assumptions over source group elements.","","27th Annual International Conference on Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security, ELECTR NETWORK, DEC 06-10, 2021","Goyal, R (Corresponding Author), MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.

In the past five years, total medical and health expenditure growth rate is much higher than GDP growth rate. Faced with rising medical costs, more and more people choose to purchase insurance to reduce their health risks probability. Social health insurance covers widely and provides the most basic health care; commercial health insurance has features such as flexible buying terms, high level of security, diverse choices and so on. From international experience, we learn that governments around the world are committed to building a multi-level medical security system, our country is no exception. In January 2009, Executive meeting of the State Council adopted a project on Deepening Medical Health System Reform, which indicates the beginning of a new round of medical care reform. The project proposed to construct a medical care system with basic health care as the main body and other health insurance as supplement. Chinese scholars studying the cohesion between social health insurance and commercial health insurance are mainly based on qualitative research, and their researches are focused on the theoretical analysis or comparative study about foreign operate mode. This paper analyzes and confirms the feasible cohesion using quantitative method. Firstly, the dissertation describes the policy framework of new medical system reform and its effects to health insurances. Then based on data from CHARLS (China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study), the paper analyzes the correlation between social insurance and health insurance needs under the New Medical System Reform, using insurance requirements model, cross-analysis theory and multiple linear regression analysis. Negative correlation suggests that health insurance is complementary to the coverage, residents choose one between social medical insurance and health insurance; positive correlation is shown to be complementary to the depth of insurance, and residents participating in social medical insurance buy extra commercial health insurance to shift more risk. Empirical analysis shows that social health insurance promotes commercial health insurance virtually, whose effect is related to average income of family. The results confirm that the cohesion between social health insurance and commercial health insurance is feasible. Thirdly, on account of previous analysis and realities, the dissertation provides appropriate ways to build the cohesion between them. Lastly, the paper gives its conclusion and advice from product innovation, professional management and other aspects.","Social health insurance; Commercial health insurance; Cohesion; insurance requirements model; cross-analysis theory","7th China International Conference on Insurance and Risk Management (CICIRM), Xian Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA, JUL 27-30, 2016","Qu, Y (Corresponding Author), Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.

Moreover, other important factors of AVs' operating mode (e.g., response time and detection regression) are usually underestimated. Ignoring such factors create an ``understanding gap'' on the effectiveness of AVs in actual scenarios, which we aim to bridge by presenting a broader characterization of current AVs' modes of operation.

To do so, we daily collected samples from two distinct, representative malware sources and submitted them to the VirusTotal (VT) service for 30 consecutive days. In total, we considered 28,875 unique malware samples. For each day, we retrieved the submitted samples' detection rates and assigned labels, resulting in more than 1M distinct VT submissions overall. Our experimental results show that: (i) phishing contexts are a challenge for all AVs, turning malicious Web pages detectors less effective than malicious files detectors; (ii) generic procedures are insufficient to ensure broad detection coverage, incurring in lower detection rates for particular datasets (e.g., country-specific) than for those with world-wide collected samples; (iii) detection rates are unstable since all AVs presented detection regression effects after scans in different time frames using the same dataset and (iv) AVs' long response times in delivering new signatures/heuristics create a significant attack opportunity window within the first 30 days after we first identified a malicious binary. To address the effects of our findings, we propose six new metrics to evaluate the multiple aspects that impact the effectiveness of AVs. With them, we hope to assess corporate (and domestic) users to better evaluate the solutions that fit their needs more adequately. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Secure OS based on Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the systems that reflect these techniques. The RBAC system controls access to system resources based on roles. Recently, many systems employ more fine-grained access control on system resources to enhance system security. However, this approach in access control level may cause unexpected problems, since most systems acquire system resources through system call that is hooked on kernel. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The proposed Autonomic Protection System (APS) supports fine-grained intrusion detection. It resides above Secure OS based on RBAC that provides general-grained access control. The system detects intrusions using security policy based on RBAC model. The system performs double checking for intrusions using positive and negative intrusion detection policy. Additionally, as one of active responses, the system supports the self-adaptation of security policy depending on various computing environments. Therefore, the system can detect intrusions more accurately and respond to the attacks actively and appropriately.","","International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA 2004), Assisi, ITALY, MAY 14-17, 2004","Kim, W (Corresponding Author), Sejong Univ, Coll Elect & Inormat Engn, Seoul 143747, South Korea.

The ultimate goal of an IDPS system is to stop security attacks before they have been carried successfully. This paper proposed an efficient network-based IDPS System which takes multiple counteractions against network attacks. The proposed system's first reaction after detecting malicious packets is to generate an alert and log them; if the number of packets goes beyond threshold limit in one second, the second counteraction takes place to block the attackers IP address through firewall. Finally, if the system fails to block these packets, the third counteraction takes place to remotely stop the corresponding service.

To support the high quality of service (QoS) requirements of the involved communication tasks, one solution is to rely on multi-mode (i.e., acoustic, optical, magnetic induction (MI), and radio frequency (RF)) communication systems. Such a multi-mode communication system can take advantage of the complementary modes' features, to obtain QoS requirements per transmission flow. However, challenges including high system cost and coordination between different modes need to be addressed. Therefore, in this paper a Universal Underwater Software Defined Radio ( UniSDR) architecture is proposed that realizes joint operation of different modes, in order to deal with the latest use cases demands. Detailed description of the UniSDR architecture is presented. Novelty of the architecture provides flexibility, allowing designer to build a radio that includes any set of modes, which can operate jointly by exchanging data, control and synchronization.

With its ingrained islanding capability, a microgrid can operate in isolation from the main grid while still keeping its load supplied for enhanced reliability and supply security. These microgrids represent the building block for future smart distribution systems. For steady-state studies of this type of isolated operating mode, an accurate, fast, scalable, efficient power flow analysis tool is crucial. Conventional power flow analysis face challenges when applied to isolated microgrids such as singularity results from system radiality, high R/X ratio, relatively small rated distributed generation (DG) units and thus absence of conventional slack bus, extensive computational burden, convergence issues and extensive solution time. Although branch-based power flow techniques are more preferred for distribution systems to overcome some of the aforementioned challenges, these techniques are incompatible with isolated microgrids as they necessitate the availability of a slack bus. This paper presents a novel branch-based methodology based on the use of power sweeps to solve the steady-state power flow problem. The proposed forward-return-forward-backward sweep (FR-FBS) includes Consideration of inherent isolated microgrid characteristics, such as its variable frequency and the absence of a slack bus. The proposed approach also incorporates practical operating mddes for DG units and a variety of load characteristics. In addition, the inversion-fred nature and consequent speed of the algorithm avoid excessive computational time, thus making it suitable for large distribution networks. The proposed algorithm has been applied to test systems and the obtained results were compared to those obtained with time-domain simulations as well as newton trusted region load flow method. In addition, the effect of load changing on micrgrid's voltage profile and power sharing among different DGs were studied. The results show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. This tool therefore offers support for online energy management, self-healing applications, and emerging techniques for clustering power systems into adaptive self-adequate microgrids.

Challenges include heterogeneity of hardware, software, and communication protocols, variability of resource limitations and varying wireless channel quality. In this scenario, security becomes a major concern for mobile users and applications. Security requirements for each application are different, as well as the hardware capabilities of each device. To make things worse, wireless medium conditions may change dramatically with time, incurring great impact on performance and QoS guarantees for the application. Currently, most of the security solutions for mobile devices use a static set of algorithms and protocols for services such as cryptography and hashes. In this work we propose a security service, which works as a middleware, with the ability to dynamically change the security protocols used between two peers. These changes can occur based on variations on wireless medium parameters and system resource usage, available hardware resources, application-defined QoS metrics, and desired data ``security levels''. We compare our solution to some widespread static security protocols, demonstrate how our middleware is able to adapt itself over different conditions of medium and system, and how it can provide a performance gain in the execution of cryptographic primitives, through the use of data semantics.

Design/methodology/approach - The methodology adopted in this paper is based on a combined contingency analysis/reliability evaluation scheme. A three-component system model is utilized, which can be used effectively for evaluation and sensitivity analysis of reliability and quality in power systems. The model is a reduced (equivalent) system representation that comprises generation, transmission and load components with multi-state values. The computational scheme presented in the paper integrates both the contingency effect and its probability of occurrence into one routine of analysis while reducing the power system around the region of interest. Findings - The computational scheme presented in the paper can effectively assess both service reliability and system quality. The practical applications presented demonstrated that lower service reliability levels would jeopardize energy supply continuity and increase the likelihood of additional maintenance and restoration costs due to the resulting higher rate of system outages. Poor system quality levels, on the other hand, imply either deficiency or excess in the overall system capabilities as designed by its planners.

There is evidence that global warming over the last millennium has already resulted in increased global average annual temperature and changes in rainfall, with the 1990s being likely the warmest decade in the Northern Hemisphere at least. During the past century, changes in temperature patterns have, for example, had a direct impact on the number of frost days and the length of growing seasons with significant implications for agriculture and forestry. Land cover changes, changes in global ocean circulation and sea surface temperature patterns, and changes in the composition of the global atmosphere are leading to changes in rainfall. These changes may be more pronounced in the tropics. For example, crop varieties grown in the Sahel may not be able to withstand the projected warming trends and will certainly be at risk due to projected lower amounts of rainfall as well. Seasonal to interannual climate forecasts will definitely improve in the future with a better understanding of dynamic relationships. However, the main issue at present is how to make better use of the existing information and dispersion of knowledge to the farm level. Direct participation by the farming communities in pilot projects on agrometeorological services will be essential to determine the actual value of forecasts and to better identify the specific user needs. Old (visits, extension radio) and new (internet) communication techniques, when adapted to local applications, may assist in the dissemination of useful information to the farmers and decision makers. Some farming systems with an inherent resilience may adapt more readily to climate pressures, making long-term adjustments to varying and changing conditions. Other systems will need interventions for adaptation that should be more strongly supported by agrometeorological services for agricultural producers. This applies, among others, to systems where pests and diseases play an important role. Scientists have to guide policy makers in fostering an environment in which adaptation strategies can be effected. There is a clear need for integrating preparedness for climate variability and climate change. In developed countries, a trend of higher yields, but with greater annual fluctuations and changes in cropping patterns and crop calendars can be expected with changing climate scenarios. Shifts in projected cropping patterns can be disruptive to rural societies in general. However, developed countries have the technology to adapt more readily to the projected climate changes. In many developing countries, the present conditions of agriculture and forestry are already marginal, due to degradation of natural resources, the use of inappropriate technologies and other stresses. For these reasons, the ability to adapt will be more difficult in the tropics and subtropics and in countries in transition. Food security will remain a problem in many developing countries. Nevertheless, there are many examples of traditional knowledge, indigenous technologies and local innovations that can be used effectively as a foundation for improved frming systems. Before developing adaptation strategies, it is essential to learn from the actual difficulties faced by farmers to cope with risk management at the farm level. Agrometeorologists must play an important role in assisting farmers with the development of feasible strategies to adapt to climate variability and climate change. Agrometeorologists should also advise national policy makers on the urgent need to cope with the vulnerabilities of agriculture and forestry to climate variability and climate change. The workshop recommendations were largely limited to adaptation. Adaptation to the adverse effects of climate variability and climate change is of high priority for nearly all countries, but developing countries are particularly vulnerable. Effective measures to cope with vulnerability and adaptation need to be developed at all levels. Capacity building must be integrated into adaptation measures for sustainable agricultural development strategies. Consequently, nations must develop strategies that effectively focus on specific regional issues to promote sustainable development.","","International Workshop on Reducing Vulnerability of Agriculture and Forestry to Climate Variability and Climate Change, Ljubljana, SLOVENIA, OCT-MAY -, 2002-2003","Salinger, MJ (Corresponding Author), Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, POB 109-695, Auckland, New Zealand.

Systematic approaches to measure cybersecurity are needed in order to support efficient construction and maintenance of secure software systems. Security measurement of software architectures is needed to produce sufficient evidence of security level as early as in the design phase. Design-time security measuring should support ``security by design'' approach. Moreover, software architectures have to support runtime security measurement to obtain up-to-date security information from an online software system, service or product. Security metrics and measurements are exploited in situational awareness monitoring and self-adaptive security solutions. The area of security metrics and security assurance metrics research is evolving, but still lacks widely accepted metrics definitions and applicable measuring techniques.

IIoT establishes an enterprise-to-enterprise setup that means industries have several factories and manufacturing units that are dependent on other sectors for their services and products. In this context, individual industries need to share their information with other external sectors in a shared environment which may not be secure. The capability to examine and inspect such large-scale information and perform analytical protection over the large volumes of personal and organizational information demands authentication and confidentiality so that the total data are not endangered after illegal access by hackers and other unauthorized persons. In parallel, these large volumes of confidential industrial data need to be processed within reasonable time for effective deliverables. Currently, there are many mathematical-based symmetric and asymmetric key cryptographic approaches and identity- and attribute-based public key cryptographic approaches that exist to address the abovementioned concerns and limitations such as computational overheads and taking more time for crucial generation as part of the encipherment and decipherment process for large-scale data privacy and security. In addition, the required key for the encipherment and decipherment process may be generated by a third party which may be compromised and lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, brute force attacks, etc. In parallel, there are some other quantum key distribution approaches available to produce keys for the encipherment and decipherment process without the need for a third party. However, there are still some attacks such as photon number splitting attacks and faked state attacks that may be possible with these existing QKD approaches. The primary motivation of our work is to address and avoid such abovementioned existing problems with better and optimal computational overhead for key generation, encipherment, and the decipherment process compared to the existing conventional models. To overcome the existing problems, we proposed a novel dynamic quantum key distribution (QKD) algorithm for critical public infrastructure, which will secure all cyber-physical systems as part of IIoT. In this paper, we used novel multi-state qubit representation to support enhanced dynamic, chaotic quantum key generation with high efficiency and low computational overhead. Our proposed QKD algorithm can create a chaotic set of qubits that act as a part of session-wise dynamic keys used to encipher the IIoT-based large scales of information for secure communication and distribution of sensitive information.","chaotic key generator; cybersecurity; IIoT; novel dynamic quantum key distribution algorithm; 5G","","Muhammad, G (Corresponding Author), King Saud Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Comp Engn Dept, Res Chair New Emerging Technol & 5G Networks &, Riyadh 11543, Saudi Arabia.

In MDA, the reusability of models is improved as well as the traceability of requirements. Agent-oriented model-driven architecture (AMDA) associates adaptive agents with a business-oriented interaction model and lets agents dynamically interpret their behaviour from the continuously maintained model via which the current business needs are deployed at runtime. The continuous re-interpretation rather than discrete re-transformation of models means immediate requirements deployment after re-configuration, no system down time being required to affect changes and results in a development process that is oriented to business experts rather than developers. Adopting the adaptive agent model, an AMDA paradigm, we put forward a security-aware model-driven mechanism by using an extension of the role-based access control (RBAC) model. For this purpose, the concept or agent role proposed in agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) is integrated with the one proposed in RBAC. Agent duties are specified in an interaction model and describe the roles that agents can play to fulfil their functional responsibilities. Agent rights are specified in a security policy rule model attached to the interaction model and describe constraints upon agent capabilities caused by their associated social roles. The role based interaction and policy-driven model incorporates both agent rights and duties. Hence, functional requirements and non-functional security constraint requirements are put together, related by the concept of role. Consequently, agents can continuously use the re-configurable model to play their roles in order to fulfil their responsibilities, and at the same time respect the security constraints. The major contribution from the approach is a method for building adaptive and secure MAS, following model-driven architecture. The approach is illustrated with an actual British railway management system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Secure systems provide capabilities that enable such protection to satisfy some security requirements. In a world increasingly populated with mobile and ubiquitous computing technology, the scope and boundary of security systems can be uncertain and can change. A single functional component, or even multiple components individually, are often insufficient to satisfy complex security requirements on their own. Adaptive security aims to enable systems to vary their protection in the face of changes in their operational environment. Collaborative security, which we propose in this paper, aims to exploit the selection and deployment of multiple, potentially heterogeneous, software-intensive components to collaborate in order to meet security requirements in the face of changes in the environment, changes in assets under protection and their values, and the discovery of new threats and vulnerabilities. However, the components that need to collaborate may not have been designed and implemented to interact with one another collaboratively. To address this, we propose a novel framework for collaborative security that combines adaptive security, collaborative adaptation and an explicit representation of the capabilities of the software components that may be needed in order to achieve collaborative security. We elaborate on each of these framework elements, focusing in particular on the challenges and opportunities afforded by (1) the ability to capture, represent, and reason about the capabilities of different software components and their operational context, and (2) the ability of components to be selected and mediated at runtime in order to satisfy the security requirements. We illustrate our vision through a collaborative robotic implementation, and suggest some areas for future work.","Security requirements; mediation; collaborative adaptation","9th International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS), Hyderabad, INDIA, JUN 02-03, 2014","Bennaceur, A (Corresponding Author), Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England.

In critical systems, it is not always the best or practical thing to do to shut down the network under attack. In this paper we describe how trust in cyber assets can be modeled and used to support self-adaptive techniques in continuing to operate important computational functions in a network that is actively under attack. The paper, in particular describes the trust modeling system that attempts to maintain a model of trust for networked resources using a combination of two basic ideas: Conditional trust (based on conditional preference (CP-Nets) and the principle of maximum entropy (PME).","","6th IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems Workshops (SASO), Lyon, FRANCE, SEP 10-14, 2012","","English","International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems"

The attribute-based signature scheme can be seen as an extension of Schnorr signatures, with adaptive security relying on the discrete logarithm assumption, in the random oracle model. The attribute-based encryption schemes can be seen as extensions of ElGamal cryptosystem, with adaptive security relying on the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption, in the standard model. The proposed schemes are secure only in a bounded model: the systems admit L secret keys, at most, for a bound L that must be fixed in the setup of the systems.

In this paper, we propose a security-aware scheduling algorithm for a heterogeneous packet switched network. It provides real-time packet flows with guaranteed quality of service (QoS) while adaptively controls the packet's confidentiality security service level. The proposed scheme is modeled using the object-oriented multi-agent methodology. By applying a buffer estimation technique at the network's end nodes, the algorithm provides a real-time network congestion control hence satisfying the network performance metrics. In order to minimize the overhead of network association performed by the IPsec, the algorithm overloads the priority code point fields of the IEEE 802.1Q tagged frame format.

From many perspectives, solutions need to be flexible with regards to the entire originating process and operation process.

Certain requirements to secure the product continuously add further complexity to the aforementioned dimensions. Adversaries adapt - so the protection shall as well. However, adapting, particularly, technical solutions to products, implies the need for agnostic approaches. In this article, we propose a security-risk mitigation concept which aims to fit into the evolving automotive originating process applied to a particular class of electronic control units. Technically, the proposed approach shuffles the system memory-map of an asynchronous multiprocessing system. On the intermediate layer between the hardware and software, the assignment of memory and resources is obfuscated to a potential adversary who managed to breach one of the higher level memory protection mechanisms. As a result, the proposed mitigation adds either a further level in a defense-in-depth security architecture or fixes a structural vulnerability of certain hardware architectures.","Security; Mixed-Criticality; Obfuscation; Automotive","9th International Conference on Adaptive and Self-Adaptive Systems and Applications (ADAPTIVE), Athens, GREECE, FEB 19-23, 2017","Schnarz, P (Corresponding Author), Tech Univ Clausthal, Software Syst Engn, Clausthal Zellerfeld, Germany.

In the case of threshold public-key encryption, at least t <= n servers need to contribute to the decryption process. A threshold primitive is said robust if no coalition of t malicious servers can prevent remaining honest servers from successfully completing private key operations. So far, most practical non-interactive threshold cryptosystems, where no interactive conversation is required among decryption servers, were only proved secure against static corruptions. In the adaptive corruption scenario (where the adversary can corrupt servers at any time, based on its complete view), all existing robust threshold encryption schemes that also resist chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA) till recently require interaction in the decryption phase. A specific method (in composite order groups) for getting rid of interaction was recently suggested, leaving the question of more generic frameworks and constructions with better security and better flexibility (i.e., compatibility with distributed key generation). This paper describes a general construction of adaptively secure robust non-interactive threshold cryptosystems with chosen-ciphertext security. We define the notion of all-but-one perfectly sound threshold hash proof systems that can be seen as (threshold) hash proof systems with publicly verifiable and simulation-sound proofs. We show that this notion generically implies threshold cryptosystems combining the aforementioned properties. Then, we provide efficient instantiations under well-studied assumptions in bilinear groups (e.g., in such groups of prime order). These instantiations have a tighter security proof and are indeed compatible with distributed key generation protocols.","Threshold cryptography; adaptive corruptions; public-key encryption; chosen-ciphertext security; non-interactivity; robustness","9th Theory of Cryptography Conference (TCC), Taormina, ITALY, MAR 19-21, 2012","Libert, B (Corresponding Author), Catholic Univ Louvain, ICTEAM Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.

Therefore, it is necessary to perform trade-off analysis among non-functional requirements to establish balance among them. In this paper, we target the timing requirements of real-time embedded systems, and introduce an approach for choosing appropriate encryption algorithms at runtime, to achieve satisfaction of timing requirements in an adaptive way, by monitoring and keeping a log of their behaviors. The approach enables the system to adopt a less or more time consuming (but presumably stronger) encryption algorithm, based on the feedback on previous executions of encryption processes.

We extend MITIGATE, a maritime-specific risk assessment methodology, to capture situations in the risk assessment process and thus produce fine-grained and situation-specific, dynamic risk estimations. Then, we integrate DynSMAUG, a situation-driven security management system, to enforce adaptive security policies that dynamically implement security controls specific to each situation. To validate the proposed framework, we test it based on maritime cargo transfer service. We utilize various maritime specific and generic systems employed during cargo transfer, to produce dynamic risks for various situations. Our results show that the proposed framework can effectively assess dynamic risks per situation and automate the enforcement of adaptive security controls per situation. This is an important improvement in contrast to static and situation-agnostic risk assessment frameworks, where security controls always default to worst-case risks, with a consequent impact on the cost and the applicability of proper security controls.","adaptive security; event management and analytics; situation-based risk assessment; situational policy elicitation and enforcement","","Grigoriadis, C; Kotzanikolaou, P (Corresponding Author), Univ Piraeus, Dept Informat, SecLab, Karaoli & Dimitriou 80, Piraeus 18534, Greece.

In battlefields, the framework adapts to the contingent damages on the network infrastructure. Depending on the availability of the network infrastructure, our design is composed of two modes. In infrastructure mode, security services, specifically the authentication services, are implemented on UAVs that feature low overhead and flexible managements. When the UAVs fail or are destroyed, our system seamlessly switches to infrastructureless mode, a backup mechanism that maintains comparable security services among the surviving units. In the infrastructureless mode, the security services are localized to each node's vicinity to comply with the ad hoc communication mechanism in the scenario.

The key solution to achieve this goal is to integrate multiple avionic systems, apply new signal processing and RF capabilities. A generalized and reconfigurable architecture of Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) with integrated and modularised structure based on Direct RF Sampling (DRFS) and Software Defined Radio (SDR) is presented in this paper for avionic applications. The proposed architecture is composed of a DRFS digital receiver integrated within a SDR software modules. DRFS technology is adopted in the digital receiver, which consists of Pre-selection Filters and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to provide flexible compatibility for diverse modulation modes and various RF/IF frequency bands. By employing the concept of DRFS/SDR, distinct procedures for different avionic purposes, such as Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range (VOR) and Instrument Landing System (ILS), can be achieved in the same hardware platform. Notably, this proposed architecture has the potential to be reconfigured and improved in several ways without any hardware change to accommodate new features and signal capabilities. As per experimental validation phase, an MMR integrated system for VOR and ILS receivers has been designed and implemented. Test results have illustrated that the implementation feasibility of multi-mode DRFS avionic receivers is beneficial and efficient using the proposed architecture.

First, transport routes are divided into smaller route segments. Second, likelihood scores of security-related accidents in which dangerous freight is involved and possibly causing fatalities in the surrounding population, are determined per route segment. Third, the consequences of accident scenarios (using reference products and spatial plans) are calculated in terms of the number of people within the 1% lethality distance of the accident center. Fourth, using these likelihood scores and consequence figures, transport route security risk levels are determined. Fifth, transshipment risks are considered for determining the final transport route security risk levels. This leads to a multi-modal user-friendly security threat assessment tool which can be used by policy makers as well as by industrialists (shippers or Logistics Service Providers). The generic method allows for comparing the security risk levels of the different route segments and routes of transportation of hazardous goods and for taking countermeasures from a uni-modal as well as from a multi-modal perspective.

To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first anonymous spatial encryption that provides the anonymity property in adaptive security model, whose construction is based on a dual system encryption mechanism in bilinear composite-order groups. We also give a conversion construction to move into a prime-order setting with canceling property, whose security is based on the Decision Linear Problem.

Threat modeling allows for a by-design approach, mitigating problems before they arise and avoiding later costly development efforts. However, it mainly pays off in software construction approaches that rely on planned architectures, in which sources of threats can be anticipated beforehand. These axiomatic assumptions are, however, increasingly untrue in contemporary software development practices in which software systems evolve drastically in later stages. In addition, software-intensive systems are increasingly faced with uncertainty in their operational contexts, and these are nearly impossible to enumerate in early development stages. In this article, we first present the idea of reflective threat modeling, which involves the automated derivation of architectural system models from run-time and operational system artifacts, providing the threat modeler with an accurate and workable run-time inspection view of the system. We then outline and motivate the potential of adopting threat analysis models as a basis for holistic and adaptive threat management through integration of adaptive security and privacy technologies. This will enable systems to autonomously respond to emerging threats by dynamically activating dedicated controls or via run-time reconfiguration.","Threat modeling; threat analysis; threat management; security; privacy; run-time reflection; architecture-centric adaptation","International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS), ELECTR NETWORK, MAY 22-30, 2021","Van Landuyt, D (Corresponding Author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Imec DistriNet, Dept Comp Sci, Heverlee, Belgium. van Landuyt, Dimitri; Sion, Laurens; Joosen, Wouter, Katholieke Univ Leuven, Imec DistriNet, Dept Comp Sci, Heverlee, Belgium.

Many approaches have been implemented in literature to secure the single user data using biometric security systems. Most of these systems are based on static initialization parameters and fixed multi-modal biometric features for data authentication. Also, traditional multi-modal biometric based data authentication schemes are independent of dynamic variation in integrity verification. In order to overcome these problems, a new multi-user based multi-modal authentication framework is designed and implemented on large image data types. In this framework, different biometric features such as IRIS, facial and fingerprint features are used to find the unique integrity of user for data authentication and security process. A new integrity computational algorithm and encryption technique are implemented to provide the strong data integrity verification and data security in distributed applications. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-modal integrity-based encryption model has nearly 7% of computational integrity bit change and 5% of runtime on large dataset.","Fingerprint recognition; Authentication; Encryption; Sensors; Biological system modeling; Feature extraction; Biometric sensing distributed computing; encryption; integrity; multi-modal biometrics; sensor","","Rahman, ZU (Corresponding Author), KL Univ, Koneru Lakshmanih Educ Fdn, Dept ECE, Guntur 522052, Andhra Pradesh, India.

With the support of the offline optimal secure protocol selection module and the online self-adaptive security control module, the framework is capable of deploying different combinations of secure protocols to satisfy different security needs at different conditions for different applications.

In parallel, the research communities are collaborating to lower the entry barriers for space activities to deliver more innovative and cost-effective space missions. This evolution has been termed as New Space. However, this transformation of the space ecosystem has led to changes in the threat landscape, introducing new threat vectors and threat actors intent on compromising space systems and missions. As a result, it is expected that cyber threats could increase against space systems. Furthermore, teleoperation, a significant use case for building extraterrestrial habitats, has already been shown vulnerable in other domains as well. For example, teleoperated robots developed for remote surgery have been shown to be vulnerable to threats, such as malicious control due to an elevation-of-privilege attack. Threat modelling is a systematic and structured method to determine associated system vulnerabilities, possible attack entry points and vectors, and potential impacts on the system. In this work, we examine the efficacy of the de facto threat modelling methods such as STRIDE/DREAD in capturing highly adaptive security requirements and threats from a system-centric perspective for the teleoperation mission scenario. Understanding and protecting these hardware-software assets and their interaction in the mission is of foremost importance since security breaches threaten human safety across the broader New Space ecosystem. This research presents the limitations of existing threat modelling approaches in capturing hardware-software interaction in space systems, which is an open area for scientific enquiry. Moreover, research challenges are raised to improve the safety and security of the teleoperation mission.

In Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), secure allocation of tasks remains challenging due to the limited storage, battery life and computational power of mobile devices connected to the core cloud cluster infrastructure. Secure wireless communication channels and protocols for protecting the data and information sent to the cloud, and remote access to secure cloud services, are other important problems related to task scheduling and processing in dynamic MCC. In this paper, we developed a new security-aware task allocation model strategy in Mobile Cloud Computing. In this model, we define an allocation algorithm which generates an optimal and secure configuration of communication protocols in order to meet the specific data confidentiality requirements defined by end users. Resource utilization is predicted using Machine Learning methods, and the optimal secure service for task execution is selected. We developed a simulation environment (MocSecSim) for the evaluation of the algorithms proposed in several scenarios based on the users' requirements. The results of simulations and experiments have demonstrated that the model proposed significantly improves the level of security of calculations in comparison with a configuration where processing time and energy consumption are the main criteria for optimizing task allocation.","Security; Mobile Cloud Computing; Machine learning; Simulation","","Nawrocki, P (Corresponding Author), AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Comp Sci, Al A Mickiewicza 30, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland.

The well-known constructions of identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) with constant size ciphertexts in the standard model are based on the non-standard cryptography assumption. In addition, these constructions cannot solve the trade-off between the private keys and ciphertexts. These folklore construction methods lead to schemes that are somewhat inefficient and leave open the problem of finding more efficient direct constructions. In this paper, we give a secure identity-based broadcast encryption scheme with a constant-size ciphertext and private keys. It is constructed by using dual techniques in the subgroups. The proposed scheme achieves the full security (adaptive security) under three static (i.e. non q-based) assumptions. It is worth noting that only recently Waters's scheme achieves adaptive security under simple assumptions. One feature of our scheme is that it is relatively simple to get adaptive security.

This paper proposes a conventional iris authentication system and a hardware-friendly QC-LDPC error correction code scheme on a microprocessor-FPGA platform. Different QC-LDPC codes in IEEE 802.16e were analyzed and selected. Suitable codes were applied, followed by the evaluation experiments.

Yet, we argue that it is intrinsically desirable to provide anonymity in standard applications of BE and that it can be achieved at a moderate cost. We provide a security definition for Anonymous Broadcast Encryption (ANOBE) and show that it is achievable assuming only the existence of IND-CCA secure public key encryption (PKE). Focusing on reducing the size of ciphertexts, we then give two generic constructions for ANOBE. The first is from any anonymous (key-private) IND-CCA secure PKE scheme, and the second is from any IBE scheme that satisfies a weak security notion in the multi-TA setting. Furthermore, we show how randomness re-use techniques can be deployed in the ANOBE context to reduce computational and communication costs, and how a new cryptographic primitive - anonymous hint systems - can be used to speed up the decryption process in our ANOBE constructions. All of our results are in the standard model, achieving fully collusion-resistant ANOBE schemes secure against adaptive IND-CCA adversaries.","Broadcast Encryption; Anonymity","15th International Conference on Practice and Theory in Public Key Cryptography (PKC), Darmstadt, GERMANY, MAY 21-23, 2012","Libert, B (Corresponding Author), Catholic Univ Louvain, ICTEAM Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.

With the advantages of low cost and fast access speed, non-volatile memories (NVMs) like NAND flash memory have become a critical component in building security-critical real-time embedded devices. Therefore, to improve the security protection of NVM-based embedded systems becomes a great challenge. In this paper, we are interested in online optimization of security-sensitive storage applications over modern NVM-based embedded systems, whose workloads are unpredictable but have explicit timing constraint and certain security constraint. Sensitive data must be stored before a specific deadline, otherwise it will lose its validity. To address these challenges, this paper presents a Feedback Vulnerability and Utilization Control (FVUC) mechanism. FVUC employs two proportional-integral controllers, the Utilization Controller and the Vulnerability Controller, to build a big feedback loop which dynamically monitors the system run-time status as well as decides how many flash pages would be encrypted by a cryptography service. Relied on the accurate model and design, FVUC can make a balance between the utilization and vulnerability, and achieve a better overall performance. Based on synthetic experiments, we obtain that FVUC can fully beat other three mechanisms on the overall performance with acceptable time overhead. Equipped with proportional-integral controller, FVUC can make the system more stable than the one with only proportional controller. The proposed mechanism can be utilized to resist on-line confidential attack and even achieve the off-line privacy protection when embedded devices are lost or stolen. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The existing solutions treat security as an aggregated quality by enforcing ``one service for all'' without considering the explicit security requirements of each asset or the costs associated with security. Dealing with the security of assets in ultra-large environments calls for rethinking the way we select and compose services-considering not only the services but the underlying supporting computational resources in the process. We motivate the need for an asset-centric, self-adaptive security framework that selects and allocates services and underlying resources in the cloud. The solution leverages learning algorithms and market-inspired approaches to dynamically manage changes in the runtime security goals/requirements of assets with the provision of suitable services and resources, while catering for monetary and computational constraints. The proposed framework aims to inform the self-adaptive security efforts of security researchers and practitioners operating in dynamic large-scale environments, such as the Cloud. To illustrate the utility of the proposed framework it is evaluated using simulation on an application based scenario, involving cloud-based storage and security services.","assets; cloud computing; market-based; security; self-adaptation","","Mera-Gomez, C (Corresponding Author), ESPOL Polytech Univ, Fac Ingn Elect & Comp, Escuela Super Politecn Litoral, ESPOL, Campus Gustavo Galindo Km 30-5 Via Perimetral, Guayaquil, Ecuador.

The unsupervised broadcast strategy allows malicious users (even though someone outside the system with the intentionally divulged public parameters) to distribute junk messages without responsibility. Consequently, content distributor authentication is essential for broadcast encryption systems to forbid spreading of junk information. In this work, we devise a solution for public key broadcast encryption system with adaptive security to resolve the aforementioned vicious broadcaster problem, which is neglected in the previous related works. In our scheme, any user could distribute an encryption of messages with both public parameters and his/her own secret keys, and each message is associated to its broadcaster. The construction is based on the composite order bilinear groups and its adaptive security depends on the hardness of the general subgroup decisional assumptions. Furthermore, this allows our scheme to be flexible in terms on the overhead of ciphertexts, which is constant sized. Compared with previous related broadcast encryption systems constructed in the composite order bilinear groups, our scheme inherits the superiority of adaptive security based non-interactive falsifiable assumption, and simultaneously achieves the optimal ciphertext overhead and the authentication of broadcasters.","Broadcast encryption; Adaptive security; Authenticated broadcaster; Composite order bilinear group","","Zhang, H (Corresponding Author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, State Key Lab Networking & Switching Technol, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.

In this paper, a hybrid template security technique is designed for a bi-modal biometric system based on fingerprint and hand geometry. The technique first use the bio-hashing, in order to transform the actual feature vectors (FVs) into respective binary feature vectors (BFVs) and then applying a transformation scheme to fuse the binary vectors into a secured template. In order to improve the storage overhead for the protected template, a novel octet indexing technique is applied on the intermediate feature vector (IFV). The proposed technique results in improvement of storage requirement by representing secured template as a 64-bits vector with octet indexing. Furthermore, the proposed technique results in the overall enhancement of the recognition accuracy as compared to fingerprint and hand geometry uni-biometrics.

Recent trends in algebraic cryptanalysis tend to use Modular Addition 2(n) over logic Exclusive-OR as a mixing operator to guard against security threats. We propose a newly designed framework for Modular Addition over field GF (2) satisfying the algebraic properties of regular Modular Addition 2(n) albeit with cumulative security enhancements and increased complexity to address these challenges. Nevertheless, it has been observed that the complexity of Modular Addition can be drastically decreased with the appropriate formulation of polynomial equations and probabilistic conditions. In this article we propose a new extended design framework for advanced Modular Addition and it is characterized by user-specified extendable security which does not impose additional changes in existing layout of ciphers including both stream and block ciphers. This framework can be rapidly scaled to use-specific requirements which boosts the algebraic degree of the overall structure. This, in turn it thwarts the probabilistic conditions by retaining the original complexity sans critical modifications of Modular Addition 2(n).","Algebraic Cryptanalysis; Addition Modulo; Algebraic Degree; Scalability; SNOW2.0; TRIVIUM; S-Box; IDEA; AES; LFSR; NFSR; SAT solver; Stream Cipher; Block Cipher","11th International Conference on Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST), Barcelona, SPAIN, DEC 05-07, 2016","Siddavaatam, P (Corresponding Author), Ryerson Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, OPR AL Labs, Toronto, ON M5B 2K3, Canada.

Although a variety of parallel disk systems were developed, most existing disk systems lack a means to adaptively control the quality of security for dynamically changing workloads. We address this gap in disk technology by designing, implementing, and evaluating a quality of security control framework for parallel disk systems, or ASPAD for short, that makes it possible for parallel disk systems to adapt to changing security requirements and workload conditions. The ASPAD framework comprises four major components, namely, a security service middleware, a dynamic data-partitioning mechanism, a response time estimator, and an adaptive security quality controller. The framework is conducive to adaptively and expeditiously determining security services for requests submitted to a parallel disk system in a way to improve security of the disk system while making an effort to guarantee desired response times of the requests. We conduct extensive experiments to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed ASPAD framework. Empirical results show that ASPAD significantly improves the overall performance of parallel disk systems over the same disk systems without using the ASPAD framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

What we show in this paper is that we can, instead, improve the cryptography to offset the lack of possible randomness. We provide public-key encryption schemes that achieve IND-CPA security when the randomness they use is of high quality, but, when the latter is not the case, rather than breaking completely, they achieve a weaker but still useful notion of security that we call IND-CDA. This hedged public-key encryption provides the best possible security guarantees in the face of bad randomness. We provide simple RO-based ways to make in-practice IND-CPA schemes hedge secure with minimal software changes. We also provide non-RO model schemes relying on lossy trapdoor functions (LTDFs) and techniques from deterministic encryption.

Although a number of parallel disk systems have been developed, the systems lack a means to optimize quality of security for dynamically changing networked environments. We remedy this situation by proposing an adaptive quality of security control scheme for networked parallel disk systems (or ASPAD for short) that makes it possible for networked disk systems to adapt to changing security requirements and workload conditions. ASPAD is carried out in three phases: dynamic data partitioning, response time estimation, and adaptive security quality control. Hence, ASPAD is conducive to adaptively and expeditiously determining security schemes for disk requests in a way to improve security of networked parallel disk systems while making an effort to guarantee desired response times of the requests To prove the efficiency of the proposed approach, we simulate a networked parallel disk system into which nine cryptographic schemes are integrated. Empirical results show that ASPAD significantly improves overall performance over an existing strategy with an average of 65%.","","15th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks, Arlington, VA, OCT 09-11, 2006","Nijim, M (Corresponding Author), New Mexico Inst Min & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Socorro, NM 87801 USA.

In this paper, a cognitive security (CS) concept for wireless communication systems in the physical layer is proposed with the aim of providing a comprehensive solution to wireless security problems. The proposed method will enable the comprehensive security to ensure a robust and reliable communication in the existence of adversaries by providing adaptive security solutions in the communication systems by exploiting the physical layer security from different perspective. The adaptiveness relies on the fact that radio adapts its propagation characteristics to satisfy secure communication based on specific conditions which are given as user density, application specific adaptation, and location within CS concept. Thus, instead of providing any type of new security mechanism, it is proposed that radio can take the necessary precautions based on these conditions before the attacks occur. Various access scenarios are investigated to enable the CS while considering these conditions.","","","Yilmaz, MH (Corresponding Author), Natl Telecommun & Informat Adm, Inst Telecommun Sci, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.

[PKC 2015] for constructing almost-tight identity based encryptions (IBE) in the multi-instance, multi-ciphertext (MIMC) setting. However only a composite-order instantiation was proposed and more efficient prime-order instantiations are absent. The paper fills the blank by presenting two constructions. We revise the definition of ENDSG and realize it using prime-order bilinear groups based on Chen and Wee's prime-order instantiation of nested dual system groups [CRYPTO 2013]. This yields the first almost-tight IBE in the prime-order setting achieving weak adaptive security in MIMC scenario under the d-linear (d-Lin) assumption. We further enhanced the revised ENDSG to capture stronger security notions for IBE, including B-weak adaptive security and full adaptive security. We show that our prime-order instantiation is readily B-weak adaptive secure and full adaptive secure without introducing extra assumption. We then try to find better solutions by fine-tuning ENDSG again and realizing it using the technique of Chen, Gay, and Wee [EUROCRYPT 2015]. This leads to an almost-tight secure IBE in the same setting with better performance than our first result, but the security relies on a non-standard assumption, d-linear assumption with auxiliary input (d-LinAI) for an even positive integer d. However we note that, the 2-LinAI assumption is implied by the external decisional linear (XDLIN) assumption. This concrete instantiation could also be realized using symmetric bilinear groups under standard decisional linear assumption.","Identity based encryptions; Dual system groups; Tight security; Security model; Prime-order bilinear groups","19th IACR International Conference on the Theory and Practice of Public-Key Cryptography (PKC), Taipei, TAIWAN, MAR 06-09, 2016","Chen, J (Corresponding Author), East China Normal Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Multidimens Informat Proc, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

Solutions for enabling information security in BANs require extensive use of cryptographic primitives that involve considerable performance overhead. Consequently, information security is typically not available in wearable technologies. We need adaptive security solutions that increase the level of security in the event of threats but otherwise impose minimal security overhead in order for them to viable for BANs. The first step in building adaptive security for BANs is to detect the threats. In this paper we propose a solution for detecting adversaries attacking the communication channel of a BAN called a wearable honeypot system. It works by communicating fake user health information between the base station and a set of designated decoy nodes in the BAN. Any alteration of this traffic, in content or arrival time, is considered adversarial tampering. A preliminary implementation of this wearable honeypot system demonstrates that it is effective in detecting a variety of communication attacks on a BAN.","","37th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium (Sarnoff), New Jersey Inst Technol, Newark, NJ, SEP 19-21, 2016","Leonard, AM (Corresponding Author), Worcester Polytech Inst, Dept Comp Sci, Worcester, MA 01609 USA.

By leveraging intrinsic hardware characteristics, we aim to design a computationally lightweight security software system architecture so that complex cryptography computation can dramatically be prohibited. We exploit the innovative idea of Public Physical Unclonable Functions (PPUFs) that fundamentally protects attackers from recovering the secret key from public gate delay information. We implement its hardware logic in a real-world FPGA board. On top of the PPUF fingerprint hardware, we present an adaptive security control mechanism consisting of adaptive key generation and key exchange protocol, which adjusts security strength depending on system load dynamics. We demonstrate that our PPUF FPGA implementation embeds distinctive variability enough to distinguish between two different PPUFs with high fidelity. We validate our PUFSec architecture by implementing necessary algorithms and protocols in a real-world IoT platform, and performing empirical evaluation in terms of computation and memory usages, proving its practical feasibility.","","IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM), Atlanta, GA, MAY 01-04, 2017","Lee, H (Corresponding Author), Ewha Womans Univ, Seoul, South Korea.

IBRS can be classified into unbounded IBRS and bounded IBRS, depending on whether to set a maximal revocation number (e.g., N) or not. Compared to unbounded IBRS, existing bounded IBRS schemes have the advantage of short ciphertexts, however, they cannot support an increase of N and have to fix a large N to provide the revocation. This compromises the computational efficiency, which is linear in N. To bridge this gap, we are interested in exploring whether N can be dynamic. Precisely, N is initially set as a small number and increased into a larger one when more than N identities are revoked, while this increase does not affect other non-revoked users in the system. In this paper, motivated by the security of bounded IBRS with a dynamic N, we define an enhanced security model, which allows the corruption of any polynomial number (e.g., n) of private keys, independent of N. It augments existing security models by running different challenges when n N, respectively. The enhanced security model suits both unbounded 1BRS and bounded IBRS with a general description that can be ``empty'' for unbounded IBRS or a special N for bounded IBRS. Then, we propose a scalable bounded IBRS scheme and are able to prove its security in an enhanced security model. The increase of N incurs no changing on all of the existing private keys and the only cost is a slight expansion of the master public keys. Our proposed scheme also has short ciphertexts and private keys, comparable to the state-of-the-art (bounded) IBRS schemes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Business services outsourcing and their dynamic collaboration context can bring lost of control on IS and new security risks can occur. This leads to inconsistent protection allowing competitors to access to unauthorized information. To address this issue, systematic security service invocations may be added, without paying attention to the business context leading to costly over protection. To address this issue, an adaptive security service model deployment is required to provide a business service consistent protection by taking into account the collaboration context (business service data criticity, partners involved in the collaboration, etc.), and the cloud deployment and execution environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security model based on MDS@run.time, the marriage of Model Driven Security (MDS) and Models@run.time approaches, allowing to select at runtime the appropriate security components to apply. The MDS approach is used to generate security policies, which are interpreted at runtime and load appropriate security mechanisms depending on the context (which takes advantage of the Models@run.time approach) ensuring business process end to end protection. A proof of concept prototype is built on top of the OW2 FraSCAti middleware, validating our proposition efficiency. Our experiments and simulations show that MDS@run.time improves the system efficiency when the over-protection risk rate increases.","","9th IEEE International Symposium on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE), San Francisco Bay, CA, MAR 30-APR 03, 2015","Ouedraogo, WF (Corresponding Author), Univ Lyon, CNRS INSA Lyon, LIRIS UMR 5205, 20 Ave Albert Einstein, F-69621 Villeurbanne, France.

This survey provides a systematic overview of security and privacy issues based on prospective technologies for 6G in the physical, connection, and service layers, as well as through lessons learned from the failures of existing security architectures and state-of-the-art defenses. Two key lessons learned are as follows. First, other than inheriting vulnerabilities from the previous generations, 6G has new threat vectors from new radio technologies, such as the exposed location of radio stripes in ultra-massive MIMO systems at Terahertz bands and attacks against pervasive intelligence. Second, physical layer protection, deep network slicing, quantum-safe communications, artificial intelligence (AI) security, platform-agnostic security, real-time adaptive security, and novel data protection mechanisms such as distributed ledgers and differential privacy are the top promising techniques to mitigate the attack magnitude and personal data breaches substantially.","Security; 6G mobile communication; Privacy; 5G mobile communication; Computer architecture; Systematics; Standards; 6G; security and privacy; AI security; physical layer security; connection security; service security","","Hwang, RH (Corresponding Author), Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Minhsiung 621301, Chiayi, Taiwan.

Moreover, security risk is evaluated subjectively based on Prospect Theory to reflect realistic scenarios where the attacker and the edge system do not similarly perceive the status of the infrastructure.

On the other side, memory-based system access authentication is becoming outdated and less preferred for live applications, especially where data security and customer privacy are crucial. Multi-modal authentication has outperformed the unimodal process with high accuracy and improved security in the user authentication field. Multi-modal biometric verification includes user attributes such as keystrokes, iris, speech, face, etc. For real-time execution of multi-modal biometric fusion-based live tracking for compatible applications. The study proposes an efficient continuous biometric user authentication system for a new challenge of pandemic time, a live online authentication of the evaluation process (CBUA-OE). The proposed CBUA-OE system can address the challenges associated with live proctoring and is also compatible with real-time implementation, deployment of authentication systems. The modified wolf optimization algorithm and CUBA-OE's optimal feature fusion algorithm give an edge over the other contemporary methods and make it more robust. In modern forms of authentication, the classification stage affects the overall outcome of the system, and the model's performance is also a factor of varying quality of datasets. In contrast, a hybrid LCNN-Salp swarm optimization-based classifier is more efficient and consistent in continuous user authentication. Here the performance of the proposed hybrid LCNN-Salp swarm optimization classifier is analyzed with different standard datasets. The results are compared with the existing state-of-art classifiers regarding the accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure.

In distributed real-time embedded applications, e.g., electric grid management and command and control applications, it is required to not only meet real-time constraints but also support the data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. Unfortunately, in general, cryptographic functions are computationally expensive, possibly causing deadline misses in real-time embedded systems with limited resources. As a basis for cost-effective security support in real-time embedded systems, we define a quantitative notion of Strength of Defense (SoD). Based on the SoD concept, we propose a novel adaptive security policy in which the SoD can be degraded by decreasing the cryptographic key length for certain tasks, if necessary, to improve the success ratio under overload conditions. Our approach is lightweight. The time complexity of our approach is linear and its amortized version has the constant overhead per Sol) adaptation period. Moreover, our approach supports desirable security features requiring an attacker to do extra work to find the cryptographic key.

In this context, there is a great demand for autonomous systems able to detect abnormal events such as violent acts aboard passenger cars and intrusions when the train is parked at the depot. To this end, we present an innovative approach which aims at providing efficient automatic event detection by fusing video and audio analytics and reducing the false alarm rate compared to classical stand-alone video detection. The multi-modal system is composed of two microphones and one camera and integrates onboard video and audio analytics and fusion capabilities. On the one hand, for detecting intrusion, the system relies on the fusion of ``unusual'' audio events detection with intrusion detections from video processing. The audio analysis consists in modeling the normal ambience and detecting deviation from the trained models during testing. This unsupervised approach is based on clustering of automatically extracted segments of acoustic features and statistical Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) modeling of each cluster. The intrusion detection is based on the three-dimensional (3D) detection and tracking of individuals in the videos. On the other hand, for violent events detection, the system fuses unsupervised and supervised audio algorithms with video event detection. The supervised audio technique detects specific events such as shouts. A GMM is used to catch the formant structure of a shout signal. Video analytics use an original approach for detecting aggressive motion by focusing on erratic motion patterns specific to violent events. As data with violent events is not easily available, a normality model with structured motions from non-violent videos is learned for one-class classification. A fusion algorithm based on Dempster-Shafer's theory analyses the asynchronous detection outputs and computes the degree of belief of each probable event.","Public transport security; violent and vandalism acts; embedded system; audio and video events detection; unsupervised and supervised approaches; data fusion; real and synthetic scenes; evaluation","Conference on Optics and Photonics for Counterterrorism, Crime Fighting, and Defence XI; and Optical Materials and Biomaterials in Security and Defence Systems Technology XII, Toulouse, FRANCE, SEP 21-23, 2015","Zouaoui, R (Corresponding Author), THALES, Adv Studies Dept, THALES CEA VisionLab, 1 Ave Augustin Fresnel, F-91767 Palaiseau, France.

To achieve a higher identification performance, a low cost, low power RFID tag with efficient anti-collision technique which provides a large throughput and flexible security mechanism is required. Moreover, the package of tag becomes a bottleneck to further reduce the RFID cost. In RFID reader design, the carrier leakage problem is a significant challenge which limits the sensitivity of the RFID receiver. And in order to increase the integration of an RFID system, a multi-mode, high efficient CMOS PA with a sufficient output power is preferred to be integrated in the reader transceiver IC.

The article presents two self- adaptive security systems for small scale as well as for large-scale systems. The security system is designed to include encryption accelerators and hash code generation accelerators. The security system designed for small-scale systems saves space and power using hardware adaptation by loading or creating only the required accelerator during execution of the application. It uses light weight cryptographic algorithms. A second design for large-scale systems focuses on getting more throughput by allocating more resources to the required accelerator at runtime. Two designs are created for hardware adaptation based on the accelerator requirement at runtime.

In this paper, adaptive security architecture is implemented to protect satellite services for smart grid group applications. The focus is on key management and policy provisioning. Leveraging Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) as the standard for smart grid centralized key/policy management architecture, a single Domain of Interpretation (DOI) is deployed and evaluated critically in terms of the added protocol signaling overhead on the satellite system for a fixed-network scenario.

This technique results in two key contributions: First, our new scheme has ciphertext size overhead O(r), where r is the number of revoked users, and the size of public and private keys is only a constant number of group elements from an elliptic-curve group of prime order. In addition, the public key allows us to encrypt to an unbounded number of users. Our system is the first to achieve such parameters. We give two versions of our scheme: a simpler version which we prove to be selectively secure in the standard model under a new, but non-interactive assumption, and another version that employs the new dual system encryption technique of Waters to obtain adaptive security under the d-BDH and decisional Linear assumptions. Second, we show that our techniques can be used to realize Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) systems with non-monotonic access formulas, where our key storage is significantly more efficient than previous solutions.

With the implemented mechanisms (e.g. WEP) a secure connection is not guaranteed The established mechanisms are insecure. This may be solved by the IEEE 802.11i standard. All components (wireless cards, access points) must support this standard for adaptive security. For a successful integration of a network-wide security concept, all systems must be considered. They must be as secure as possible for such a realization. A VPN connection among wireless systems and the local network is one solution. A concept for general security - analogous to intrusion detection systems (IDS) - can be implemented under this condition.

Similar as EAP-AKA, we assume that the first registered 3GPP AAA server in home domain (i.e. HPLMN, Home Public Land Mobile Network) takes charge of the responsibility of authentication for 3GPP/WiMAX UE by using AVs obtained from HSS (Home Subscriber Server). Using of this scheme, it is unnecessary to retrieve new AVs from HSS, if there are still unused AVs for the previous PLMN when the multi-mode UE leaves and reenters the same PLMN within its available period of critical period interval (CPI). Theoretical analysis show that a long CPI results in fewer accesses to the HSS, and only through adjusting the CPI period dynamically in accordance with the system parameters, the signaling cost can be reduced further, so as to achieve the energy-efficient purpose.","Interworking authentication; Authentication vector; Authentication and key agreement (AKA); Critical period interval","","Wang, L (Corresponding Author), Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Elect Engn, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China.

In such an FE scheme, encryption takes as input N pairs of attribute \{(xi, zi)\} (i is an element of[N]) for some N is an element of N where the attributes \{xi\} (i is an element of[N]) are public while the attributes \{zi\} (i is an element of[N]) are private. The indices i is an element of [N] are referred to as the slots. A secret key corresponds to some weight function f, and decryption recovers the weighted sum Sigma(N)(i=1) f(x(i))z(i). This is an important functionality with a wide range of potential real life applications. In the proposed FE schemes attributes are viewed as vectors and weight functions are arithmetic branching programs (ABP). We present two schemes with varying parameters and levels of adaptive security. (a) We first present a one-slot scheme that achieves adaptive security in the simulation-based security model against a bounded number of ciphertext queries and an arbitrary polynomial number of secret key queries both before and after the ciphertext queries. This is the best possible level of security one can achieve in the adaptive simulationbased framework. From the relations between the simulation-based and indistinguishability-based security frameworks for FE, it follows that the proposed FE scheme also achieves indistinguishabilitybased adaptive security against an a-priori unbounded number of ciphertext queries and an arbitrary polynomial number of secret key queries both before and after the ciphertext queries. Moreover, the scheme enjoys compact ciphertexts that do not grow with the number of appearances of the attributes within the weight functions. (b) Next, bootstrapping from the one-slot scheme, we present an unbounded-slot scheme that achieves simulation-based adaptive security against a bounded number of ciphertext and pre-ciphertext secret key queries while supporting an a-priori unbounded number of post-ciphertext secret key queries. The scheme achieves public parameters and secret key sizes independent of the number of slots N and a secret key can decrypt a ciphertext for any a-priori unbounded N. Further, just like the one-slot scheme, this scheme also has the ciphertext size independent of the number of appearances of the attributes within the weight functions. However, all the parameters of the scheme, namely, the master public key, ciphertexts, and secret keys scale linearly with the bound on the number of pre-ciphertext Our schemes are built upon asymmetric bilinear groups of prime order and the security is derived under the standard (bilateral) k-Linear (k-Lin) assumption. Our work resolves an open problem posed by Abdalla, Gong, and Wee in CRYPTO 2020, where they presented an unbounded-slot FE scheme for attribute-weighted sum achieving only semi-adaptive simulation security. At a technical level, our work extends the recent adaptive security framework of Lin and Luo [EUROCRYPT 2020], devised to achieve compact ciphertexts in the context of indistinguishability-based payload-hiding security, into the setting of simulation-based adaptive attribute-hiding security.

Thus far, several generic constructions of prime-order ABE schemes have been proposed with these encodings. Chen, Gay, and Wee (CGW) (Eurocrypt' 15) and Chen and Gong (CG) (Asiacrypt' 17) proposed generic constructions with predicate encodings with a trade-off in efficiency. In particular, the former construction (CGW ABE) has the shorter secret keys, whereas the latter construction (CG ABE) has the shorter master public keys and ciphertexts. Moreover, CG ABE requires three pairing operations during decryption, while CGW ABE requires four. Agrawal and Chase (AC) (TCC' 16) proposed a generic construction with pair encodings that is an extension of CGW ABE and can handle more complex predicates. Specifically, if pair encoding schemes satisfy perfect security (resp. relaxed perfect security), then AC ABE satisfies full security (resp. semi-adaptive security) from the standard k-linear assumption. However, there is no extension of CG ABE with pair encodings. In this paper, we construct this extension. As with the trade-off between CGW ABE and CG ABE, our proposed ABE has shorter master public keys and ciphertexts and larger secret keys, requires less pairing operations during decryption than AC ABE. Furthermore, as with AC ABE, our proposed ABE satisfies full security (resp. semi-adaptive security) if pair encoding schemes satisfy perfect security (resp. relaxed perfect security) from the standard k-linear assumption. As an application, we propose a ciphertext-policy ABE scheme for non-monotone span programs with compact ciphertexts satisfying semi-adaptive security.","Attribute-based encryption; Pair encoding; Generic construction; Prime-order bilinear groups","","Takayasu, A (Corresponding Author), Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol NICT, Cybersecur Res Inst, Secur Fundamentals Lab, 4-2-1 Nukui Kitamachi, Koganei, Tokyo 1848795, Japan.

However, network providers are incapable of handling all types of attacks as each security device is designed for a certain purpose. If an attack breaks out, only one particular device becomes busy in terms of resource usage while others being idle. Moreover, it is hard to adjust a level of security service with respect to the importance of network flow. To address these issues, we propose a new security solution, QoSE, which provides adaptive security services based on Network Function Virtualization (NFV). QoSE provides a capability to manage resource usage that the network flow is not concentrated on a specific node. We design QoSE considering a distributed NFV environment to avoid a single point of failure and a bottleneck problem. Our proposed solution has also shown a quick recovery from fault situation. In addition, we provide a novel resource optimization algorithm to operate security services efficiently.

This is somewhat inefficient and impractical if the broadcast user number is predetermined. In this paper, we propose an adaptively secure identity-based broadcast encryption in the standard model that supports arbitrary number of users in broadcast set, which eliminates the size of public parameters with a constant number of group elements O(1) and obtain short ciphertexts, secret keys, and public parameters. We use the techniques of semi-functional ciphertexts and semi-functional keys in orthogonal subgroups to implement the boundless broadcast set and adaptive security by means of dual-system encryption mechanism in a composite-order group, and we prove the scheme to be fully secure without the random oracles in the static assumptions. The proposed scheme captures the properties of confidentiality, adaptive security, constant key, and short ciphertext. We also evaluate the computational costs and communication overheads and give the deployment in secure set-top box broadcast systems.

One of the challenges with self-adaptation paradigm is that the reasoning engine must leverage existing requirements and constraints and at the same time deal with different types of imperfections due to absence of knowledge or data. The problem arises when the existing runtime requirements models offer no explicit support for imperfections. By imperfections, we mean the values of some attributes of interest are not available at certain points. To address this problem, we propose uncertain reasoning based on imperfect requirements using non-monotonic logic.

The concept of not saving the private key is very appealing, but the implementation of such a system shouldn't be rushed because it might prove less secure then current PKI infrastructure. One biometric characteristic can be easily spoofed, so it was believed that multi-modal biometrics would offer more security, because spoofing two or more biometrics would be very hard. This notion, of increased security of multi-modal biometric systems, was disproved for authentication and matching, studies showing that not only multi-modal biometric systems are not more secure, but they introduce additional vulnerabilities. This paper is a study on the implications of spoofing biometric data for retrieving the derived key. We demonstrate that spoofed biometrics can yield the same key, which in turn will lead an attacker to obtain the private key. A practical implementation is proposed using fingerprint and iris as biometrics and the fuzzy extractor for biometric key extraction. Our experiments show what happens when the biometric data is spoofed for both uni-modal systems and multi-modal. In case of multi-modal system tests were performed when spoofing one biometric or both. We provide detailed analysis of every scenario in regard to successful tests and overall key entropy. Our paper defines a biometric PKI scenario and an in depth security analysis for it. The analysis can be viewed as a blueprint for implementations of future similar systems, because it highlights the main security vulnerabilities for bioPKI. The analysis is not constrained to the biometric part of the system, but covers CA security, sensor security, communication interception, RSA encryption vulnerabilities regarding key entropy, and much more.","multi-modal key derivation; biometric PKI; biometric entropy; Wireless Sensor Security; user-centric security","","Dinca, LM (Corresponding Author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

This method is further implemented by FPGA hardware, such that the performances of real-time and security of the control network are both guaranteed.

The index size of adaptively secure SSE schemes without a random oracle can be much larger. In this paper, we propose a new SSE scheme which satisfies adaptive security in the standard model and has an optimal index size. Furthermore the index of our scheme consists of Bloom filters and simple arrays, that is, arrays of integers. Since Bloom filters are also implemented by an array of integers, the structure of the index is simple. Thus, unlike other SSE schemes with an optimal index size, the size does not depend on a security parameter.","Searchable symmetric encryption; Keyword search; Bloom filter","22nd Nordic Conference on Secure IT Systems (NordSec), Tartu, ESTONIA, NOV 08-10, 2017","Yamamoto, H (Corresponding Author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.

The proposed system combines real-time scheduling with security service enhancement. The scheduling unit uses the differentiated-earliest-deadline-first (Diff-EDF) scheduler and the security enhancement scheme adopts a congestion control mechanism. The required QoS is guaranteed for different types (audio and video) of real-time data flows, while the packet security levels are adaptively enhanced according to the feedbacks from the congestion control module. Compared with the IPsec protocol, the proposed scheme reduces the number of pending packets at the destinations.

With the traditional connectivity management in Long Term Evolution / Evolved Packet System (LTE/EPS) networks, security services such as confidentiality and integrity protection are designed to be activated in a systematic manner leading to significant signaling and processing cost. Therefore, new strategies need to be devised for cost-effective security provision. In this paper, we motivate the integration of a context-aware security controller into LTE/EPS networks to minimize the overall security cost. This controller activates security mechanisms according to the contextual information such as the application type and the device capabilities. By means of detailed quantitative analysis, we evaluate the processing cost associated to each security service. We demonstrate that the gain that is achieved in terms of processing cost justify taking additional complexity to support adaptive security mechanisms.","adaptive security; context-aware; processing load; LTE/EPS","IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC), London, ENGLAND, SEP 08-11, 2013","Said, SB (Corresponding Author), Orange Labs, Cesson Sevigne, France.

Our reduction has polynomial loss to the underlying primitives. We develop a ``punctured programming'' approach to constructing and proving systems where outside of obfuscation we rely only on primitives realizable from pseudo random generators. Our work consists of two constructions. Our first FE construction is provably secure against any attacker that is limited to making all of its private key queries after it sees the challenge ciphertext. (This notion implies selective security.) Our construction makes use of an we introduce called puncturable deterministic encryption (PDE) which may be of independent interest. With this primitive in place we show a simple FE construction. We then provide a second construction that achieves adaptive security from indistinguishability obfuscation. Our central idea is to achieve an adaptively secure functional encryption by bootstrapping from a one-bounded FE scheme that is adaptively secure. By using bootstrapping we can use ``selective-ish'' techniques at the outer level obfuscation level and push down the challenge of dealing with adaptive security to the one-bounded FE scheme, where it has been already been solved. We combine our bootstrapping framework with a new ``key signaling'' technique to achieve our construction and proof. Altogether, we achieve the first construction and proof for adaptive security for functional encryption.","","35th Annual International Cryptology Conference (CRYPTO), Santa Barbara, CA, AUG 16-20, 2015","Waters, B (Corresponding Author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.

To overcome these shortcomings, a method for delegating a short lattice basis is discussed in this paper. It maintains the lattice dimension is constant.

In addition, the currently known most efficient adaptively secure RIBE and selectively secure RHIBE schemes rely on non-standard assumptions, which are referred to as the augmented DDH assumption and q-type assumptions, respectively. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective design methodology for RHIBE schemes. We provide a generic design framework for RHIBE based on an HIBE scheme with a few properties. Fortunately, several state-of-the-art pairing-based HIBE schemes have the properties. In addition, our construction preserves the sizes of master public keys, ciphertexts, and decryption keys, as well as the complexity assumptions of the underlying HIBE scheme. Thus, we obtain the first RHIBE schemes with adaptive security under the standard k-linear assumption. We prove adaptive security by developing a new proof technique for RHIBE.

It actively emits almost inaudible acoustic signals from the earpiece speaker to ``illuminate'' the user's face and extracts features from the echoes using a customized convolutional neural network, which are fused with sophisticated visual features extracted from state-of-the-art face recognition models, for secure face authentication. Because the echo features depend on 3D facial geometries and material, our multi-modal design is not easily spoofed by images or videos like image based face recognition systems. It does not require any special sensors thus eliminating the extra costs in solutions like FaceID.

The same actions are represented in the graph of the learning automaton, but the probabilities of actions in the graph model are permanently updated based on the received reinforcement signals. Due to the adaptive reconfiguration of the nodes, the system is able to counteract the cyberattacks, preserving resiliency. The experimental study results for the emulated wireless sensor network (WSN) are presented and discussed. The packets loss rate stays below 20% when the number of malicious nodes is 20% of the total number of nodes, while the common system loses more than 70% of packets.

The proposed architecture is reconfigurable in the sense that operates in three different modes: as Keyed-Hash Authentication Code (HMAC), as SHA-1 and MD5 hash functions, according to WTLS specifications. This multi-mode operation is achieved due to the reconfigurable applied design technique in the proposed architecture, which keeps the allocated area resources at a minimized level. The proposed architecture achieves high speed performance, due to the pipeline designed architecture. Especially, SHA-1 operation achieved throughput is equal to 1,7 Gbps, while MD5 operation mode bit rate is equal to 2,1 Gbps. The proposed architecture has been integrated by using VHDL and has been synthesized placed and routed in an FPGA device. Comparisons with related hash functions implementations have been done in terms of throughput, operating frequency, allocated area and Area-Delay product. The achieved performance of the SHA-1 operation mode is better at about 14-42 times compared with the other conventional works. In addition, MD5 performance is superior to the other works at about 6-18 times, in all of the cases. The proposed Integrity Unit is a very trustful and powerful solution for the WTLS layer.

In recent years, many encryption algorithms have been proposed to provide the security of IoT communication. In this study, flexible and high-throughput hardware structures of the PRESENT, SIMON, and LED lightweight block ciphers are presented for IoT applications. The proposed flexible structures can perform various configurations of these block ciphers to support variable key sizes. For example, the PRESENT, SIMON, and LED ciphers support key sizes (80, 128 bits), (96, 144, 128, 192, and 256 bits), and (64, 128 bits), respectively. Therefore, these architectures provide versatile implementations that enable adaptive security level using a variable key size.

This technique allows detection of malicious activity to occur at the endpoints the individual host. This research proposes AHNSR: Active Host-based Network Security Response, which utilizes HIDS with Software Defined Networking (SDN) in order to enhance system security, allowing dynamic active response and reconstruction from a global network topology perspective. Vital to the operational architecture, SDN introduces new programming capabilities that resolve the rigid configurations of traditional networks. This is essential in an era of rapidly evolving threats that require unique and adaptive security defenses in both virtualized and enterprise environments. SDN-software security controls aim at providing access to legitimate users, protecting systems from attacks, and providing mitigation or countermeasures when attacks do occur. AHNSR is a complete and automated dynamic security solution, starting with alert generation and ending with an appropriate SON enabled response on physical switch flow tables. Responses can include traffic redirection, host quarantining, filtering, and more. SON allows greater flexibility and command/control compared to legacy, manual administrator response or the iptables solution of traditional IDS. By pushing security event information to a global controller, immediate and intelligent changes can be made across the network. When an attack occurs, AHNSR increases responsiveness while decreasing information damage- a goal every incident response team should have. We compare different methods of pushing security event information from hosts and the resulting system performance at specified security level thresholds. A testable SON-controlled network is constructed with multiple hosts, OpenFlow enabled switches, and a Floodlight controller, all linked to a custom, novel interface for the Open-Source SECurity (OSSEC) HIDS framework, OSSEC is implemented in a server-agent architecture, allowing scale bility and OS independence. System effectiveness is evaluated against the following factors: alert density, file integrity check frequency, rootkit detection status, and log monitoring workload, At the expected operational load of 500 events per second (EPS), results reveal a mean system response time of.5564 seconds from log generation to flow table update via Floodlight's Access Control List module, Load testing further assesses performance of response methods at EPS levels 10- 10000.","software defined networking (SDN); OpenFlow; active response; host -based intrusion detection system (HIDS); security","12th International Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security (ICCWS), Wright State Univ, Dayton, OH, MAR 02-03, 2017","Goodgion, J (Corresponding Author), Air Force Inst Technol, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA.

TWINKLE utilizes a two-mode adaptive security model that allows an IoT device to be in regular mode for most of the time which incurs a low resource consumption rate and only when suspicious behavior is detected, switch to vigilant mode which potentially incurs a higher overhead. We show the efficacy of TWINKLE in two case studies that address two types of attacks: distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and sinkhole attacks. We examine two existing intrusion detection and prevention systems and transform both into new, improved systems using TWINKLE. Our evaluations show that TWINKLE is not only friendly to resource-constrained devices, but can also successfully detect and prevent the two types of attacks, with a significantly lower overhead and detection latency than the existing systems.","Internet of Things; Smart home; Security; Resource consumption","14th European-Alliance-for-Innovation (EAI) International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Networks (SecureComm), Singapore, SINGAPORE, AUG 08-10, 2018","Sisodia, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.

A typical ICS includes an extensive range of computerized devices, control systems, and networking appliances used to manage efficiently an industrial process across large geographical areas. ICS underpin sensitive and critical national infrastructures such as water treatment and energy production and transportation. The consequences of a successful attack against them can lead to shutting the infrastructure down which has major impacts such as production stoppages or safety implications for people, the environment, and assets. At the same time, running a process while the infrastructure is under attack or compromised also has safety implications, potentially catastrophic. This work-in-progress focuses on an adaptive approach, able to alter the defensive posture while providing assurances about operational capacity (or downgrading it) and safety. Our approach involves transforming policies from simply a means to enforce security requirements defined a priori, to adaptive objects that are capable to evolve in response to unfolding attacks. We use a case study of reconnaissance attacks and moving target defense as a means to realize such adaptive security policies.","","13th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS ), ELECTR NETWORK, MAY 04-06, 2022","Samanis, E (Corresponding Author), Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England.

This paper is concerned with two variants of the transformation that appear but have not been clearly delineated in existing literature. Both variants start with the prover making a commitment. The strong variant then hashes both the commitment and the statement to be proved, whereas the weak variant hashes only the commitment. This minor change yields dramatically different security guarantees: in situations where malicious provers can select their statements adaptively, the weak Fiat-Shamir transformation yields unsound/ unextractable proofs. Yet such settings naturally occur in systems when zero-knowledge proofs are used to enforce honest behavior. We illustrate this point by showing that the use of the weak Fiat-Shamir transformation in the Helios cryptographic voting system leads to several possible security breaches: for some standard types of elections, under plausible circumstances, malicious parties can cause the tallying procedure to run indefinitely and even tamper with the result of the election. On the positive side, we define a form of adaptive security for zero-knowledge proofs in the random oracle model ( essentially simulation-sound extractability), and show that a variant which we call strong Fiat-Shamir yields secure non-interactive proofs. This level of security was assumed in previous works on Helios and our results are then necessary for these analyses to be valid. Additionally, we show that strong proofs in Helios achieve non-malleable encryption and satisfy ballot privacy, improving on previous results that required CCA security.","","18th International Conference on Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security (ASIACRYPT), Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA, DEC 02-06, 2012","Bernhard, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Bristol, Bristol, Avon, England.

However, the cyber-security of IoT enabled cyber-physical systems is still one of the main challenges. The success of cyber-physical system is highly reliant on its capability to withstand cyberattacks. Biometric identification is the key factor responsible for the provision of secure cyber-physical system. The conventional unimodal biometric systems do not have the potential to provide the required level of security for cyber-physical system. The unimodal biometric systems are affected by a variety of issues like noisy sensor data, non-universality, susceptibility to forgery and lack of invariant representation. To overcome these issues and to provide higher-security enabled cyber-physical systems, the combination of different biometric modalities is required. To ensure a secure cyber-physical system, a novel multi-modal biometric system based on face and finger print is proposed in this work. Finger print matching is performed using alignment-based elastic algorithm. For the improved facial feature extraction, extended local binary patterns (ELBP) are used. For the effective dimensionality reduction of extracted ELBP feature space, local non-negative matrix factorization is used. Score level fusion is performed for the fusion. Experimental evaluation is done on FVC 2000 DB1, FVC 2000 DB2, ORL (AT&T) and YALE databases.

However, we do not have a rigorous understanding of why better proofs are not known. (For ABE, the analog of hierarchy depth is the maximum number of attributes used in a ciphertext.) In this work, we define a certain commonly found checkability property on ciphertexts and private keys. Roughly the property states that any two different private keys that are both ``supposed to'' decrypt a ciphertext will decrypt it to the same message.

However, using a single biometric has several problems. In order to alleviate these problems, multi-modal biometric systems are proposed by combining various biometric modalities to improve the robustness of person authentication. A typical application is to combine both audio and face for multi-modal person recognition, since either face or voice is among the most natural biometrics that people use to identify each other. In this paper, a novel approach called multi-feature subspace analysis (MFSA) is proposed for audio-video based biometric person recognition. In the MFSA framework, each face sequence or utterance is represented with a fix-length feature vector, and then subspace analysis method is performed on a collection of random subspaces to construct an ensemble of classifiers for robust recognition.

To prevent such attacks, presentation attack detection (PAD) techniques have been proposed in the last decade. For the particular case of fingerprints, most approaches are based on conventional optical or capacitive sensors, acquiring a single image, and which can thus detect only a limited number of PAIs. In this work, we present a new multi-modal PAD approach based on a recently developed capture device, which is able to acquire four different types of samples: i) finger photos, ii) finger vein samples, iii) multi-spectral short wave infrared images, and iv) laser speckle contrast image sequence samples. Different ad-hoc algorithms have been developed for each set of images. The experimental evaluation over 35 PAIs, part of them used only at the test stage, shows the efficiency of the proposed approach in a realistic scenario, with an APCER of 6.6% for a BPCER of 0.2%.","Fingerprint; Presentation Attack Detection; Multi-Modal; Biometrics; Security","14th International Conference on Signal Image Technology & Internet Based Systems (SITIS), Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, SPAIN, NOV 26-29, 2018","Gomez-Barrero, M (Corresponding Author), Hsch Darmstadt, Da Sec Biometr & Internet Secur Res Grp, Darmstadt, Germany.

In this paper, the design and development of a multi-gigabit, broadband WDM network architecture, specifically designed for use in the aerospace environment, is discussed. A key element in the system is the arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG) wavelength multiplexing component, which has been designed to allow operation over the full military temperature specification (-55 degreesC to +125 degreesC) without additional environmental conditioning.

In this paper, we make significant progress in this area in the context of password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) and oblivious transfer (OT) protocols. More precisely, we first revisit the notion of projective hash proofs and introduce a new feature that allows us to explain any message sent by the simulator in case of corruption, hence the notion of Explainable Projective Hashing. Next, we demonstrate that this new tool generically leads to efficient PAKE and OT protocols that are secure against semi-adaptive adversaries without erasures in the Universal Composability (UC) framework. We then show how to make these protocols secure even against adaptive adversaries, using non-committing encryption, in a much more efficient way than generic conversions from semi-adaptive to adaptive security. Finally, we provide concrete instantiations of explainable projective hash functions that lead to the most efficient PAKE and OT protocols known so far, with UC-security against adaptive adversaries, without assuming reliable erasures, in the single global CRS setting. As an important side contribution, we also propose a new commitment scheme based on DDH, which leads to the construction of the first one-round PAKE adaptively secure under plain DDH without pairing, assuming reliable erasures, and also improves previous constructions of OT and two-or three-round PAKE schemes.","Oblivious transfer; Password authenticated key exchange; Erasures; Universal composability; Adaptive adversaries","20th International-Association-of-Cryptologic-Research (IACR) International Conference on Practice and Theory of Public-Key Cryptography (PKC), Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS, MAR 28-31, 2017","Benhamouda, F (Corresponding Author), IBM Res, Yorktown Hts, NY USA.

Often a highly secure mechanism inevitably consumes a rather large amount of system resources, which in turn may unintentionally cause a Security Service Denial of Service (SSDoS) attack. This paper proposes a self-adaptive resource-aware (SARA) security provisioning approach for WAHSNs. For resource scarce WAHSNs, SARA strives to provide the optimal tradeoff between the sufficient security (which is reflected by the Security Index (SI)) and the acceptable network performance degradation (which is reflected by the Performance Index (PI)). With the support of the offline optimal secure protocol selection module and the online self-adaptive security control module, SARA is capable of employing different combinations of secure protocol sets to satisfy different security need at different condition for different applications. To determine the security index SI of a secure protocol set, a heuristic cross-layer security-service mapping mechanism is presented. Furthermore, we evaluate performance index PI of a secure protocol set via simulation followed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Consequently, the proposed self-adaptive security provisioning based on both SI and PI achieves the maximum overall network security services and network performance services, without causing the SSDoS attack. Furthermore, this self-adaptive mechanism is capable of switching from one secure protocol set to another while keeping similar level of security and performance, it thus provides additional security by security service hopping.","wireless ad hoc and sensor networks; security; self-adaptive; security index; performance index; analysis of various","Conference on Sensors, and Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C31) Technologies for Homeland Security and Homeland Defense IV, Orlando, FL, MAR 28-APR 01, 2005","Chigan, CX (Corresponding Author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.

In these schemes, a quorum of at least (d <= n) servers needs to act upon a message to produce the result (decrypted value or signature), while corrupting less than d servers maintains the scheme's security. For about two decades, extensive study was dedicated to this subject, which created a number of notable results. So far, most practical threshold signatures, where servers act non-interactively, were analyzed in the limited static corruption model (where the adversary chooses which servers will be corrupted at the system's initialization stage). Existing threshold encryption schemes that withstand the strongest combination of adaptive malicious corruptions (allowing the adversary to corrupt servers at any time based on its complete view), and chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA) all require interaction (in the non-idealized model) and attempts to remedy this problem resulted only in relaxed schemes. The same is true for threshold signatures secure under chosen-message attacks (CMA). To date (for about 10 years), it has been open whether there are non-interactive threshold schemes providing the highest security (namely, CCA-secure encryption and CMA-secure signature) with scalable shares (i.e., as short as the original key) and adaptive security. This paper answers this question affirmatively by presenting such efficient decryption and signature schemes within a unified algebraic framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Despite extensive advances in facial anti-spoofing based on single-model image, little work has been devoted to multi-modal anti-spoofing, which is however widely encountered in real-world scenarios. Following the recent progress, this paper mainly focuses on multi-modal face anti-spoofing and aims to solve the following two challenges: (1) how to effectively fuse multi-modal information; and (2) how to effectively learn distinguishable features despite single cross-entropy loss. We propose a novel Multi-modal Multi-layer Fusion Convolutional Neural Network (mmfCNN), which targets at finding a discriminative model for recognizing the subtle differences between live and spoof faces. The mmfCNN can fully use different information provided by diverse modalities, which is based on a weight-adaptation aggregation approach. Specifically, we utilize a multi-layer fusion model to further aggregate the features from different layers, which fuses the low-, mid- and high-level information from different modalities in a unified framework. Moreover, a novel Average Binary Center (ABC) loss is proposed to maximize the dissimilarity between the features of live and spoof faces, which helps to stabilize the training to generate a robust and discriminative model. Extensive experiments conducted on the CISIA-SURF and 3DMAD datasets verify the significance and generalization capability of the proposed method for the face anti-spoofing task.

To complete these missions in outdoor environment, the robot system must have appropriate functions, accuracy and reliability. However, the more functions it has, the more difficulties occur in operation of the functions. To cope up with this problem, an effective user interface should be developed. Furthermore, the user interface is needed to be wearable for portability and prompt action. This research starts at the question: how to teleoperate the complicated slave robot easily. The main challenge Is to make a simple and intuitive user interface with a wearable shape and size. This research provides multi-modalities such as visual, auditory and haptic sense. It enables an operator to control every functions of a field robot more intuitively. As a result, an EOD (explosive ordnance disposal) demonstration is conducted to verify the validity of the proposed wearable multi-modal user interface.","","IEEE International Workshop on Safety, Security and Rescue Robots, Kobe, JAPAN, JUN 06-09, 2005","Ryu, D (Corresponding Author), Korea Inst Sci & Technol, Intelligence Robot Res Ctr, Seoul, South Korea.

Our core construction provides security against an attacker that makes a single key query for a machine T before declaring a challenge string w* that is associated with the challenge ciphertext. We build our construction by leveraging a Garbled RAM construction of Gentry, Halevi, Raykova and Wichs [33]; however, to prove security we need to introduce a new notion of security called iterated simulation security. We then show how to transform our core construction into one that is secure forana-priori bounded number q = q(lambda) ofkey queries that canoccur either before or after the challenge ciphertext. We do this by first showing howone can use a special type of non-committing encryption to transform a system that is secure only if a singlekey is chosenbefore the challenge ciphertext is declared into one where the single key can be requested either before or after the challenge ciphertext. We give a simple construction of this noncommitting encryption from public key encryption in the Random Oracle Model. Next, one can apply standard combinatorial techniques to lift from single-key adaptive security to q-key adaptive security.","","27th Annual International Conference on Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security, ELECTR NETWORK, DEC 06-10, 2021","Goyal, R (Corresponding Author), MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.

The economic data is of great importance to the corporations and governments, and they must be protected against the outsiders. Unfortunately, in an economic administration system, a few users may be malicious, or they are at high risk to leak information to the outsiders. Therefore, the economic data must also be protected against these users. The traditional broadcast encryption can provide protected data sharing among honest users. However, it is not efficient when most of the users are honest, and only a small amount of users are malicious. The traditional method is not cost effective, and does not fit to the situation where the set of malicious users dynamically changes either. Meanwhile, in traditional broadcast encryption, the authorized users' identities need to be sent with the ciphertext. The valid users' anonymity is not provided. To solve these problems, in this work, we present a novel cryptographic primitive, i.e. ID-based Dynamic Exclusive Broadcast Encryption (IBDEBE), and based on a hybrid framework (the combination of the exponent-inversion framework and the commutative-blinding framework) we propose an IBDEBE scheme with constant-size private keys and ciphertexts. The IBDEBE scheme is proved to be semi-adaptively semantically secure in the random oracle model. By applying the IBDEBE scheme, a secure economic data sharing protocol is devised, which is efficient and flexible in dynamic honest user groups, and it provides good security properties, i.e. source authenticity, data integrity protection, data access control, resistance to collusion attack and anonymity. We evaluate the performance of our solution with experiments and the results show good computation efficiency.

Both of these options are undesirable. However, KP-ABE can provide less key overhead compared to the traditional encryption schemes. While there are a lot of KP-ABE schemes, none of them simultaneously supports multiuse of attributes, adaptive security, monotone span programs, and static security assumption. Hence, we propose a fully secure KP-ABE scheme for monotone span programs in prime-order group. This scheme uses selective security proof techniques to obtain the requisite ingredients for full security proof. This strengthens the correlation between selective and full security models and enables the transition of the best qualities in selective security models to fully secure systems.

However, there are many advantages of detection using multi-modal imagery for defence and security operations. For example, the IR modality offers persistent surveillance and is essential in poor lighting conditions and 24hr operation. It is, therefore, crucial to create an object detection system which can use IR imagery. Collecting and labelling large volumes of thermal imagery is incredibly expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, we propose to mobilise labelled RGB data to achieve detection in the IR modality. In this paper, we present a method for multi-modal object detection using unsupervised transfer learning and adaptation techniques. We train faster RCNN on RGB imagery and test with a thermal imager. The images contain object classes; people and land vehicles and represent real-life scenes which include clutter and occlusions. We improve the baseline F1-score by up to 20% through training with an additional loss function, which reduces the difference between RGB and IR feature maps. This work shows that unsupervised modality adaptation is possible, and we have the opportunity to maximise the use of labelled RGB imagery for detection in multiple modalities. The novelty of this work includes; the use of the IR imagery, modality adaption from RGB to IR for object detection and the ability to use real-life imagery in uncontrolled environments.

Much of the progresses have been made by the availability of face antispoofing benchmark datasets in recent years. However, existing face anti-spoofing benchmarks have limited number of subjects (<= 170) and modalities (<= 2), which hinder the further development of the academic community. To facilitate face anti-spoofing research, we introduce a large-scale multi-modal dataset, namely CASIA-SURF, which is the largest publicly available dataset for face anti-spoofing in terms of both subjects and visual modalities. Specifically, it consists of 1,000 subjects with 21, 000 videos and each sample has 3 modalities (i.e., RGB, Depth and IR). We also provide a measurement set, evaluation protocol and training/validation/testing subsets, developing a new benchmark for face anti-spoofing. Moreover, we present a new multi-modal fusion method as baseline, which performs feature re-weighting to select the more informative channel features while suppressing the less useful ones for each modal.

In these schemes, a quorum of at least (t <= n) servers needs to act upon a message to produce the result (decrypted value or signature), while corrupting less than t servers maintains the scheme's security. For about two decades, extensive study was dedicated to this subject, which created a number of notable results. So far, most practical threshold signatures, where servers act non-interactively, were analyzed in the limited static corruption model (where the adversary chooses which servers will be corrupted at the system's initialization stage). Existing threshold encryption schemes that withstand the strongest combination of adaptive malicious corruptions (allowing the adversary to corrupt servers at any time based on its complete view), and chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA) all require interaction (in the non-idealized model) and attempts to remedy this problem resulted only in relaxed schemes. The same is true for threshold signatures secure under chosen-message attacks (CMA). To date (for about 10 years), it has been open whether there are non-interactive threshold schemes providing the highest security (namely, CCA-secure encryption and CMA-secure signature) with scalable shares (i.e., as short as the original key) and adaptive security. This paper answers this question affirmatively by presenting such efficient decryption and signature schemes within a unified algebraic framework.","Threshold cryptography; encryption schemes; digital signatures; adaptive corruptions; non-interactivity","38th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP) / Annual Meeting of the European-Association-for-Theoretical-Computer-Science (EATCS), ETH Zurich, Zurich, SWITZERLAND, JUL 04-08, 2011","Libert, B (Corresponding Author), Catholic Univ Louvain, ICTEAM Inst, Louvain, Belgium.

Typically, automated, intuitive and real-time systems are required to recognize human activities and identify accurately unusual behaviors in order to prevent dangerous situations. In this work, we explore the combination of three modalities (RGB, depth and skeleton data) to design a robust multi-modal framework for vision-based human activity recognition. Especially, spatial information, body shape/posture and temporal evolution of actions are highlighted using illustrative representations obtained from a combination of dynamic RGB images, dynamic depth images and skeleton data representations. Therefore, each video is represented with three images that summarize the ongoing action. Our framework takes advantage of transfer learning from pre-trained models to extract significant features from these newly created images. Next, we fuse extracted features using Canonical Correlation Analysis and train a Long Short-Term Memory network to classify actions from visual descriptive images. Experimental results demonstrated the reliability of our feature-fusion framework that allows us to capture highly significant features and enables us to achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the public UTD-MHAD and NTU RGB+D datasets.","","25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), ELECTR NETWORK, JAN 10-15, 2021","Romaissa, BD (Corresponding Author), Univ Laarbi Ben Mhidi, Res Lab Comp Sci Complex Syst, Oum El Bouaghi, Algeria.

In this work, we propose a detailed training setup in the federated learning framework for object classification where the raw data will be maintained locally at the edge devices and will not be shared with a central server or with each other. The server sends a global model to edge devices, which is then trained locally at the edge, and the updated parameters are sent back to the central server, where they are aggregated, which takes place iteratively. This setup ensures robustness against malicious cyberattacks as well as reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, to tackle the irregularity in object classification task with a single data modality in such contested environment, a deep learning model incorporating multiple modalities is used as the global model in our proposed federated learning setup. This model can serve as a possible solution in object identification with multi-modal data. We conduct a comprehensive analysis on the importance of multi-modal approach compared to individual modalities within our proposed federate learning setup.

First, the K nearest neighbors (KNN) in the LLE algorithm are selected adaptively by the Gaussian weighted KNN algorithm. Then, the low dimensional sub-epidemic of high dimensional data is extracted by the LLE algorithm, and the mapping matrix from highdimensional data to low-dimensional data is obtained by local linear regression.

In the context of identity-based encryption (IBE), Boldyreva, Goyal, and Kumar (ACM CCS 2008) first showed an efficient revocation method for IBE, and such an IBE scheme with the scalable revocation method is called revocable IBE (RIBE). Seo and Emura (PKC 2013) introduced a new security notion, called decryption key exposure resistance (DKER), which is a desirable security notion for RIBE. However, all existing RIBE schemes that achieve adaptive security with DKER require long public parameters or composite-order bilinear groups. In this paper, we first show an RIBE scheme that (1) satisfies adaptive security; (2) achieves DKER; (3) realizes constant-size public parameters; and (4) is constructed over prime-order bilinear groups. Our core technique relies on Seo and Emura's one (PKC 2013), which transform the Waters IBE (EUROCRYPT 2005) to the corresponding RIBE scheme. Specifically, we construct an IBE scheme that satisfies constant-size public parameters over prime-order groups and some requirements for the Seo-Emura technique, and then transform the IBE scheme to an RIBE scheme. We also discuss how to extend the proposed RIBE scheme to a chosen-ciphertext secure one and server-aided one (ESORICS 2015). (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Most standard-model VRFs rely on admissible hash functions (AHFs) to achieve security against adaptive attacks in the standard model. Known AHF constructions are based on error-correcting codes, which yield asymptotically efficient constructions. However, previous works do not clarify how the code should be instantiated concretely in the real world. The rate and the minimal distance of the selected code have significant impact on the efficiency of the resulting cryptosystem, therefore it is unclear if and how the aforementioned constructions can be used in practice. First, we explain inherent limitations of code-based AHFs. Concretely, we assume that even if we were given codes that achieve the well-known Gilbert-Varshamov or McEliece-Rodemich-Rumsey-Welch bounds, existing AHF-based constructions of verifiable random functions (VRFs) can only be instantiated quite inefficiently. Then we introduce and construct computational AHFs (cAHFs). While classical AHFs are information-theoretic, and therefore work even in presence of computationally unbounded adversaries, cAHFs provide only security against computationally bounded adversaries. However, we show that cAHFs can be instantiated significantly more efficiently. Finally, we use our cAHF to construct the currently most efficient verifiable random function with full adaptive security in the standard model.","Admissible hash functions; Verifiable random functions; Error-correcting codes; Provable security","26th International Conference on Selected Areas in Cryptography (SAC), Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, CANADA, AUG 12-16, 2019","Niehues, D (Corresponding Author), Paderborn Univ, Paderborn, Germany.

This article presents a first multimodal biometric system that combines KINECT gait modality with KINECT face modality utilizing the rank level and the score level fusion. For the KINECT gait modality, a new approach is proposed based on the skeletal information processing. The gait cycle is calculated using three consecutive local minima computed for the distance between left and right ankles. The feature distance vectors are calculated for each person's gait cycle, which allows extracting the biometric features such as the mean and the variance of the feature distance vector. For Kinect face recognition, a novel method based on HOG features has been developed. Then, K-nearest neighbors feature matching algorithm is applied as feature classification for both gait and face biometrics. Two fusion algorithms are implemented. The combination of Borda count and logistic regression approaches are used in the rank level fusion. The weighted sum method is used for score level fusion. The recognition accuracy obtained for multi-modal biometric recognition system tested on KINECT Gait and KINECT Eurocom Face datasets is 93.33% for Borda count rank level fusion, 96.67% for logistic regression rank-level fusion and 96.6% for score level fusion.","Lane-Emden equations; simulated annealing; legendre polynomials; neural network","","Gavrilova, ML (Corresponding Author), Univ Calgary, Dept Comp Sci, Calgary, AB, Canada.

These results are often considered as an intermediate step to design adaptively secure cryptosystems. In fact, selectively secure FE schemes play a role of more than an intermediate step in many cases. If we restrict our attention to group-based constructions, it is not surprising to find several selectively secure FE schemes such that no successful adaptive adversary is found yet and/or it is also believed that no adaptive adversary will be found in practice even in the future. In this paper, we aim at clarifying these beliefs rigorously in the ideal model, called generic group model (GGM). First, we refine the definitions of the GGM and the security notions for FE scheme for clarification. Second, we formalize a group-based FE scheme with some conditions and then show that for any group-based FE scheme satisfying these conditions we can reduce from its selective security in the standard model to adaptive security in the GGM, in particular, regardless of the functionality of FE schemes. Our reduction is applicable to many existing selectively secure FE schemes with various functionalities, e.g., the FE scheme for quadratic functions of Baltico et al. (CRYPTO, 2017), the predicate encryption scheme of Katz et al.

In this paper, we propose a new unbounded RHIBE scheme with decryption key exposure resilience and with short public system parameters, and prove our RHIBE scheme to be adaptively secure. Our system model is scalable inherently to accommodate more levels of user adaptively with no adding workload or restarting the system. By carefully designing the hybrid games, we overcome the subtle obstacle in applying the dual system encryption methodology for the unbounded and revocable HIBE.

These, most of the time, are not convenient for a wide range of users (i.e, the innocent users who do not pose any threat) due to access time delay and several layers of authentication. The proposed security system should exhibit capabilities that support adaptive security procedures for a diverse range of users, so most innocent users require a minimum layer of identity authentication and verification while suspicious users may require passing through some additional layers of security authentication and verification'' [1]. This paper proposes ``a novel smart access control (SAC) system, which can identify and categorize suspicious users from the analysis of one's activities and bio information. The SAC system observes and records users' daily behavioral activities. From the analysis of the collected data, it selectively chooses certain users for additional layers of authentication procedure and quickly isolates those individuals who might pass through scrutiny by security personnel. Due to this adaptive feature, the SAC system not only minimizes delays and provides more convenience to the users but also enhances the security measure'' [1]. Moreover, a novel idea of DPIN, a concept that uses memory and analytical potency of a user to dynamic generation, and updates ones security key is proposed.","","2nd International Symposium on Signal Processing and Intelligent Recognition Systems (SIRS), Trivandrum, INDIA, DEC 16-19, 2015","Penubaku, L (Corresponding Author), Reva Univ, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.

This is in sharp contrast with classical information theory where, according to Shannon, the secret key needs to be at least as long as the message. Here we explore photonic architectures for quantum data locking, where information is encoded in multi-photon states and processed using multi-mode linear optics and photo-detection, with the goal of extending an initial secret key into a longer one. The secret key consumption depends on the number of modes and photons employed. In the no-collision limit, where the likelihood of photon bunching is suppressed, the key consumption is shown to be logarithmic in the dimensions of the system. Our protocol can be viewed as an application of the physics of Boson Sampling to quantum cryptography. Experimental realisations are challenging but feasible with state-of-the-art technology, as techniques recently used to demonstrate Boson Sampling can be adapted to our scheme (e.g., Phys. Rev.

As a result, we have children and students working with devices that are exposed to the highest degree of security issues and threats.

Because of this, it is only natural that security solutions became of significant importance for the tech educational industry. Computers, servers and embedded devices are exposed to the highest degree of security issues and threats since the internet became an essential need. Attacks are continuously evolving, becoming more flexible, adaptable and hard to detect. This made only natural the shift towards adaptive security oriented solutions. One of the security those solutions is represented by anomaly based intrusion detection techniques. Anomaly based intrusion detection systems build a baseline of normal behavior. For a Linux based operating system, which represents a great percent of the platforms used in education, this is accomplished by monitoring a given process or sets of processes. Any significant deviation from the baseline model is flagged as malicious activity. This paper proposes a framework for intrusion detection using system call traces captured from services running on a container. The work done is based on The Australian Defence Force Academy Linux Dataset, better known as ADFA-LD. The analysis is done taking into consideration the temporal allocation of the system calls. The classification module is based on supervised machine learning techniques.

It also makes intelligent decisions that can provide adaptive security management and control. An intelligent cyber security framework using Hyperparameter Tuning based on Regularized Long Short-Term Memory (HT-RLSTM) technique was developed in this work to elevate the security level of core system assets. To detect various attacks, the proposed framework was trained and tested on the collection of data. Owing to missing values, poor scaling, imbalanced and overlapped data, the data was primarily incomplete and inconsistent. To elevate the decision making for detecting attacks, the inconsistent or unstructured data issue was addressed. The missing values were handled by this work along with scaling performance using the developed Kernelized Robust Scaler (KRS). Using the developed Random Over Sample-Based Density-Based Spatial Clustering Associated with Noise (ROS-DBSCAN), the imbalanced and overlapped data were handled, which was followed by the relevant feature selection of data utilizing the Sine Cosine-Based Artificial Jellyfish Search Optimization (SC-AJSO) technique.

To tackle the security issues derived from presentation attacks launched on the biometric capture device, automatic presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been proposed. In spite of their high detection rates on the LivDet databases, the vast majority of the methods rely on the samples provided by traditional capture devices, which may fail to detect more sophisticated presentation attack instrument (PAI) species. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal fingerprint PAD which relies on an analysis of: i) the surface of the finger within the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum, and ii) the inside of the finger thanks to the laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) technology. On the experimental evaluation over a database comprising more than 4700 samples and 35 PAI species, and including unknown attacks to model a realistic scenario, a Detection Equal Error Rate (D-EER) of 0.5% has been achieved. Moreover, for a BPCER <= 0.1% (i.e., highly convenient system), the APCER remains around 3%.","","International Conference on Biometrics (ICB), Crete, GREECE, JUN 04-07, 2019","Gomez-Barrero, M (Corresponding Author), Hsch Darmstadt, Da Scc Biometr & Internet Secur Res Grp, Darmstadt, Germany.

While state-of-the-art classical communication systems routinely aim to maximize this information-carrying capacity via wavelength and spatial-mode division multiplexing, quantum systems based on multi-mode entanglement usually suffer from low state quality, long measurement times, and limited encoding capacity. At the same time, entanglement certification methods often rely on assumptions that compromise security. Here we show the certification of photonic high-dimensional entanglement in the transverse position-momentum degree-of-freedom with a record quality, measurement speed, and entanglement dimensionality, without making any assumptions abolit the state or channels. Using a tailored macro-pixel basis, precise spatial-mode measurements, and a modified entanglement witness, we demonstrate state fidelities of up to 94.4% in a 19-dimensional state-space, entanglement in up to 55 local dimensions, and an entanglement-of-formation of up to 4 obits. Furthermore, our measurement times show an improvement of more than two orders of magnitude over previous state-of-the-art demonstrations.

IOV is an integrated service system that can support the applications for automatic driving, intelligent transport and information services. As the number of incidents on IOV has been on the rise in the past few years, IOV security is becoming increasingly important in the IOV architecture. One of the most notable risks of IOV faces is intelligent terminal security. The vehicle's intelligent terminal can be used to launch for further attacks on the on-board operating system to penetrate into the internal network of connected vehicle, and consequently threaten the safety of the vehicle. Thus, it is of paramount importance that we protect the security of the intelligent terminal. We propose two intelligent terminal based privacy-preserving multi-modal implicit authentication protocols to protect the security of the intelligent terminal in IOV. The proposed protocols use the password and the vehicle owner's behavior features as the authentication factors to protect the security of the intelligent terminal. Since the vehicle owner's behavior features are sensitive and the privacy information of the user must be protected, we also consider the privacy protection of the behavior features. Our protocols do not reveal any information about the vehicle owner's behavior features to the authentication server and the adversary except the ciphertext size of the feature vector. We analyze the security of our proposed protocol and compare them with other related protocols in terms of computation and communications costs. Our results demonstrate that our proposed protocols yield better security and efficiency.","Authentication; connected vehicles; intelligent terminal; Internet of Vehicles; privacy; protocol","","Kumar, N (Corresponding Author), Deemed Univ, Thapar Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Patiala 147004, Punjab, India.

Communication is not secure if the keys are compromised, so we need to generate an adaptive shared secret key. The secret keys are generated adaptively using correlated channel estimation, which reckons on the randomness in the environment and does not require the secrecy of data transferred during the process. This concept is extended in UWA channels with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems and implements a protocol to generate secret keys adaptively based on the channel frequency response (CFR). A secret key generated from the CFR estimation manages the channel coding system, namely a turbo-code. This scheme allows to jointly performing an error control and adaptive coding in only one step. This scheme allows an adaptive security coding without change of the hardware structure of the transceiver devices. In our analysis, BER is used as a measure of the performance of channel estimation and mutual information is used as a measure of secret key performance.","Underwater acoustic communications; secret key generation; channel frequency response; turbo codes","IEEE International Conference on Power, Control, Signals and Instrumentation Engineering (IEEE ICPCSI), Saveetha Engn Coll, Thandalam, INDIA, SEP 21-22, 2017","Murthy, TSN (Corresponding Author), JNTU Kakinada, UCEV, Dept ECE, Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh, India.

Therefore, it becomes imperative to guarantee for all GNSS users the compatibility, interoperability and interchangeability between all these systems. The goal is to ensure that the user's multi-mode receiver can choose and mix signals from different GNSS and SBAS systems to achieve more availability, accuracy and robustness. Attaining that objective will require agreements on frequency plans and signal designs, as well as other details including means to ensure interoperability of system times and geodetic reference systems. This paper suggests a Universal-SBAS (U-SBAS) standard, compatible with all the existing and planned regional GNSS systems (and their evolutions) in the world, like IRNSS, QZSS, PCW, BEIDOU-1, WAAS, EGNOS, SDCM, GAGAN, MSAS. The proposed worldwide multimodal U-SBAS standard carries additional channels (signals and messages) to cover the non-aeronautical specific Safety-of-Life (SoL) services, and also High Precision Positioning Services (HPPS), Position Velocity Time (PVT), authentication services, safety services, scientific application services, High Precision Timing Services (HPTS), etc. U-SBAS is designed to be fully interoperable with the current SBAS standards and to allow significant performance and service improvements in operational, scientific and/or security areas. Finally usage examples of the proposed standard are given for different types of applications such as science, aviation, precise point positioning, timing, security, robust positioning, maritime and reflectometry.","","5th ESA Workshop on Satellite Navigation Technologies / European Workshop on GNSS Signals and Signal Processing (NAVITEC), European Space Res & Technol Ctr, Noordwijk, NETHERLANDS, DEC 08-10, 2010","Sahmoudi, M (Corresponding Author), ISAE, Toulouse, France.

Scientist and researchers have constantly pursued the technology for automated confirmation of the identity of subjects based on measurements of physiological or behavioral traits of humans. But even the best single biometric system suffers from spoof attacks, intra-class variability, noise, susceptibility etc. To address this issue, we develop a hybrid multibiometric system which integrates multi-algorithm and multi-modal approaches of multibiometric system and use bi-level fusion to combine biometric information. We use face, ear and signature biometric traits which are first classified by three classification techniques-multilayer perceptron, Fisherimage and Bayesian network. The outcomes of these classifiers for face are fused by rank fusion method. Outcomes for ear and signature are also fused similarly. The second level fusion occurs when we combine the results of these three rank fusion methods' outcomes for face, ear and signature with decision fusion method. We use Borda count and Borda fuse approaches for rank fusion and majority voting, weighted majority voting and behavioral knowledge space approaches for decision fusion. The final results indicate that this hybrid multi biometric system outperforms the single biometric systems build on the same data using the same classification algorithms. This system can be effectively used in law enforcement or homeland security department or for commercial purposes.","","IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence in Biometrics - Theory, Algorithms and Applications, Nashville, TN, MAR 30-APR 02, 2009","Monwar, MM (Corresponding Author), Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.

Moreover, this electronic setup was used to interrogate a high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR) microbalance, a new sensor class allowing for multi-mode interrogation for gravimetric measurement improvement. The noise source still limiting the system performance is due to the analog-to-digital converter of the microcontroller, thus leaving open degrees-of-freedom for improving the obtained results by optimizing the voltage reference and board layout.

As one of the three major staple foods globally, the quality and safety of rice affect human health as well as social development. To ensure the quality and safety of rice and reduce the flow of problematic rice, a multi-layer blockchain-based rice supply chain refinement supervision model MBRRSM (Multi-blockchain Rice Refined Supervision Model) is proposed from the information level. First, the characteristics of information flow in the rice supply chain are analyzed, and a classification table of key information is constructed. Second, the MBRRSM framework is designed. Based on a multi-party hybrid encryption algorithm, secure multi-party computing algorithm, multi-mode storage mechanism, and SPOP (Supervision Proof of Peers) consensus algorithm, a set of mechanisms is designed for the transmission, use, storage, and consensus of rice data in MBRRSM. Subsequently, the security and performance capabilities of MBRRSM are analyzed. Meanwhile, the SPOP consensus algorithm is analyzed. Finally, a prototype system is built based on MBRRSM and verified through exemplary scenarios in different usage situations. The results show that research on the refined supervision of the rice supply chain based on multi-blockchain can finely supervise all types of data in the rice supply chain, and provide a guarantee for enterprise users to safely transmit and use data with different privacy levels.

Their invisible, unobservable nature also makes them ideal candidates for security interfaces in which users have to enter secret information such as passwords. In particular, researchers have explored this idea through the design of PIN entry authentication systems based on multi-modal combinations of visual and non-visual content or on the recognition of small sets of unimodal haptic or audio stimuli. This paper highlights the benefits and performance limitations of these approaches and introduces an alternative based on unimodal audio or haptic temporal numerosity - the ability to accurately and rapidly determine the number of cues presented in rapid temporal succession. In essence, in a numerosity interface, rather than recognizing distinct cues, users must count the number of times that a single cue occurs. In an iterative process of design and evaluation, three prototypes implementing this concept are presented and studies of their use reported. The results show the fastest PIN entry times and lowest error rates to be 8 s and 2%, figures that improve substantially on previous research. These results are attained while maintaining low levels of workload and substantial resistance to observation attack (as determined via camera attack security studies). In sum, this paper argues that unimodal audio and haptic numerosity is a valuable and relatively unexplored metaphor for non-visual input and demonstrates the validity of this claim in the demanding task of unobservable authentication systems.

However, previously reported afterglow materials are mostly single-mode (one of RTP or TADF only), a tunable multi-mode afterglow emission is still rarely achieved. Herein, we report the temperature-responsive conversion characteristics of TADF and RTP of carbon dots in silica (CDs@SiO2) for the first time. The unique temperature-responsive afterglow characteristics, that is, phosphorescence and TADF can be mutually transformed as the temperature changes, resulting in the free conversion of the RTP/TADF ratio as well as the afterglow color change through simple temperature control. The Si-O network plays multiple roles to strengthen and confine the embedded CDs, thus resulting in ultralong RTP emission and unique afterglow characteristics. Furthermore, CDs@SiO2 exhibited excellent stability against water, acid, alkali, salt and oxidants as well as polar solvents. CDs@SiO2 with unique afterglow characteristics and high stability can have multiple potential applications in rapid fingerprint detection and temperature sensing, especially in advanced temperature-responsive multicolor anti-counterfeiting and encryption.","","","Zheng, MT; Lei, BF; Liu, YL (Corresponding Author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Mat & Energy, Guangdong Prov Engn Technol Res Ctr Opt Agr, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China.

Thus, in this article, we first propose a Threshold Multi-keyword Search (TMS) scheme for cloud-based group data sharing (referred to as basic TMS scheme) by utilizing Shamir's secret sharing technique, to achieve threshold multi-keyword search, threshold decryption, and short record ciphertext size. Then, we extend this basic TMS to realize threshold result verification and threshold traceability (referred to as enhanced TMS). Furthermore, the enhanced TMS is extended to support public result verification and dynamic operations with the public verifier and improved hash tables, respectively. Our formal security analysis proves that both basic TMS and enhanced TMS are semi-adaptively secure and can resist Chosen-Keyword Attack (CKA). Our theoretical evaluation and empirical experiments demonstrate the potential utility of both schemes.","Searchable encryption; threshold access control; threshold multi-keyword search; threshold decryption; short record ciphertext size","","Miao, YB (Corresponding Author), Xidian Univ, Sch Cyber Engn, Xian 710071, Peoples R China.

To defend against APT attacks, organizations should sufficiently understand these attacks based on the attack elements and their relations and actively defend against these attacks in multiple dimensions. Most organizations perform risk management to manage their information security. Generally, they use the information system risk assessment (ISRA). However, the method has difficulties supporting sufficiently analyzing security risks and actively responding to these attacks due to the limitations of asset-driven qualitative evaluation activities. In this paper, we propose a threat-driven risk assessment method. This method can evaluate how dangerous APT attacks are for an organization, analyze security risks from multiple perspectives, and support establishing an adaptive security strategy.","advanced persistent threat; risk-aware problem domain ontology; business process-based asset identification; threat-driven risk assessment; evidence-based risk evaluation","30th IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE), ELECTR NETWORK, AUG 15-19, 2022","Park, SH (Corresponding Author), Ajou Univ, Dept Artificial Intelligence, Suwon, South Korea.

By comparing both these systems, it is clear that multi-modal biometric systems are gathering more popularity as it has the capability of dealing challenges involved in uni-modal biometric systems such as: non-universality, captured data noise, variations between same class, spoof attacks and unacceptable error rates.

To meet the needs of communication, a large variety of proprietary protocols have emerged in the field of industrial control. The protocol field is often trusted in the implementation of industrial control terminal code. If attackers modify the data of these fields using the protocol defect, the operation of the program can be controlled and the entire system will be affected. To cope with such security threats, academia and industry generally adopt fuzz test methods. However, the current industrial control protocol fuzz test methods generally have low code coverage, where unified description models are missing and test cases are not targeted. A method of fuzzification processing combined with dynamic multi-modal sensor communication data is proposed. To track the program execution, the dynamic pollution analysis is used to search for the input fields that affect the execution of the conditional branch and capture the dependencies between the conditional branches to guide the grammar generation of test cases, which can increase the chances of executing deep code. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the validity and code coverage of test cases to a certain extent and greatly increases the probability of anomaly detection in the protocol implementation.","Fuzz test; Dynamic taint analysis; Dependence relationship; Grammar generation","","Li, QM (Corresponding Author), Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China.

This is because biometric information is unique, unforgettable and non-transferable. However the biometric-attribute measurements are noisy and most of the existing encryption systems can not support the biometric-attribute encryption. Additionally, the previous fuzzy encryption schemes only achieve the selective security which is a weak security model. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a new fuzzy encryption scheme based on the lattice in this letter. The proposed scheme is based on a hierarchical identity-based encryption with fixed-dimensional private keys space and thus has short public parameters and short private keys, which results in high computation efficiency. Furthermore, it achieves the strong security, i.e., adaptive security.

In the first stage, with day-ahead PV and load predictions, the central controller (CC) performs optimal power flow (OPF) to determine the hourly dispatch of on-load tap changers (OLTC) and capacitor banks (CBs). In the second stage, the ADN is partitioned into different zones only based on PV and load types. The zone controllers (ZC), which is formulated by deep neural networks (DNN), then communicate with their neighbors and track the optimal total reactive power support of PVs in each zone. In the offline training process, an analytical derivation to minimize power losses is also provided that can help the input and output selection of DNN. To online dispatch reactive power for individual utility-scale and customer-owned PVs in corresponding zones, a multi-mode reactive power allocation strategy is proposed. Three different modes namely loss reduction mode (LRM), fair power sharing mode (FPM) and voltage security mode (VSM) are designed to meet varying operation requirements, which can mitigate voltage violations with fair participation for customers and reduced power losses for system operators. Numerical simulations are performed on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in finding a trade-off between voltage security and loss minimization with fairness.","Voltage control; Reactive power; Optimization; Capacitors; Voltage measurement; Training; Security; Combined central and distributed; deep neural networks; multi-mode reactive power allocation; Volt; Var control; customer-owned PVs","","Qiu, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Sydney, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.

Alone, Uber and Lyft are providing over 11 million rides per day (DMR, 2018a,b). These services are provided using a client-server infrastructure. The client is a smartphone-based application used for: (i) registering riders and drivers, (ii) connecting drivers with riders, (iii) car-sharing to share the expenses, minimize traffic congestion and saving traveling time, (iv) allowing customers to book their rides. The server typically, run by multi-national companies such as Uber, Ola, Lyft, BlaBlaCar, manages drivers and customers registrations, allocates ride-assignments, sets tariffs, guarantees payments, ensures safety and security of riders, etc. However, the reliability of drivers have emerged as a critical problem, and as a consequence, issues related to riders safety and security have started surfacing. The lack of robust driver verification mechanisms has opened a room to an increasing number of misconducts (i.e., drivers subcontracting ride-assignments to an unauthorized person, registered drivers sharing their registration with other people whose eligibility to drive is not justified, etc.) (Horwitz, 2015; USAtoday, 2016). This paper proposes DRIVERAUTH - a novel risk-based multi-modal biometric-based authentication solution, to make the on-demand ride and ride-sharing services safer and more secure for riders. DRIVERAUTH utilizes three biometric modalities, i.e., swipe, text-independent voice, and face, in a multi-modal fashion to verify the identity of registered drivers. We evaluated DRIVERAUTH on a dataset of 10,320 samples collected from 86 users and achieved a True Acceptance Rate (TAR) of 96.48% at False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.02% using Ensemble Bagged Tree (EBT) classifier.

The results revealed key problem areas which related to a lack of user awareness and acceptance. One of the key problems was that 79% of respondents indicated they have never had any security awareness sessions or training. Insights from the survey were used to create a framework. The framework extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance of User Technology (UTAUT) model, to address awareness and acceptance problems. The focus was on how user attitudes, beliefs and personal knowledge influence acceptance and usage of access-control technology.

Decomposition of problems and systems into smaller, more manageable units has been at the heart of software engineering practice for decades. ``Separation of concerns'' gives software engineers the conceptual and practical tools to focus their attention, and their tools, on the parts of the problem or solution to which they are best suited. Perhaps one of the earliest boundaries used to separate concerns is that which exists between hardware and software - once that boundary is drawn, software engineers were able to focus their attention on the development of software within the hardware boundaries chosen. There has however, been a steady erosion of such boundaries: digital and physical connectivity have become the norm, and increasingly such connectivity can be ad hoc, spontaneous, and often unplanned (perhaps best exemplified by the Internet of Things paradigm). Moreover, the fluid and disappearing boundaries between technology and people have radically affected social behaviours (again, perhaps well exemplified by the proliferation of mobile and ubiquitous computing such as wearable and `smart' technologies used in variety of personal and community settings). Such convergence between digital, physical, and social spaces has provided exciting opportunities for software engineers to, literally, `cross boundaries', and, as a result, to have an impact on the physical and social worlds in which the software they build will operate. But in this brave new world with porous boundaries, security engineering and privacy management challenges abound. Effective security depends on the ability to control access to assets protected by boundaries [2]. Effective privacy management depends on informed, consensual sharing of information across boundaries [4]. Our thesis is that, although increasingly invisible, and rightly so, explicit awareness and sometimes representation of boundaries in cyber-physical-social systems facilitate good old fashioned separation of concerns, which in turn enables more effective software engineering of secure, privacy-aware software [5, 6]. We support our thesis with examples from our research in adaptive security [7] and privacy [1].","adaptive security and privacy; cyber-physical-social systems","IEEE/ACM 3rd International Workshop on Software Engineering for Smart Cyber-Physical Systems (SEsCPS), Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA, MAY 21, 2017","Nuseibeh, B (Corresponding Author), Open Univ, Comp, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England.

In particular, in the context of adaptive security, the so-called ``simulator commitment problem'' arises: once a party gets corrupted, an efficient simulator is unable to be consistent with its pre-corruption outputs. A natural question is whether such impossibility results are unavoidable or only artifacts of frameworks being too restrictive. In this work, we propose a novel type of composable security statement that evades the commitment problem. Our new type is able to express the composable guarantees of schemes that previously did not have a clear composable understanding. To this end, we leverage the concept of system specifications in the Constructive Cryptography framework, capturing the conjunction of several interval-wise guarantees, each specifying the guarantees between two events. We develop the required theory and present the corresponding new composition theorem. We present three applications of our theory. First, we show in the context of symmetric encryption with adaptive corruption how our notion naturally captures the expected confidentiality guarantee-the messages remain confidential until either party gets corrupted-and that it can be achieved by any standard semantically secure scheme (negating the need for non-committing encryption). Second, we present a composable formalization of (so far only known to be standalone secure) commitment protocols, which is instantiable without a trusted setup like a CRS. We show it to be sufficient for being used in coin tossing over the telephone, one of the early intuitive applications of commitments. Third, we reexamine a result by Hofheinz, Matt, and Maurer [Asiacrypt'15] implying that IND-ID-CPA security is not the right notion for identity-based encryption, unmasking this claim as an unnecessary framework artifact.","","40th Annual International Cryptology Conference (CRYPTO), ELECTR NETWORK, AUG 17-21, 2020","Jost, D; Maurer, U (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.

It is the first and most critical link in the security chain that restricts access to system and data resources to legitimate users only. The advantages of using biometrics to verify a person's identity over using passwords or tokens have been broadly presented. However, recent research has revealed that biometric technologies can be defeated with low-tech and cheap materials. This presents a new challenge at a time when people are encouraged to use biometrics as a means to enhance network security. Since biometrics are not secrets, there exists a risk of them being captured, copied, and forged. In this paper, the biometric authentication's vulnerability to various attacks is analyzed, and efforts to defeat the spoofing attacks are presented.

This paper presents a new generic approach to proving upper bounds on the information-theoretic distinguishing advantage (from an ideal system) for a combined system, assuming upper bounds of certain types for the component systems. For a general type of combination operation of systems, including the XOR of functions or the cascade of permutations, we prove two amplification theorems. The first is a, product theorem, in the spirit of XOR-lemmas: The distinguishing advantage of the combination of two systems is at most twice the product of the individual distinguishing advantages. This bound is optimal. The second theorem states that the combination of systems is secure against some strong class of distinguishers, assuming only that the components are secure against some weaker class of distinguishers. A key technical tool of the paper is the proof of a tight two-way correspondence, previously only known to hold in one direction, between the distinguishing advantage of two systems and the probability of winning an appropriately defined game.","","27th Annual International Cryptology Conference, Santa Barbara, CA, AUG 19-23, 2007","Maurer, U (Corresponding Author), ETH, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.

Such formatted EHRs form an attribute-value type database, where both the attribute values and unique identities can serve as keywords for searching. Since EHRs are very sensitive, they are always encrypted before being outsourced, which makes retrieval of target EHRs by either identity or attribute value hard. Moreover, the EHRs are encrypted by different doctors, a researcher, who is delegated to research a certain kind of disease, cannot find out all corresponding EHRs due to the difference of encryption keys. In this article, we construct a triple dictionary index structure for the attribute-value type database to allow a researcher to retrieve encrypted EHRs by the identity and attribute value and to perform dynamic operations over them. We employ an identity server to assist doctors in generating encryption keys via an oblivious way. By doing so, the researcher can retrieve encrypted EHRs without leaking any information to the identity server.

As with cloud computing, it also faces the challenge of how to securely distribute sensitive data. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based Broadcast Encryption (CP-ABBE) can protect sensitive data and provide fine-grained access control with user revocation. However, existing CP-ABBE schemes suffer many limitations when implemented in a fog computing environment: a single authority performs poorly in handling requests or data from many IoT devices, leading to system delays or limited functionality; expensive decryption costs make the computation and storage overheads unfriendly to devices with limited resources; these schemes are only proven selectively secure, meaning that security was proven in a weaker model. In this paper, using threshold secret sharing and decryption delegation, we propose an adaptively secure attribute-based multi-authority broadcast encryption (MA-ABBE) scheme that breaks through these limitations. The comparison and analysis results show that our scheme is practical and achieves adaptive security, enables user-side fast decryption and low storage overhead, and provides a secure and efficient option for protecting sensitive data in fog computing environments.","Attributed-based broadcast encryption; Fog computing; Multi-authority; Adaptively secure","","Ling, YH (Corresponding Author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai Key Lab Trustworthy Comp, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.

Whereas delegation of rights has been addressed in the seminal paper by Goyal et al. in 2006, introducing KP-ABE, this feature has almost been neglected in all subsequent works in favor of better security levels. However, in multi-device scenarios, this is quite important to allow users to independently authorize their own devices, and thus to delegate their initial rights with possibly more restrictions to their everyday-use devices. But then, one may also require tracing capabilities in case of corrupted devices and anonymity for the users and their devices. To this aim, we define a new variant of KP-ABE including delegation, with switchable attributes, in both the ciphertexts and the keys, and new indistinguishability properties. We then provide a concrete and efficient instantiation with adaptive security under the sole SXDH assumption in the standard model. We eventually explain how this new primitive can address all our initial goals.","","13th Conference on Security and Cryptography for Networks (SCN), Amalfi, ITALY, SEP 12-14, 2022","Gouriou, L (Corresponding Author), Leanear, Paris, France.

It is based upon the ever-secure Advanced Encryption Standard Cipher Block Chaining (AES-CBC) mode of encryption and Indexing-First One (IFO) hashing for the generation of the secret keys. The proposed system utilizes two biometrics of the user, the iris and the fingerprint, but instead of using the features of the biometrics directly, they are hashed through the IFO process to create a secret key that can be revoked and regenerated in case of a compromise ensuring the security of the users biometrics. The IFO hashes obtained from the biometric feature vectors are then used as two different secret keys in a two round AES-CBC system to encrypt the medical image. The medical image can be decrypted by performing the AES-CBC rounds in reverse with the correct keys, meaning that with high probability, only the correct user will be able to decrypt the image. This encryption technique improves upon many existing medical encryption schemes based on biometrics, which do not take the protection of the biometric template into account. We were able to perform one full key generation, encryption and decryption in .027 seconds.

This paper focuses on recent developments in hollow fiber technology geared specifically for infrared spectroscopy, including single mode beam delivery with relatively low bending loss. Results are presented from tests conducted using both Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCL) and CO2 lasers operating in the LWIR wavelength regime. Single-mode waveguides are shown to effectively deliver beams with relatively low loss (similar to 1 dB/m) and relatively high beam quality. The fibers are also shown to effectively mode-filter the ``raw'' multi-mode output from a QCL, in effect damping out the higher order modes to produce a circularly symmetric Gaussian-like beam profile.","Infrared fiber optics; hollow waveguides; infrared spectroscopy; long-wave infrared (LWIR); mid-wave infrared (MWIR); mid-infrared; quantum cascade laser","Conference on Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosives (CBRNE) Sensing XII, Orlando, FL, APR 26-28, 2011","Kriesel, JM (Corresponding Author), Optoknowledge Syst Inc, 19805 Hamilton Ave, Torrance, CA 90502 USA.

To support more secret keys associated with nodes, it is often expected that the tree has a sufficiently large depth. This places a burden on employing it implicitly or explicitly in real world. In this work, we show how to compress linear-size public key down to constant-size public key and give our construction featuring constant-size public key in the standard model. We prove that our construction achieves an improved security, adaptive security, under the matrix decision Diffie-Hellman assumption, which is a generalization of standard k-Lin assumption. Moreover, our key-generation, key-derivation and encryption algorithms have lower time complexity than that of the prior construction, leading to further efficiency improvements. To illustrate these improvements in practice, we give an implementation of our construction and the prior one and then evaluate the performance in the tree depth.","forward security; binary tree encryption; constant-size public key; standard model; adaptive security","","Chen, J (Corresponding Author), East China Normal Univ, Software Engn Inst, 3663 North Zhongshan Rd, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.

The first scheme has constant-size ciphertexts whereas the second one is weakly attribute hiding. IPE2 is derived from the identity-based encryption scheme of Jutla Roy (Asiacrypt 2013), that was extended from tag-based quasi-adaptive non-interactive zero-knowledge (QA-NIZK) proofs for linear subspaces of vector spaces over bilinear groups. The verifier common reference string (CRS) in these tag-based systems are split into two parts, that are combined during verification. We consider an alternate form of the tag-based QA-NIZK proof with a single verifier CRS that already includes a tag, different from the one defining the language. The verification succeeds as long as the two tags are unequal. Essentially, we embed a two-equation revocation mechanism in the verification. The new QA-NIZK proof system leads to IPE1, a constant-sized ciphertext IPE scheme with very short ciphertexts. Both the IPE schemes are obtained by applying the n-equation revocation technique of Attrapadung and Libert (PKC 2010) to the corresponding identity based encryption schemes and proved secure under SXDH assumption. As an application, we show how our schemes can be specialised to obtain the first fully secure identity-based broadcast encryption based on SXDH with a trade-off among the public parameters, ciphertext and key sizes, all of them being sub-linear in the maximum number of recipients of a broadcast.","Inner-product encryption; Attribute-hiding; Constant-size ciphertexts; Quasi-adaptive non-interactive zero knowledge proofs","14th International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security (ACNS), Guildford, ENGLAND, JUN 19-22, 2016","Ramanna, SC (Corresponding Author), ENS Lyon, Lab LIP, Lyon, France.

This omnipresence as well as the wireless nature of many embedded applications give rise to the need for sophisticated security and privacy preserving mechanisms. Trusted Computing is a promising new approach for computer security in which a system should be permanently in a well-defined and therefore trustworthy state. The adaption of such concepts for embedded systems with application specific requirements and limitations can provide promising security benefits. Besides, both in the industrial and academical sector a trend has become apparent to develop chips which include programmable cores as well as system reconfigurable components. Resultant chips will not be a single part of an embedded system anymore but rather can be used for the development of a whole system. Thus, FPGAs have become integral parts of embedded computing platforms. The reconfigurability of FPGAs offers major advantages when using them for cryptographic applications and it is suggested that an adaptive hardware-based trust anchor can greatly enhance the overall security level of an embedded system. In this paper we propose a concept of how such an adaptive security module could be designed as well as some possible fields of application. A key focus of this ongoing research work is the development of a flexible FPGA-based security architecture.","","International Conference on Applied Electronics, Pilsen, CZECH REPUBLIC, SEP 05-07, 2012","Schramm, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Appl Sci Deggendorf, Deggendorf, Germany.

It is useful in many settings, including proactive security, adaptive security, forward security, and intrusion resilience. Protocols for all these settings typically assume the ability to perfectly erase information. Unfortunately, as amply demonstrated in the systems literature, perfect erasures are hard to implement in practice. We propose a model of partial erasures where erasure instructions leave almost all the data erased intact, thus giving the honest players only a limited capability for disposing of old data. Nonetheless, we provide a general compiler that transforms any secure protocol using perfect erasures into one that maintains the same security properties when only partial erasures are available. The key idea is a new redundant representation of secret data which can still be computed on, and yet is rendered useless when partially erased. We prove that any such a compiler must incur a cost in additional storage, and that our compiler is near optimal in terms of its storage overhead.","mobile adversary; proactive security; adaptive security; forward security; intrusion resilience; universal hashing; partial erasures; secure multiparty computation; randomness extractors","35th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming, Reykjavik, ICELAND, JUL 07-11, 2008","Canetti, R (Corresponding Author), IBM Corp, TJ Watson Res Ctr, Armonk, NY 10504 USA.

Security of online e-commerce over the Internet is provided through Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS). The SSL/TLS uses public key cryptographic algorithms which are computational intensive due to the modular multiplications. Therefore, SSL/TLS servers often become overloaded while performing public key decryptions when the simultaneous requests increase rapidly. Overload can lead e-commerce applications to considerable revenue losses, response times may grow to unacceptable levels and as a result the server may saturate even crash. So load management of SSL/TLS web server is a critical issue in e-commerce. The proposed work in this paper is to manage load on the server by applying Adaptive SSL policy and session handling mechanism. This policy is self-adaptive security, which offers great potential in providing timely and fine grained security control on server, by runtime adaptation of cryptographic algorithm.

Lamb wave-based structural health monitoring (SHM) has been proved to be effective in online structural damage detection and evaluation; furthermore, the characteristic parameters of the multi-mode Lamb wave varies in response to different types of damage in the composite material. This paper studies the damage identification approach for composite structures using the Lamb wave and the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The algorithm and principle of the GMM, and the parameter estimation, is introduced. Multistatistical characteristic parameters of the excited Lamb waves are extracted, and the parameter space with reduced dimensions is adopted by principal component analysis (PCA). The damage identification system using the GMM is then established through training. Experiments on a glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composite laminate plate are conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach in terms of damage classification. The experimental results show that different types of damage can be identified according to the value of the likelihood function of the GMM.","Lamb waves; structural health monitoring; Gaussian mixture model; multi-statistical characteristic parameter; damage identification","","Wang, Q (Corresponding Author), Nanjing Univ Post & Telecommun, Coll Automat, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.

First, we propose an mHealth sensing protocol that provides strong security and privacy properties at the link layer, with low energy overhead, suitable for low-power sensors. The protocol uses three novel techniques: adaptive security, to dynamically modify transmission overhead; MAC striping, to make forgery difficult even for small-sized Message Authentication Codes; and asymmetric resource requirements, in recognition of the limited resources in tiny mHealth sensors.

Various intrusion detection techniques are used, but their performance is an issue. Intrusion detection performance depends on accuracy, which needs to improve to decrease false alarms and to increase the detection rate. To resolve concerns on performance, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine (SVM), and other techniques have been used in recent work. Such techniques indicate limitations and are not effcient for use in large data sets, such as system and network data. The intrusion detection system is used in analyzing huge traffc data; thus, an effcient classifcation technique is necessary to overcome the issue. This problem is considered in this paper.

Current systems are typically hybrid assemblies of packaged photonic devices where printed circuit boards often serve to route electrical signals and power, and in some cases, have runs of optical fibers. We present a flexible, low cost assembly method of optical interconnects for photonic systems that could enable higher transmission rates, lower power requirements, improved signal integrity and timing, less heat generation, and improved security of communication signals. The new process is based on laser enhanced direct print additive manufacturing (LE-DPAM) that combines fused deposition modeling (FDM) of plastic, micro-dispensing of rubber-like materials, and picosecond laser subtraction. The process is demonstrated by fabricating few-mode and multi-mode optical fibers in a controlled manner such that compact, 3-dimensional optical interconnects can be printed along non-lineal paths. We have produced working optical interconnects with fiber core diameters from 70-mu m to as small as 12-mu m. Our results demonstrate surface roughness of less than 100 nm, and optical transmitted power of 63% that of a commercial fiber, for proof of concept devices. We anticipate these devices to be a starting point in the development of more sophisticated electro-optical computing devices using this new LE-DPAM technique. The LE-DPAM approach could lead to large scale integrated photonic computing devices that would replace our current generation of servers, computers, and phones.","Optical fiber interconnects; Additive manufacturing; 3D printing; Laser enhanced direct print additive manufacturing","","Bhethanabotla, VR (Corresponding Author), Univ S Florida, Funct Mat & Mfg Inst, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.

Given its appealing usability, such zero-effort authentication has already been deployed in the real-world where a computer terminal or a vehicle can be unlocked by the mere proximity of an authentication token (e.g., a smartphone). However, existing systems based on a single authentication factor contains one major security weakness - unauthorized physical access to the token, e.g., during lunch-time or upon theft, allows the attacker to have unfettered access to the terminal. We introduce ZEMFA, a zero-effort multi-factor authentication system based on multiple authentication tokens and multi-modal behavioral biometrics. Specifically, ZEMFA utilizes two types of authentication tokens, a smartphone and a smartwatch (or a bracelet) and two types of gait patterns captured by these tokens, mid/lower body movements measured by the phone and wrist/arm movements captured by the watch. Since a user's walking or gait pattern is believed to be unique, only that user (no impostor) would be able to gain access to the terminal even when the impostor is given access to both of the authentication tokens. We present the design and implementation of ZEMFA. We demonstrate that ZEMFA offers a high degree of detection accuracy, based on multi-sensor and multi-device fusion. We also show that ZEMFA can resist active attacks that attempt to mimic a user's walking pattern, especially when multiple devices are used.","Authentication; Biometrics; Walking-pattern; Phone; Wearables; Sensors; Context","17th International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust (PST), Fredericton, CANADA, AUG 26-28, 2019","Shrestha, B (Corresponding Author), VISA Inc, Austin, TX 78759 USA.

It is observed that, when a broadcast encryption scheme is deployed for secret escrows, a dishonest dealer can read the escrowed secrets without leaving any witnesses. We present a new broadcast encryption paradigm referred to as fully distributed broadcast encryption (FDBE) without suffering from this vulnerability. In the new paradigm, there are multiple dealers, and by contacting a number of them equal to a threshold or more, any user can join the system; then the secrets can be encrypted to any subset of users and only the intended receivers can decrypt, while an attacker cannot get any information about the encrypted message even if the attacker controls all the users outside the receiver set and corrupts some dealers, provided that the number of corrupted dealers is less than a threshold. We realize the first fully distributed broadcast encryption scheme which is proven secure under the decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponentiation assumption in the standard model. A variant is also shown to achieve sub-linear complexity in terms of public key, decryption key and ciphertext, comparable to up-to-date regular broadcast encryption schemes without robustness and strong security against misbehaving dealers.","Broadcast encryption; Bilinear pairing; Provable security; Secrets escrow; Access control","5th International Conference on Provable Security, (ProvSec 2011), Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA, OCT 16-18, 2011","Wu, QH (Corresponding Author), Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Comp Eng & Maths, UNESCO Chair Data Privacy, Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain.

Machine learning techniques can play a pivotal role for the contextual processing of multimodal data, however, due to the low computational power of the HA devices, the data must be processed either on the edge or cloud which, in turn, poses privacy concerns for the users' sensitive data. Existing literature proposes several techniques for data encryption but their computational complexity is a major bottleneck to meet strict latency requirements for the development of future multi-modal hearing aids. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a novel real-time audio/visual data encryption scheme based on chaos-based encryption using the Tangent-Delay Ellipse Reflecting Cavity-Map System (TD-ERCS) and Non-linear Chaotic (NCA) Algorithms. The results achieved against different security analysis parameters such as Correlation Coefficient, Unified Averaged Changed Intensity (UACI), Key Sensitivity Analysis, Number of Changing Pixel Rate (NPCR), Mean-Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Entropy test, and Chi-test, indicate that the proposed scheme is more secure with increased key-space against modern brute-force attacks and lightweight as compared to existing schemes.","","5th IEEE Conference on Dependable and Secure Computing (IEEE DSC), Edinburgh Napier Univ, Merchiston Campus, Edinburgh, SCOTLAND, JUN 22-24, 2022","Shah, AA (Corresponding Author), Edinburgh Napier Univ, Sch Comp, Edinburgh, Scotland.

Based on this scheme, an approach enabling various queries on the encrypted industrial data stream is proposed. The adaptive security of our proposed underlying functional encryption scheme can be proven under general subgroup decision assumptions, and our scheme has the smaller public key, the smaller secret key, and the smaller ciphertext size compared to the related schemes.

Moreover, transmit power control is employed to enhance the rate of packet reception of the legitimate receiver.

Dual system encryption methodology is developed to guide design and analysis of various functional encryption schemes (FEs) with adaptive security. Observing the compatibility of dual system methodology and leakage-resilience, Lewko et al. present constructions of a number of strong leakage-resilient functional encryptions. In particular, they present fully secure identity-based encryption (IBE), hierarchical IBE (HIBE) and attribute-based encryption (ABE) satisfying the continual memory leakage (CML) model, one of the strongest models that allows continuous leakage on both user and master secret keys. Inspired by the recent work from Attrapadung on pair encodings which greatly simplifies the design and analysis of FE, we propose a generic framework for constructing fully secure FEs in the CML model (LR-FEs). Specifically, our framework ``compiles'' predicate encodings into fully secure LR-FEs in a two-step process. Firstly, we propose a generic transformation of pair encoding schemes into their leakage-resilient forms. Next, we present another conversion that turns leakage-resilient pair encodings into fully secure LR-FEs. Our framework is highly compatible with Attrapadung's, meaning that it is applicable to many existing pair encoding schemes. The contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, our framework simplifies the design and analysis of LR-FEs into the design and analysis of predicate encodings. Secondly, our framework allows us to improve the security of some existing LR-FEs, such as LR-IBE with a tighter reduction. Thirdly, we discover new adaptively secure LR-FEs, including FE for regular languages, ABE for large universe and ABE with short ciphertext.","","21st Australasian Conference on Information Security and Privacy (ACISP), Melbourne, AUSTRALIA, JUL 04-06, 2016","Au, MH (Corresponding Author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

It is worth noting that while extensive efforts have been devoted to developing fluorescent Si-based structures, there currently exist no examples of Si-based materials featuring phosphorescence emission, severely limiting Si-based wide-ranging optical applications. To address this critical issue, we herein introduce a kind of Si-based material, in which metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are in-situ growing on the surface of Si nanoparticles (SiNPs) assisted by microwave irradiation. Of particular significance, the resultant materials, i.e., MOFs-encapsulated SiNPs (MOFs@SiNPs) could exhibit pH-responsive fluorescence, whose maximum emission wavelength is red-shifted from 442 to 592 nm when the pH increases from 2 to 13. More importantly, distinct room-temperature phosphorescence (maximum emission wavelength: 505 nm) could be observed in this system, with long lifetime of 215 ms. Taking advantages of above-mentioned unique optical properties, the MOFs@SiNPs are further employed as high-quality anti-counterfeiting inks for advanced encryption. In comparison to conventional fluorescence anti-counterfeiting techniques (static fluorescence outputs are generally used, thus being easily duplicated and leading to counterfeiting risk), pH-responsive fluorescence and room-temperature phosphorescence of the resultant MOFs@SiNPs-based ink could offer advanced multi-modal security, which is therefore capable of realizing higher-level information security against counterfeiting.","silicon nanohybrids; pH-responsive fluorescence; room-temperature phosphorescence; multi-modal anti-counterfeiting","","He, Y (Corresponding Author), Soochow Univ, Lab Nanoscale Biochem Anal, Inst Funct Nano & Soft Mat FUNSOM, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R China.

Various solutions based on Game theory have been recently proposed which dealt with security aspects of wireless sensor networks(WSNs). However, the nodes have limited capability of rationality and evolutionary learning which makes it unfavorable to apply conventional game theory in WSNs. Evolutionary Game Theory(EGT) relies on bounded rationality assumption which is in harmony with the wireless sensor networks characteristics. Based on EGT, authors propose an adaptive security model for WSNs for the selection of cryptographic protocols during runtime. The authors formulate this selection in WSNs with the help of an evolutionary game to obtain the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the system. In this model, the sensor nodes dynamically adapt their defensive strategies to attain the most efficient defense, corresponding to the attackers' varied strategies. Further, the simulations convey that the proposed system converges rapidly to the Evolutionary Stable Strategy. Not only the system converges, but also forms a stable system which was verified by deliberately destabilizing the system. Results show that the nodes quickly return to ESS even after perturbation.

In their technique, two computational assumptions that achieve selective and co-selective security proofs lead to adaptive security of an encryption scheme. Later, pair encoding framework was introduced by Attrapadung in Eurocrypt'14. The pair encoding framework generalises the computational hiding technique for functional encryption (FE). It has been used to achieve a number of new FE schemes such as FE for regular languages and unbounded attribute based encryption allowing multi-use of attributes. Nevertheless, the generalised construction of Attrapadung's pair encoding for those schemes is adaptively secure only in composite order groups, which leads to efficiency loss. It remains a challenging task to explore constructions in prime order groups for gaining efficiency improvement, which leaves the research gap in the existing literature. In this work, we aim to address this drawback by proposing a new generalised construction for pair encodings in prime order groups.

Our scheme is fully collusion-resistant against any number of colluders, and can be generalized to an identity-based broadcast system with short parameters. Thus, we reclaim the problem of optimal broadcast encryption from the land of ``Obfustopia''. Our main technical contribution is a ciphertext policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE) scheme which achieves special efficiency properties - its ciphertext size, secret key size, and public key size are all independent of the size of the circuits supported by the scheme. We show that this special CP-ABE scheme implies BE with optimal parameters; but it may also be of independent interest.

Following it, a malicious user can eavesdrop on other users' downloads by transforming training sequences. To prevent this attack, we propose a secure CSI estimation scheme for instantaneous CSI.

Results: We propose a machine learning model that leverages both genotype and phenotype measurements by fusing genetic variants with multiple data sources collected by unmanned aerial systems. We use a deep multiple instance learning framework with an attention mechanism that sheds light on the importance given to each input during prediction, enhancing interpretability. Our model reaches 0.75460.024 Pearson correlation coefficient when predicting yield in similar environmental conditions; a 34.8% improvement over the genotype-only linear baseline (0.55960.050). We further predict yield on new lines in an unseen environment using only genotypes, obtaining a prediction accuracy of 0.38660.010, a 13.5% improvement over the linear baseline. Our multi-modal deep learning architecture efficiently accounts for plant health and environment, distilling the genetic contribution and providing excellent predictions.

If the vulnerabilities found are not amended, it leads to cyber-attacks such as Structured Query Language Injection Attack (SQLIA) performed by certain parties which enable them to gain unauthorized data access. To cater security issues, variety of security frameworks for secure software development life cycle (SDLC) were introduced. Secure SDLC is created by integrating security-related activities to an each phase of in used development methodologies such as waterfall model or agile model. However, the application security problem continues to grow. Strict, complicated and heavyweight frameworks are underutilized due to several factors. The factors that influence the implementation of secure SDLC identified in public sector (the scope is State Secretary Offices in Malaysia) are inadequate development timeline, improper development team size and less awareness of team members' workload. It is agreed that integrating security at earlier (requirement and design) phase is the most effective and cheapest way to develop secure web application. Hence, an adaptive secure SDLC model is proposed to integrate security activities using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) focusing on the influence factors as the main criteria and meet the international and local secure frameworks standards. The proposed model will recommend adaptive security activities as a guideline to be applied at earlier phases of SDLC to help eliminate/minimize the web application vulnerabilities and increase the application security and implemented as a proof-of-concept prototype at selected Malaysian public sector for in-house web application development.","web application; security activities; secure SDLC; in-house web application development; public sector","IEEE Conference on Application, Information and Network Security (AINS), MALAYSIA, NOV 21-22, 2018","Jakeri, MM (Corresponding Author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Fac Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Seri Iskandar, Perak, Malaysia.

It is applicable in a generic manner to any predicates. Previous generic frameworks of this kind are given only in bilinear group settings, where applicable predicate classes are limited. Our framework provides an abstraction of dual system paradigms over composite-order graded multilinear encoding schemes in a black-box manner. As applications, we propose new fully secure ABE systems for general predicates, namely, ABE for circuits. We obtain two schemes for each of key-policy (KP) and ciphertext-policy (CP) variants of ABE. All of our four fully secure schemes can deal with unbounded-size circuits, while enjoy succinctness, meaning that the key and ciphertext sizes are (less than or) proportional to corresponding circuit sizes. In the CP-ABE case, no scheme ever achieves such properties, even when considering selectively secure systems. Furthermore, our second KP-ABE achieves constant-size ciphertexts, whereas our second CP-ABE achieves constant-size keys. Previous ABE systems for circuits are either selectively secure (Gorbunov et al. STOC'13, Garg et al. Crypto'13, and subsequent works), or semi-adaptively secure (Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan Crypto' 16), or fully-secure but not succinct and restricted to bounded-size circuits (Garg et al. ePrint 2014/622, and Garg et al.

The nuclear power plants operation experience shows that the dangerous defects could produce in the material of Bottom Mounted Instrument and J type weld(hereinafter BMI). In early nuclear power plants, the BMI is made of corrosion-sensitive materials (such as Alloy 600). The stress corrosion crack is easy to grow up and destroy the integrity of RPV in operation. Therefore, inspection for BMI during the service stage is necessary to ensure the integrity of the primary circuit pressure boundary. The BMI is general made of Alloy 600 or Alloy 690 and penetrate the reactor pressure vessel lower head vertically to form J type weld on the inner wall of the RPV lower head. The inner diameter is generally 15 to 16 mm and the wall thickness is about 15 mm. In order to improve the welding performance, the dissimilar metal J-type weld groove is usually overlaid with nickel-based pre-heap edge. The component structural and material characteristics have brought great difficulties to the test technology research as well as the location. In this paper, the main failure modes of BMI are introduced and the technical requirements of in-service inspections are presented. The technical scheme and inspection system are designed according to the above requirements and weld structural characteristics. Both UT and ET methods are used for the inspection. UT is based on the time of flight diffraction (hereinafter TOFD) technique. According to the structural and material characteristics of the BMI, many researches have been done on block with simulated defect, and characteristic rule of defect indication signals in different areas are summarized. Then, the optimal design parameters of the TOFD probe are gained and the disadvantages of ultrasonic inspection are overcome. The eddy current inspection system adopts the inspection technology with the Bobbin probe and the rotary point probe combined together. The use of its surface and near the surface of the detection ability has become a powerful complement to ultrasonic testing. From the test result, TOFD probe has high defect height measurement accuracy. Measurement error isn't more than 1mm and mostly is positive deviation. The surface defects with a height of not less than 2 mm can be measured. Considering the complex geometry of BMI, the multi mode multi-axis scanning program and remote automatic docking device are used in the system. The multi-mode multi axis scanning program can be achieved axial and circumferential rotation of the probe with the axial positioning accuracy within 2mm and circumferential positioning accuracy within 3 degrees. The remote automatic docking device can be used to connect the bottom of the mechanical device and the top of the BMI in fast and seamless security to avoid the mechanical device bumping of the component. The probe connecting shaft is made of flexible material, which avoids the violent bumping of the tested parts and greatly enhances the safety of the equipment operation. The system simulates the actual scanning environment by establishing three-dimensional model and testing it on the simulation body.","BMI; TOFD; IN-SERVICE INSPECTION","25th International Conference on Nuclear Engineering, Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA, JUL 02-06, 2017","Ge, L (Corresponding Author), Res Inst Nucl Power Operat, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.

With new types of attacks that appear continuously, the development of flexible and adaptive security is a serious challenge. In this field, approaches of network-based intrusion detection are ideal techniques to protect target systems and networks from destructive actions. Depending on the analytical model, this technique is divided into signature-based and anomaly-based models. Signature-based model focuses on known attacks or their obvious features by matching patterns of behavior with a predefined byte string. The biggest problem with this model is that it is not able to detect new attacks if the software does not have their signatures defined in the database. Anomaly-based model specifies normal behavior of the traffic and computes unusual degree of one packet on base of its deviance measure from normal behavior. Even then if diversion is discovered, the system would generate alarms indicating a series of intrusion events that have occurred. Despite the ability of this system to detect new attacks, it generates a high rate of false alarms. Shimamura and Kono (2006) in order to reduce false alarms rate in the signature-based IDS proposed a system called TrueAlarm. Although this proposed system can be considered as a new system of network-based intrusion detection due to its benefits than basic NIDS, it is important to note that TrueAlarm still cannot identify unknown suspicious messages as the signature-based NIDS, and this is its biggest weakness due to the large volume of network attacks in today's world that include many zero-day attacks. In this article whilst we want to introduce intrusion detection system as a powerful tool in the field of network security, and also a variety of analysis techniques and models, using a basic system namely TrueAlarm, we present a new architecture namely Integrated TrueAlarm to improve the false alarm problem of anomaly-based analysis model.","Network-based intrusion detection system; false alarms; signature-based analysis; anomaly-based analysis; Integrated TrueAlarm","7th International Conference on Information Warfare and Security (ICIW), Univ Washington, Ctr Informat Assurance & Cybersecur, Seattle, WA, MAR 22-23, 2012","Hatamikhah, Saeide; Laali, Mohammad, Tarbiat Moallem Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Tehran, Iran.","English",""

Then we design the prune-merge algorithm to further optimize the structure of the tree and cut down the amount of receivers. The algorithm effectively reduces the computation and storage cost of the trusted authority in the system.

In this notion, an encryptor selects n recipients and a threshold value t for the creation of the ciphertext. The plaintext can only be recovered if at least t receivers cooperate. The key issue in this notion is its dynamicity, where after the users enroll to the system, the sender can dynamically select the set of recipients as well as dynamically set the threshold t upon the creation of the ciphertext. Another essential feature of this notion is the need for a constant-size ciphertext. Interestingly, the work by Delerablee and Pointcheval in Crypto 2008 is the only work that achieves this essential feature. In this work, we propose a new scheme achieving all of these nice properties with significant improvements in terms of the computational efficiency (both the encryption and decryption). In our scheme, there is no need to conduct any encryption and decryption using additional dummy users, which are not part of the recipient group, which is in contrast to Delerablee and Pointcheval's work. This improvement has significantly reduced the amount of computations required in both encryption and decryption algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The key idea is to leverage different measurement matrices for sampling device and cloud. Thus encryption is realized with shuffling enabled compressive sensing.

Based on this parameters it's decided whether the data is suitable for processing by the standard method (fiducial points based audiovisual liveness detection, FALD). If the quality of data is not sufficient, then our system switches to a new algorithm (svm-based audiovisual liveness detection, SALD), which provides less protection quality, but is able to operate when FALD is unsuitable. To improve the quality of the FALD algorithm we have collected the special dataset. This dataset allows to get better reliability of the algorithm for searching of fiducial points on the user's face image.

Unlike the existing similar works, these schemes eliminate the need of storing public key and secret key for transmitting personalized messages. We emphasize that BEPM-III employs multilinear maps and achieves logarithmic size public parameter with increasing computation cost. More positively, BEPM-II achieves adaptive security with the parameter size and computation cost as in the existing BEPM.

The interdependence of these spaces makes that CPSS is more likely to be attacked. The attack consequences may directly affect the state of the physical world and even endanger the people's life. Thus, the most challenging issue for CPSS is to ensure the space security. However, existing security analysis methods focus on the static analysis at the design phase. They do not consider the open and dynamic characteristics which are the core features of CPSS. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security analysis framework for CPSS to prevent the unauthorized flow of information. Firstly, the access control model of CPSS is proposed. It controls the access behaviors by considering the space information covering the social, cyber, and physical spaces. Secondly, Labelled Transition System (LTS) is established to describe the future evolutions of CPSS. The space states in the LTS which violate the security requirements are reasoned by the model checking technology. Thirdly, a policy adjustment method is proposed to prevent the system from entering the violated states or mitigate the bad results caused by the violations. In the end, the effectiveness of our approach is evaluated by a smart building case, and the necessity of our approach is analyzed by the performance evaluation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Such an aspect could represent a serious limiting factor in the search for ever higher power system exploitation levels. Hence, in order to exploit the existing networks as much as possible, ensuring at the same time adequate security levels, the system operators must monitor the electromechanical oscillations continuously, estimating their fundamental parameters (e.g. frequency, damping factor/ratio, amplitude and phase), and determining the actual dynamic stability margins. Nowadays, electromechanical oscillations tracking can be performed in real time thanks to the quick development of wide area measurement/monitoring systems, and the employment of so-called measurement-based methods (a.k.a. mode meters). In this regard, the paper presents a performance comparison among several measurement-based methods currently operating on the Italian Wide Area Monitoring (WAM) platform. The main objective of this investigation is to analyze the behavior of each of them with respect to actual critical/not critical electromechanical oscillations recorded on the European Network Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-e) Continental Synchronous European System (CESA). The considered case studies cover a large variety of situations that can be encountered in the ordinary ENTSO-e CESA operation: local and inter-area oscillations; single mode and multi-mode power signals; ambient and ringdown data; and so on. By keeping in mind that usually no best estimator exists, owing to the lack of an optimality definition, the present analysis aims at examining whether some algorithms are generally more suitable than others, with respect to the variety of aforementioned situations. In detail, the measurement-based methods considered in this work are the Tufts-Kumaresan method, Hankel Singular Value Decomposition-VarPRO, Hilbert-Huang Transform, its refined Empirical Mode Decomposition with Fourier-Based Masking Technique (R-EMD), and a recently published Hilbert Transform-based estimation algorithm. Obviously, this set of estimation techniques cannot be considered exhaustive for the research problem under analysis. Nonetheless, it represents a collection of the major, recent and most fashionable methodologies implemented in actual WAM architectures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

CRYPTO `97) is an intriguing primitive that provides a security guarantee against not only eavesdropping attacks as required by semantic security, but also stronger coercion attacks performed after the fact. The concept of deniability has later demonstrated useful and powerful in many other contexts, such as leakage resilience, adaptive security of protocols, and security against selective opening attacks. Despite its conceptual usefulness, our understanding of how to construct deniable primitives under standard assumptions is restricted. In particular from standard lattice assumptions, i.e. Learning with Errors (LWE), we have only flexibly and non-negligible advantage deniable public-key encryption schemes, whereas with the much stronger assumption of indistinguishable obfuscation, we can obtain at least fully sender-deniable PKE and computation. How to achieve deniability for other more advanced encryption schemes under standard assumptions remains an interesting open question. In this work, we construct a flexibly bi-deniable Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) scheme for all polynomial-size Branching Programs from LWE. Our techniques involve new ways of manipulating Gaussian noise that may be of independent interest, and lead to a significantly sharper analysis of noise growth in Dual Regev type encryption schemes.

Since 1994, a lot of alternatives to BE have moreover been additionally proposed, such as the broadcast and trace (BT) primitive which is a combination of broadcast encryption and traitor tracing. Among the other variants of BE, the notion of augmented BE (AugBE), introduced by Boneh and Waters in 2006, corresponds to a BE scheme with the particularity that the encryption algorithm takes an index as an additional parameter. If an AugBE scheme is both message and index hiding, it has been proved that it can generically be used to construct a secure BT scheme. Hence, any new result related to the former gives an improvement to the latter. In this paper, we first show that both BE and AugBE can be obtained by using an identity-based encryption scheme with wildcard (WIBE). We also introduce the new notion of anonymous AugBE, where the used users set is hidden, and prove that it implies index hiding. We then provide two different WIBE constructions. The first one has constant size ciphertext and used to construct a new constant size ciphertext BE scheme with adaptive CPA security, in the standard model (under the SXDH assumption). The second WIBE provides pattern-hiding, a new definition we introduced, and serves as a basis for the first anonymous AugBE scheme (and subsequently a BT scheme since our scheme is also index hiding by nature) in the literature, with adaptive security in the standard model (under the XDLin assumption).","Broadcast encryption; Augmented broadcast encryption; Broadcast and trace; Identity based encryption with wildcard","21st International Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS), Dubai, U ARAB EMIRATES, NOV 13-16, 2022","Barthoulot, A (Corresponding Author), Orange Innovat, Caen, France.

In this paper a multimodal recognition algorithm using palm print and palm vein images. The palm print image is rich in line features as it consists of wrinkles, ridges and principal lines. On the other hand the palm vein image contains rich texture features in the form of blood vessel patterns also called as vein patterns. A multimodal identification system has been proposed in this paper which uses Contourlet transform to analyze the features present in palm print and palm vein images. The proposed algorithm captures local minutae and a global feature from a palm print and palm vein images and stores them as a compact code. After extraction of the ROI from the source images the (2-D) image spectrum is divided into fine sub-components (called subbands) using iterated directional filter bank structure. The feature matching technique is then performed using Euclidean Distance algorithm.

But the recognition of face can be affected by illumination variation, facial expression and other issues. Therefore, the authentication using only face image might be difficult for the system. To overcome this challenge, biometric authentications have to rely on more than one method. In this paper, we consider audio-video person authentication based on two sources of information. Single modality evidence has limitations in both security and robustness. Therefore, here, audio recognition is added with visual recognition. Facial features, as well as speech is extracted separately from audiovisual data and integrate both the modality for secure user authentication. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is used as the speech feature. Viola-Jones and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm are used for visual feature extraction. After the extraction of audio and visual features, the feature selection method is employed. The two-phase algorithm consisting of statistical analysis, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) is proposed to select significant features from audio-visual data. The Audio and Video processing is done in two separate phases using machine learning algorithms. The results of both the modalities are then combined at the decision level based on majority voting. It has been observed that multiple modalities of both audio-visual information give immensely good results compared to a standalone single modality.","Multi-modal authentication; MFCC; Viola-Jones; SIFT; ANOVA; IFS; SVM","IEEE Region 10 Conference on Technology, Knowledge, and Society (TENCON), Kochi, INDIA, OCT 17-20, 2019","Debnath, S (Corresponding Author), Natl Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Silchar, India.

Recent schemes enable secure searching over an encrypted database stored in a server, but these schemes only focus on hiding the access pattern using ORAM. Although the traditional Oblivious Random Access Machine ( ORAM) can hide the access pattern, which refers to the set of documents that match the client's queries, it also incurs significant communication overhead and cannot hide the search pattern. Existing researches show that the general dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE) scheme is vulnerable to statistical attacks due to the leakage of both search patterns and access patterns. Therefore hiding the access pattern is not enough, it is essential to hide both access patterns and search patterns with high efficiency. To overcome this limitation, a DSSE scheme called obliviously shuffled incidence matrix DSSE (OSM-DSSE) is proposed in this paper to access the encrypted data obliviously without using ORAM. The OSM- DSSE scheme realizes efficient search and update operations based on an incidence matrix. In particular, a shuffling algorithm using Paillier encryption combines the 1- out-of-n obliviously transfer (OT) protocol to hide access pattern and an optimized padding scheme to obfuscate the search pattern with low storage overhead. Besides, Simulation results and security analysis confirm that OSMDSSE scheme achieves high security and efficient searches. Also, this scheme provides adaptive security against malicious attacks by adversaries. Furthermore, OSM-DSSE is capable of searching for a keyword out of 9 x 1010 keyword-file pairs within 2.19 s which is 3-4 x better execution efficiency than the state-of-art solutions.","Dynamic searchable encryption center dot Search pattern center dot Access pattern center dot Paillier encryption center dot Optimised padding","","Liu, H (Corresponding Author), Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Software Engn, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China.

In this paper, we propose two practical and efficient semi-adaptively secure key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) schemes with constant-size ciphertexts. The semi-adaptive security requires that the adversary designates the challenge attribute set after it receives public parameters but before it issues any secret key query, which is stronger than selective security guarantee. Our first construction deals with small universe while the second one supports large universe. Both constructions employ the technique underlying the prime-order instantiation of nested dual system groups, which are based on the d-linear assumption including SXDH and DLIN assumptions. In order to evaluate the performance, we implement our ABE schemes using Python language in Charm. Compared with previous (KP-ABE) schemes with constant-size ciphertexts, our constructions achieve shorter ciphertext and secret key sizes, and require low computation costs, especially under the SXDH assumption.","Verifiable computation; Outsourced computation; Attribute-based encryption; Dual system encryption; Charm","11th ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ASIA CCS), Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA, MAY 30-JUN 03, 2016","Chen, J (Corresponding Author), East China Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Software Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

However, cloud-assisted IoT is also becoming an increasingly attractive target for various cyber-attacks, including the authenticity of outsourcing data, untrustworthiness of third parties, and data security and privacy. As a potential and promising solution to securely outsource data, we present the first construction for an efficient cloud data outsourcing system with simultaneous individual transmission preserving outsider anonymity of the subscribed consumer set. In our system, a data owner generates personalized data for each of the consumers in a group and transmits a common encrypted data for the group in such a way that the subscribed consumer set is completely hidden from the outsiders. Personalized data can be recovered only by an authorized consumer, while the common data can be decrypted by all the authorized consumer in that group. The communication bandwidth is compact in our construction, and the decryption algorithm requires significantly less computation cost. We design our scheme using asymmetric bilinear map over the prime order group to prevent fault attacks on symmetric bilinear map. Our construction is built in identity based setting without any non-standard q -type security assumption and does not use random oracles. Our scheme enjoys adaptive security against an indistinguishable chosen-plaintext attack under the hardness of the standard decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent problem. Furthermore, our design supports an exponential number of consumers as the size of the valid identity set grows exponentially with the security parameter, whereas it is only polynomial in the security parameter for the existing cloud data outsourcing systems. In particular, the implementation and performance analysis explicates the advantages of our design for resource-constrained IoT enabled frameworks.","Internet of Things; Cloud computing; Anonymity and privacy; Remote e-healthcare","","Mandal, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Tokyo, Japan.

But as these devices consist of numerous applications (document creator, pdf viewer, e-banking, Social networking app, etc.), locking of the whole devices prevents the user from using any of the applications. Since the variety of applications provided by the devices have different security needs, we feel it is better to have application level security rather than device level. Here, in this paper, we have proposed a behavioral biometric based user authentication mechanism for application level security. First, we have performed a risk assessment of different applications. Then for complete protection, static multi-modal (keystroke and mouse dynamics) authentication at the start of an interactive session, and a continuous keystroke authentication during this session is performed. An analysis of the proposed authentication mechanism has been conducted on the basis of false acceptance rate (FAR), false rejection rate (FRR) and equal error rate (EER). The static multi-modal authentication achieved a FAR of 0.89%, FRR of 1.2% and EER of 1.04% using J48 classification algorithm.

Traditionally, it is not possible to remove any receiver from the encrypted content without decryption. Recipient revocable broadcast encryption (RRBE) is an useful cryptographic primitive whereby a trusted third party can revoke a set of users from the encrypted content without having the ability to decrypt it. This property is not achievable in traditional broadcast encryption (BE) schemes. However, the currently existing RRBE schemes are secure only in the random oracle model. In this paper, we propose two new constructions for RRBE with constant number of pairing, linear exponentiation operations and analyze their security in the standard model. Our first construction achieves adaptive security in the standard model with constant communication cost as opposed to the existing adaptively secure RRBE schemes all of which use random oracles and have linear communication cost. The storage and computation complexity are linear to the total number of users and the number of subscribed users respectively. Our second construction attains selective security in the standard model with constant size public parameter and secret key. The communication and computation overhead are linear to the number of revoked users. We emphasize that, this scheme is flexible in a sense that constant size public parameter allows to encrypt any number of users in the system.

MBF are expected to be more reliable due to the presence of multiple independent pieces of biometric traits. The aim of these multibiometric systems is to achieve a high reliability to determine or verify person's identity. The motivation for using fuzzy logic is that it offers methods best suited to model the information that is inherently uncertain and ambiguous.

This approach is tested on the fingerprint and face score database of 102 people obtained from NIST BSSR1 database.

One such threatening effect comes from GAMEOVER Zeus Botnet. These Botnets enter inside online networks and affect the Peer client list, through Internet Rely Chat (IRC). IRC includes applications like Tactical chat and On Chat. Zeus botnets gather the secret information of these users, such as bank data and military secrets. Moreover, the architecture is P2P and hence the location of GAMEOVER Zeus Botnet varies from the one to another botnets models. The threat of Zeus botnets loom large as they operate through the processes of identification of users, through which, they establish control over the hosts via P2P server. An intelligent method of identification of Zeus botnets in a distributed computing system using cryptographic schemes to defend against such attacks is the prime issue of research in this paper. An advanced Botnet capturing algorithm, named as modified cryptographic prefix IP anonymize (CPA) algorithm is proposed in this research paper to effectively counter the threats of Zeus bots. Essential features of the proposed CPA algorithm include prefixed IP mapped anonymizing in Internet Rely Chat, inbuilt adaptive security algorithm, which helps in network cleansing. If left unchecked, these Zeus botnets may result in consequent shutdown of the system.

The existing technique uses hand vein and palm vein modalities in building a fuzzy vault for multi-biometric recognition. But, security involved in converting the feature points to vault is not much impressive. In order to build effective security measure in fuzzy vault generation, we have to utilize a method of dual cryptography techniques that make use of AES and DES cryptography. Here, we use two types of algorithm, namely AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard) that all are symmetric cryptographic techniques. Initially, feature points from palm and hand veins are encrypted using AES algorithm. Then, the private key generated by AES algorithm is given to DES algorithm for encryption. Finally, the multi-modal biometric template and the secret key are used to generate the fuzzy vault. For decryption, the public key of DES is used to decrypt the private key of AES algorithm. Then, the encrypted feature points are decrypted by the AES algorithm. The performance is analyzed with the help of evaluation metrics. The results are also compared to our earlier technique and the results shows that the proposed technique has achieved better results having GAR of 90% without noise and with noise.

The main advantage of such systems is their ability to detect multiple features associated with the crowd gathering, as they enable multi-source sensors, multi-modal data, and powerful intelligent and analytical methods. Unlike traditional crowd monitoring systems, which make use of simplex forms of different data types, data and information associated with crowded scenarios can be collected, fused, processed and analyzed in large quantities for accurate global assessment and enhanced decision making processes in an ICMMS. Therefore, data fusion is introduced as an enabler to decrease data quantity, reduce data dimensions, and improve data quality. In this paper, we first survey the literature on data fusion application in crowd monitoring systems as we are developing a state-of-the-art ICMMS with data fusion as a major platform enabler. Next, we discuss some popular data fusion architectures and classifications from different perspectives. Based on this, we propose a multi-sensor, multi-modal, and dimensional ICMMS architecture based on data fusion. Then, we identify the data fusion processes in the ICMMS and classify them into sensor fusion, feature-based data fusion, and decision fusion.

Selecting the order of verifier is a crucial parameter to fix because of its high impact on verification errors. A wrong choice of verifier order might lead to tremendous user inconvenience by denying a large number of genuine users and might cause severe security breach by accepting impostors frequently. Unfortunately, this design issue has been poorly investigated in multi-biometric literature. In this paper, we address this design issue by performing experiments using three different serial fusion based multi-biometric verification schemes. We did our experiments on publicly available NIST multi-modal dataset. We tested 24 orders-all possible orders originated from four individual verifiers-on a four-stage biometric verification system. Our experimental results show that the verifier order ``best-to-worst'', where the best performing individual verifier is placed in the first stage, the next best performing individual verifier is placed in the second stage, and so on, is the top performing order. In addition, we have proposed a modification to the traditional architecture of serial fusion based multi-biometric verification systems.

It is an important issue with a large number of medical images interchanged on the Internet every day. So, it is a challenging task to ensure the integrity of received images as well as authenticity. Digital watermarking techniques have been proposed as valid solution for this problem. Methods: It is worth mentioning that the Region Of Interest (ROI)/Region Of Non Interest (RONI) selection can be seen as a significant limitation from which suffers most of ROI/RONI based watermarking schemes and that in turn affects and limit their applicability in an effective way. Generally, the ROI/RONI is defined by a radiologist or a computer-aided selection tool. And thus, this will not be efficient for an institute or health care system, where one has to process a large number of images. Therefore, developing an automatic ROI/RONI selection is a challenge task. The major aim of this work is to develop an automatic selection algorithm of embedding region based on the so called Partial Differential Equation (PDE) method. Thus avoiding ROI/RONI selection problems including: (1) computational overhead, (2) time consuming, and (3) modality dependent selection. Results: The algorithm is evaluated in terms of imperceptibility, robustness, tamper localization and recovery using MRI, Ultrasound, CT and X-ray grey scale medical images. From experimental results that we have conducted on a database of 100 medical images of four modalities, it can be inferred that our method can achieve high imperceptibility, while showing good robustness against attacks. Furthermore, the experiment results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in detecting and recovering the various types of tampering. The highest PSNR value reached over the 100 images is 94,746 dB, while the lowest PSNR value is 60,1272 dB, which demonstrates the higher imperceptibility nature of the proposed method. Moreover, the Normalized Correlation (NC) between the original watermark and the corresponding extracted watermark for 100 images is computed. We get a NC value greater than or equal to 0.998. This indicates that the extracted watermark is very similar to the original watermark for all modalities. Conclusion: The key features of our proposed method are to (1) increase the robustness of the watermark against attacks; (2) provide more transparency to the embedded watermark. (3) provide more authenticity and integrity protection of the content of medical images. (4) provide minimum ROI/RONI selection complexity.","Watermarking; PDE; ROI; RONI; Authenticity; Integrity","","Aherrahrou, N (Corresponding Author), Univ Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah Fez, Dept Informat, LIIAN, Fes, Morocco.

When sharing data with a large number of entities described with fuzzy identities, the data owners must leverage a suitable encryption scheme to meet the security and efficiency requirements. (hierarchical) Identity-based encryption is a promising candidate to ensure fuzzy-entity data sharing while meeting the security requirement, but encounters the efficiency difficulty in multireceiver settings. We introduce the notion of subtree-based encryption (SBE) to support multireceiver data sharing mechanism in large-scale enterprises. Users in SBE are organized in a tree structure. Superior users can generate the secret keys to their subordinates. Unlike HIBE merely allowing a single decryption path, SBE enables encryption for a subset of users. We define the security notion for SBE, namely Ciphertext Indistinguishability against Adaptively Chosen-Sub-Tree and Chosen-Ciphertext Attack (IND-CST-CCA2). We propose two secure SBE schemes (SBEs). We first propose a basic SBEs against Adaptively Chosen-Sub-Tree and Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-CST-CPA), in which we do not allow the attacker to get decryption results from other users in the security game. We then propose a CCA2-secure SBEs from the basic scheme without requiring any other cryptographic primitives. Our CCA2-secure scheme natively allows public ciphertext validity test, which is a useful property when a CCA2-secure SBEs is used to design advanced protocols and auditing mechanisms for fuzzy-entity data sharing.","Subtree-based broadcast encryption; Fuzzy-entity data sharing; Provable security","","Qin, B (Corresponding Author), Renmin Univ China, Sch Informat, ZhongGuanCun St 59, Beijing, Peoples R China.

The multi-mode, loosely coupled, user-centric nature of modern communications and services, coupled with the diversity of operator business models, ensure that modern end-to-end service provision frequently crosses heterogeneous management and administrative domains. Thus, management approaches that can be applied across organizational boundaries are increasingly important in a wide range of application areas. There are a number of significant, common, complex issues which must be addressed in all technologies and applications that involve federated organizations, yet research has heretofore been mostly confined to particular technical or application areas. The first installment of ManFed.Com addressed this gap by bringing together researchers from a broad array of application and technical areas who shared an interest in cross-domain management. The workshop drew out common themes, problems and issues encountered, and the solutions being designed to deal with the problems of managing information systems that span autonomous domains. More than 30 researchers participated in a lively and interactive day of paper presentation, panels and software demonstrations. The success of the inaugural event was such that the organizing committee is now committed to running further installations-we are in the process of preparing a submission to run a the 2nd ManFed.CoM in conjunction with the IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium (NOMS) 2012 conference. We believe that these workshops will help to provide the basis for a common understanding and common approaches to inter-domain management and governance that synthesizes the insights and best-of-breed solutions being developed in the diverse areas in which these problems are encountered. The technical program of ManFed.CoM 2011 was organized as a single track and was composed of two panels of invited experts, two full paper sessions, one short paper session and a demonstration session in which practical software tools were presented. Of the 16 papers submitted, 6 were selected for presentation as full papers, with a further 3 being presented in condensed form as short papers. All the papers submitted underwent a rigorous review process, receiving between 2 and 5 reviews each, with the accepted full papers receiving a minimum score of 7.5 out of 10 from reviewers. The papers presented constituted a good cross-section of current cross-domain management research work-they covered modeling, semantic interoperability, trust management and security, policy based management, business process orchestration, collaboration and delegation and look at management on a number of different layers-from low level network management, all the way up to high level business-driven management.","Network management; Service management; Policy management; Security management","","Feeney, KC (Corresponding Author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Comp Sci & Stat, KDEG, Dublin, Ireland.

Previously, the only construction [Kowalczyk and Wee, Eurocrypt `19] that simultaneously achieves compactness and adaptive security from static assumptions supports policies represented by Boolean formulae. Our framework enables supporting more expressive policies represented by arithmetic branching programs. Our framework extends to ABE for policies represented by uniform models of computation such as Turing machines. Such policies enjoy the feature of being applicable to attributes of arbitrary lengths. We obtain the first compact adaptively secure ABE for deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata (DFA and NFA) from k-Lin, previously unknown from any static assumptions. Beyond finite automata, we obtain the first ABE for large classes of uniform computation, captured by deterministic and non-deterministic logspace Turing machines (the complexity classes L and NL) based on k-Lin. Our ABE scheme has compact secret keys of size linear in the description size of the Turing machine M. The ciphertext size grows linearly in the input length, but also linearly in the time complexity, and exponentially in the space complexity. Irrespective of compactness, we stress that our scheme is the first that supports large classes of Turing machines based solely on standard assumptions. In comparison, previous ABE for general Turing machines all rely on strong primitives related to indistinguishability obfuscation.","","39th Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques (EUROCRYPT), ELECTR NETWORK, MAY 10-14, 2020","Lin, HJ; Luo, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.

Biometric security becomes a positive solution, adopted for many identification problems in various sectors, including Aviation. As the avionics business keeps growing worldwide, air terminals face the difficulties of increasingly more passenger volumes; with that, travelers' desire for a secure and consistent pass through the airport terminals is just expanding. COVID-19 has managed a hit in all parts of our lives. Maintaining social distance and wearing masks are very important in maintaining a person's health in this pandemic situation. In this scenario, facial recognition for passenger identification is difficult and tends to false acceptance of passengers with identical faces. To address this issue, contactless biometric traits like iris and fingerprints are considered for security growth. The paper deals with the fusion of iris and fingerprint to identify passengers without removing the masks and promotes safe travel. The iris and fingerprint features are extracted using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM) and cross number technique. Maintaining these templates requires more space for storage. To make this simple, Sparse autoencoder, an unsupervised deep learning technique is incorporated on the fused template for attaining the dimensionality reduction. A minimum cost matcher(MCM) is employed to increase the multimodal biometric system's accuracy and performance. Thus, the proposed system honors passenger security builds confidence in air travel, and also strives for economic growth.","","IEEE Aerospace Conference (AeroConf), ELECTR NETWORK, MAR 06-13, 2021","Raiu, V (Corresponding Author), JNTUH CEJ, Dept Comp Sci, Hyderabad 500085, India.

Thus, the development of Chinese transportation cannot neglect the role of Inter-City transportation being the infrastructural framework. Keep abreast of Inter-City passengers' choice behaviors can support the operation of multi-transportation systems. First, to better address the large deviation between the impedance function and the travelers' perceived cost, we construct the generalized cost function with seven terms, which are car time, waiting time, walking time, access/egress times, ticket price, transfer penalty and comfort level respectively, with reliability and security being taken into considerations. Second, pointing at the problem of low accuracy in calculating the sharing rate of various transportation modes under different traffic systems, we proposed a Two-Stage Path-Size Weibit (TS-PSW) model to calculate the sharing rate of multi-mode passenger flow between cities respectively. After that, we decomposed the TS-PSW model into two-layer Path-Size Weibit (PSW) model by the Two-Stage estimation method, and used the maximum likelihood estimation to solve PSW model respectively. Finally, using the intercity transportation networks (Chengdu- Chongqing, Guangzhou-Qingyuan, Beijing-Zhangjiakou) as background, compare six discrete choice models' calculation results. Result shows that the passenger flow sharing rate curve calculated by TS-PSW Model is evidently the closest to the actual transportation modes, the maximum error from Chengdu to Chongqing is 6.60%, the minimum is 3.80%, the maximum error from Beijing to Zhangjiakou is 10.20%, and the minimum is 3.30%. Results verify the effectiveness of the proposed generalized cost function and mode choice model. The upcoming Winter Olympics will be held during the Spring Festival, other events will not be arranged at the same time. Therefore, travel demand will increase significantly. Improving the mode choice model and verifying its effectiveness on multiple intercity networks, especially the Beijing-Zhangjiakou network, can provide theoretical support for mastering passenger travel mode selection during the future Winter Olympics and further improving transportation planning and related deployment.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Many practical memory devices such as solid state drives, hard disks, or file systems are not perfectly erasable because a deletion operation leaves traces of the deleted data in the system. A number of methods for constructing a large erasable memory from a small one, e.g., using encryption, have been proposed. Despite the importance of erasable memory in cryptography, no formal model has been proposed that allows one to formally analyse such memory constructions or cryptographic protocols relying on erasable memory. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we provide a formal model of erasable memory. A memory device allows a user to store, retrieve, and delete data, and it is characterised by a leakage function defining the extent to which erased data is still accessible to an adversary. Second, we investigate how the erasability of such memories can be amplified. We provide a number of constructions of memories with strong erasability guarantees from memories with weaker guarantees. One of these constructions of perfectly erasable memories from imperfectly erasable ones can be considered as the prototypical application of Canetti et al. `s All-or-Nothing Transform (AoNT). Motivated by this construction, we propose some new and better AoNTs that are either perfectly or computationally secure. These AoNTs are of possible independent interest. Third, we show (in the constructive cryptography framework) how the construction of erasable memory and its use in cryptographic protocols (for example to achieve adaptive security) can naturally be composed to obtain provable security of the overall protocol.","Secure memory erasure; Secure deletion; Adaptive corruption; Constructive cryptography; All-or-nothing-transforms (AoNT)","10th International Conference on Security and Cryptography for Networks (SCN), Amalfi, ITALY, AUG 31-SEP 02, 2016","Camenisch, J; Enderlein, RR (Corresponding Author), IBM Res Zurich, Ruschlikon, Switzerland.

Our starting point is the IBBE scheme of Delerablee (Asiacrypt 2007) and the FIBE scheme of Herranz et al. (PKC 2010) proven secure under parameterised assumptions called generalised decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (GDDHE) and augmented multi-sequence of exponents Diffie-Hellman (aMSE-DDH) respectively. The two schemes are described in the prime-order pairing group. We transform the schemes into the setting of (symmetric) composite-order groups and prove security from two static assumptions (subgroup decision). The Deja, Q framework of Chase et al. (Asiacrypt 2016) is known to cover a large class of parameterised assumptions (dubbed fiber assumption), that is, these assumptions, when defined in asymmetric composite order groups, are implied by subgroup decision assumptions in the underlying composite-order groups. We argue that the GDDHE and aMSEDDH assumptions are not covered by the Deja, Q iiber assumption framework. We therefore work out direct security reductions for the two schemes based on subgroup decision assumptions. Furthermore, our proofs involve novel extensions of Deja, Q techniques of Wee (TCC 2016A) and Chase et al. Our constructions have constant-size ciphertexts. The IBBE has constant-size keys as well and guarantees stronger security as compared to Delerablee's IBBE, thus making it the first compact IBBE known to be selectively secure without random oracles under simple assumptions. The fuzzy IBE scheme is the first to simultaneously feature constant-size ciphertexts and security under standard assumptions.","Identity-based broadcast encryption; Fuzzy IBE; Space efficiency; Simple assumptions","11th International Conference on Security and Cryptography for Networks (SCN), Amalfi, ITALY, SEP 05-07, 2018","Gong, JQ; Libert, B (Corresponding Author), Univ Lyon, ENS Lyon, Lab LIP, CNRS,ENSL,INRIA,UCBL, Lyon, France.

In this work, ant colony optimization (ACO) is employed for the selection of key parameters like decision threshold and fusion rule, to ensure the optimal performance in meeting varying security requirements during the deployment of multimodal biometrics systems. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been widely utilized for the optimal selection of these parameters in the earlier attempts in the literature [Veeramachaneni et al., 2005] and [Kumar et al., 2010]. However, in PSO these parameters are computed in continuous domain while they are assumed to be better represented as discrete variables [Kumar et al., 2010]. This paper therefore proposes the use of ACO, in which discrete biometric verification parameters are computed to ensure the optimal performance from the multimodal biometrics system. The proposed ACO based framework is also extended to the pattern classification approach where fuzzy binary decision tree (FBDT) is utilized for two-class biometrics verification. The experimental results are presented on true multimodal systems from various publicly available databases; IITD databases of palmprint and iris, XM2VTS database of speech and faces, and the NIST BSSR1 databases of faces and fingerprint images. Our experimental results presented in this paper suggest that (i) ACO based approach is capable of operating on significantly small error rates in comparison to the widely employed PSO for automated selection of biometrics fusion rules/parameters, (ii) the score-level fusion yields better performance with lower error rate in comparison to the decision level fusion, and finally (iii) the FBDT based classification approach delivers considerably superior performance for the adaptive biometrics verification.

Multimedia collaboration over wireless devices is inhibited by several factors and requires and advanced software architecture to support bandwidth reservation, QoS, reliability, availability and security. The decision based on a single input and a single security agent to serve all the needs of the home users is to be enhanced to facilitate multi-modal inputs with multiple integrated User Agents working to-ether to facilitate the new generation of dynamic wireless users at home. Cumulated with the technology trend of decreasing display sizes and ever-increasing array of features available to the user, it is very difficult to display all the features on the shrinking displays. Display has to be adaptive and context sensitive to adapt to the dynamic needs of the user. In this paper, we present our recent efforts for extending the functionalities of Home Server in order to support wireless multimedia collaboration and multi-modal context-sensitive analysis. We present a enhanced Home Server architecture that facilitates the existing model to be applied to incotporate wireless set-vices and wireless sensor networks for digital home automation.

However, accessing and exploiting cloud-based resources and services is associated with numerous security implications (e.g. authentication and authorization) which represent the major barriers making individuals and organizations hesitant to migrate data or processing to the cloud. Using biometric techniques is increasingly emerging to secure such users' assets. In this paper, we propose a bi-modal continuous authentication approach integrating face and touch biometrics into mobile cloud environments, going beyond traditional one-off authentication. The system reacts to sliding windows of recent user's actions to dynamically update the trust in genuineness for the current user. For each biometric trait, it calculates the similarity scores resulting from the comparison between probes and templates, then they are fused together. If the fusion score is above a given threshold, the system rewards the current user; otherwise, they are penalized. In case the trust in the current user drops below a predefined threshold, the system raises an alarm. Experimental results indicate the advantage offered by our approach on performance of continuous authentication systems, providing a good security-usability tradeoff to mobile cloud environments.","Mobile cloud computing; Mobile biometrics; Biometric access control; Multi-Modal authentication; Continuous authentication","19th International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP), Catania, ITALY, SEP 11-15, 2017","Fenu, G (Corresponding Author), Univ Cagliari, Dept Math & Comp Sci, V Osped 72, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.

In this study, the finger image is characterized by the two dimensional Bloc based Discrete Cosine Transform (2D-BDCT) coefficients. Then, we use the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for modeling the observation vector. In addition, the same finger is transformed by the two dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D-DFT). The response of this transformation is directly used to create another observation vector. Subsequently, the two subsystems are integrated in order to construct an efficient multi-modal identification system based on matching score level fusion.

A trace-and-revoke system is an extension of the traitor tracing system where there is an additional user revocation mechanism that the content distributor can use to disable the decryption capabilities of compromised keys. Trace-and-revoke systems have been extensively studied in the settings of broadcast encryption (BE), identity-based encryption (IBE), and attribute-based encryption (ABE), but not functional encryption (FE). Recently, Do, Phan and Pointcheval (CT-RSA'20) studied traitor tracing for FE and proposed the first traceable inner-product functional encryption (IPFE) scheme. However, their scheme is selectively secure against chosen-plaintext attacks and supports one-target black-box traceability (a weaker notion of black-box traceability). In addition, their scheme does not support public traceability nor user revocation. In this work, we study trace-and-revoke mechanisms for FE and propose the first efficient trace-and-revoke IPFE systems from standard assumptions. Our schemes support public, black-box traceability, and are proven adaptively secure against chosen-plaintext attacks in the standard model. Technically, our construction is generic and relies on a generic transformation from IPFE schemes to trace-and-revoke IPFE systems. For traitor tracing systems, our generic construction also implies the first traceable IPFE schemes that simultaneously support public, black-box traceability, and achieve adaptive security. This provides a significant improvement over the previous traceable IPFE construction by Do, Phan and Pointcheval.","Attribute-based encryption (abe); Trace-and-revoke system; Inner-product functional encryption; Black-box traceability","27th European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS), Tech Univ Denmark, Copenhagen, DENMARK, SEP 26-30, 2022","Wang, HY (Corresponding Author), Peng Cheng Lab, Dept New Networks, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.

For the sake of the security of the outsourced data, these data have to be encrypted prior to outsource to the remote ``honest-but-curious'' servers. So far, the searchable encryption technique based on the secure index becomes a key and lead solution. Unfortunately, there exists no such solution focusing on the synonym search in the symmetric-key setting. In consideration of finiteness of people's memory and lifetime of people's knowledge, we seriously study this issue. In this paper, we design a scheme for the problem of synonym search, and provide the proof of security. Our proposed technique has a number of crucial advantages. We for the first time put forward the problem of the synonym keyword search over remotely encrypted data in the context of cloud computing. In our scheme, we introduce the concepts of synonym function and synonym sets. We firstly implement a formal practical Synonym Symmetric Searchable Encryption Solution (PSSSE). Through rigorous security analysis, we show that our proposed solution is correct and privacy-preserving (non-adaptive security) without the loss of function of the scheme. Besides, the algorithms we present are simple and effective, it almost increases no space and computing overhead of the user. The overhead of communication still remains O(1). The time complexity of searching on encryption data is O(p) (p denotes the maximum number of synonym of keyword). To apply to general situation, we simultaneously give a practical trade-off between availability and performance. This scheme greatly enhances system usability by responding the answers that are all documents containing keyword and corresponding synonyms. Its occurrence obviously overcomes the deficiency of existing schemes. Hence, our solution is very significative to practical use and bridges the gap of state-of-art.","Cloud computing; Synonym search; Searchable encryption","International Conference on Computer Science and Communication Engineering (CSCE), Suzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA, JUN 13-14, 2015","Liu, ZP (Corresponding Author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.

To this aim, we are developing a method based on simulating the fake score distributions of individual matchers, to evaluate the relative robustness of different score fusion rules. We model the score distribution of fake traits by assuming it lies between the one of genuine and impostor scores, and parametrize it by a measure of the relative distance to the latter, named attack strength. Different values of the attack strength account for the many different factors which can affect the distribution of fake scores. In this paper we present preliminary results aimed at evaluating the capability of our model to approximate realistic fake score distributions.

Applications such as personal identification, access control, forensics applications, e-banking, e-government, e-health and recently personalized human-smart-home and human-robot interaction present some examples. In order to offer person-specific services for/of specific person a pre-identifying step should be done in the run-up. Using biometric in such application is encountered by diverse challenges. First, using one trait and excluding the others depends on the application aimed to. Some applications demand directly touch to biometric sensors, while others don't. Second challenge is the reliability of used biometric arrangement. Civilized application demands lower reliability comparing to the forensics ones. And third, for biometric system could only one trait be used (uni-modal systems) or multiple traits (Bi-or Multi-modal systems). The latter is applied, when systems with a relative high reliability are expected. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive view about biometric and its application. The above mentioned challenges will be analyzed deeply. The suitability of each biometric sensor according to the aimed application will be deeply discussed.

They allow to compute joint function over data from multiple parties. Both primitives are aimed at applications in multi-user settings where decryption can be correctly output for users with appropriate functional decryption keys only. While the definitions for a single user or multiple users were quite general and can be realized for general classes of functions as expressive as Turing machines or all circuits, efficient schemes have been proposed so far for concrete classes of functions: either only for access control, i.e. the identity function under some conditions, or linear/quadratic functions under no condition. In this paper, we target classes of functions that explicitly combine some evaluation functions independent of the decrypting user under the condition of some access control. More precisely, we introduce a framework for MCFE with fine-grained access control and propose constructions for both single-client and multi-client settings, for inner-product evaluation and access control via Linear Secret Sharing Schemes (LSSS), with selective and adaptive security. The only known work that combines functional encryption in multi-user setting with access control was proposed by Abdalla et al. (Asiacrypt `20), which relies on a generic transformation from the single-client schemes to obtain MIFE schemes that suffer a quadratic factor of n (where n denotes the number of clients) in the ciphertext size. We follow a different path, via MCFE: we present a duplicate-and-compress technique to transform the single-client scheme and obtain a MCFE with fine-grained access control scheme with only a linear factor of n in the ciphertext size. Our final scheme thus outperforms the Abdalla et al.'s scheme by a factor n, as one can obtain MIFE from MCFE by making all the labels in MCFE a fixed public constant. The concrete constructions are secure under the SXDH assumption, in the random oracle model for the MCFE scheme, but in the standard model for the MIFE improvement.","","28th Annual International Conference on the Theory and Application of Cryptology and Information Security (ASIACRYPT), Taipei, TAIWAN, DEC 05-09, 2022","Nguyen, K (Corresponding Author), PSL Univ, DIENS, Ecole Normale Super, CNRS,Inria, Paris, France.

The traditional geographic information system (GIS) mostly manages time-discretized geospatial data by means of the Structured Query Language (SQL) database management system (DBMS) and emphasizes query and retrieval of massive historical geospatial data on disk. This limits its capability for on-the-fly access of real-time geospatial data for online analysis in real time. This paper proposes a hybrid database organization and management approach with SQL relational databases (RDB) and not only SQL (NoSQL) databases (including the main memory database, MMDB, and distributed files system, DFS). This hybrid approach makes full use of the advantages of NoSQL and SQL DBMS for the real-time access of input data and structured on-the-fly analysis results which can meet the requirements of increased spatio-temporal big data linking analysis. The MMDB facilitates real-time access of the latest input data such as the sensor web and IoT, and supports the real-time query for online geospatial analysis. The RDB stores change information such as multi-modal features and abnormal events extracted from real-time input data. The DFS on disk manages the massive geospatial data, and the extensible storage architecture and distributed scheduling of a NoSQL database satisfy the performance requirements of incremental storage and multi-user concurrent access. A case study of geographic video (GeoVideo) surveillance of public security is presented to prove the feasibility of this hybrid organization and management approach.","real-time geospatial data; NoSQL; RDBMS; data management; public security; hybrid databases; GeoVideo","","Zhu, Q; Zhang, YT (Corresponding Author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.

In the proposed system, face recognition algorithm is designed by PCA and LDA. On the other hand, the signature verification is designed by a novel method based on grid partition, Kernel PCA and LDA. To calculate the similarity between test image and training image, we adopt the selective distance measure determined by various experiments. More specifically, Mahalanobis and Euclidian distance measures are used for face and signature, respectively. As the fusion step, decision rule by weighted sum fusion scheme effectively combines the two matching scores calculated in each biometric system.

In this paper, we propose an efficient online personal identification system based on Multi-Spectral Palmprint (MSP) images using Contourlet Transform (CT) and Gabor Filter (GF) response. In this study, the spectrum image is characterized by the contourlet coefficients sub-bands. Then, we use the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for modeling the observation vector. In addition, the same spectrum is filtered by the Gabor filter. The real and imaginary responses of the filtering image are used to create another observation vector. Subsequently, the two sub-systems are integrated in order to construct an efficient multi-modal identification system based on matching score level fusion. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method, which brings both high identification and accuracy rate.","Biometrics; Identification; Multispectral Palmprint; Contourlet; HMM; Gabor Filter; Data Fusion","11th International Conference on Security and Cryptography (SECRYPT), Vienna, AUSTRIA, AUG 28-30, 2014","Meraoumia, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Ouargla, Fac Nouvelles Technol Informat & Commun, Lab Genie Elect, Ouargla 30000, Algeria.

In the last years, a not negligible part of the scientific community started to apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to image-based representations of the audio stream, due to their successful adoption in almost all the computer vision tasks. In this paper, we carry out a detailed benchmark of various widely used CNN architectures and visual representations on a popular dataset, namely the MIVIA Audio Events database. Our analysis is aimed at understanding how these factors affect the sound event recognition performance with a particular focus on the false positive rate, very relevant in audio surveillance solutions. In fact, although most of the proposed solutions achieve a high recognition rate, the capability of distinguishing the events-of-interest from the background is often not yet sufficient for real systems, and prevent its usage in real applications. Our comprehensive experimental analysis investigates this aspect and allows to identify useful design guidelines for increasing the specificity of sound event recognition systems.","","25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), ELECTR NETWORK, JAN 10-15, 2021","Greco, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Salerno, Dept Informat Engn Elect Engn & Appl Math, Fisciano, Italy.

To this end, information integration from different imaging modalities, such as thermal infrared and visible spectrum, can significantly improve the detection rate in respect to mono-modal strategies. For this reason, an effective fusion scheme is necessary to combine the information presented by multiple sensors. In this paper, we propose a pedestrian classification method based on the multiple kernel learning framework; standard pixel features (such as spatial derivatives) from both imaging modalities are employed to learn several feature-related basic kernels and a compound kernel is found as an optimized linear combination of basic kernels. Finally the compound kernel is used to train an SVM.

Our fusion architecture provides the flexibility to match these trade-offs with mission requirements unlike many conventional systems that require significant modifications for each new mission. We illustrate our data fusion performance with case studies that span many of the potential mission scenarios including border surveillance, base security, and infrastructure protection.

However, the robustness of the recognition process becomes a major problem. When identifying unseen categories with traditional finger-vein recognition systems, a few issues remain, such as recognition interference and low efficiency. This paper proposes a Deep Generalized Label Finger-Vein (DGLFV) model to extract feature maps and achieve high-accuracy recognition. The largest rectangular finger-vein region is extracted through image semantic segmentation and the advanced bidirectional traversing and center diffusion method for the known categories. Then we generalize all the unseen categories actively as Class C + 1 to reduce interference from unregistered users. Furthermore, an adaptive threshold acquisition algorithm is proposed for Label Receiver Operating Characteristic (LROC), so that the procedures of classification, recognition, and verification are unified. Apart from Shandong University Homologous Multi-modal Traits (SDUMLA-HMT), we have conducted additional experiments on our self-built database, Finger Veins of Signal and Information Processing Laboratory (FV-SIPL). The recognition accuracy of the approach proposed in this paper has reached 99.25% and 99.08% testing on FV-SIPL and SDUMLA-HMT, with a low error rate at 1.481% and 2.228% and little time consumption of 0.157s for a single image, which is better than most state-of-the-art finger-vein recognition methods.","DGLFV; finger-vein recognition; generalized category; FV-SIPL; SDUMLA-HMT","","Tao, ZY (Corresponding Author), Liaoning Tech Univ, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Huludao 125105, Peoples R China.

We discuss the detection of life using five distinct properties each from finger, face and eye modalities and present results from a simulation that highlights the improved security based on an impostor's inability to accurately predict the combination of trait liveness properties the system might prompt and test for during capture.","component; Biometric trait; Liveness Detection; Suspicious presentation","19th IEEE UKSim-AMSS International Conference on Mathematical Modelling and Computer Simulation (UKSim), Emmanuel Coll, Cambridge, ENGLAND, APR 05-07, 2017","Okereafor, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Azteca, Dept Informat Syst, Chalco, Mexico.

The ear, which is turning out to be a promising biometric identifier having some desirable properties such as universality, uniqueness, permanence, can also be used along with face for better performance of the system. A multi-modal biometric system combining 2D face, 3D face (depth image) and ear modalities using Microsoft Kinect and Webcam is proposed to address these challenges to some extent. Also avoiding redundancy in the extracted features for better processing speed is another challenge in designing the system. After careful survey of the existing algorithms applied to 2D face, 3D face and ear data, we focus on the well-known PCA (Principal Component Analysis) based Eigen Faces algorithm for ear and face recognition to obtain a better performance with minimal computational requirements. The resulting proposed system turns out insensitive to lighting conditions, pose variations, aging and can completely replace the current recognition systems economically and provide a better security. A total of 109 subjects participated in diversified data acquisition sessions involving multiple poses, illuminations, eyewear and persons from different age groups. The dataset is also a first attempt on the stated combination of biometrics and is a contribution to the field of Biometrics by itself for future experiments. The results are obtained separately against each biometric and final decision is obtained using all the individual results for higher accuracy. The proposed system performed at 98.165 % verification rate which is greater than either of the dual combinations or each of the stated modality in a statistical and significant manner.","Biometrics; Security system; Person identification; Modalities; Kinect; Feature extraction; Ear recognition; Face recognition; PCA (Principal component Analysis); Eigen faces","2nd International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Mining (ICCIDM), Bhubaneswar, INDIA, DEC 05-06, 2015","Boggaram, AS (Corresponding Author), Amrita Univ, Comp Sci & Engn, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.

In a lockable obfuscation scheme there exists an obfuscation algorithm Obf that takes as input a security parameter, a program P, a message msg and ``lock value'' lck and outputs an obfuscated program oP. One can evaluate the obfuscated program oP on any input x where the output of evaluation is the message msg if P(x) = lck and otherwise receives a rejecting symbol. We proceed to provide a construction of lockable obfuscation and prove it secure under the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption. Notably, our proof only requires LWE with polynomial hardness and does not require complexity leveraging. We follow this by describing multiple applications of lockable obfuscation. First, we show how to transform any attributebased encryption (ABE) scheme into one in which the attributes used to encrypt the message are hidden from any user that is not authorized to decrypt the message. (Such a system is also know as predicate encryption with one-sided security.) The only previous construction due to Gorbunov, Vaikuntanathan and Wee is based off of a specific ABE scheme of Boneh et al. By enabling the transformation of any ABE scheme we can inherent different forms and features of the underlying scheme such as: multi-authority, adaptive security from polynomial hardness, regular language policies, etc. We also show applications of lockable obfuscation to separation and uninstantiability results. We first show how to create new separation results in circular encryption that were previously based on indistinguishability obfuscation. This results in new separation results from learning with error including a public key bit encryption scheme that it IND-CPA secure and not circular secure. The tool of lockable obfuscation allows these constructions to be almost immediately realized by translation from previous indistinguishability obfuscation based constructions. In a similar vein we provide random oracle uninstantiability results of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation (and related transformations) from the lockable obfuscation combined with fully homomorphic encryption. Again, we take advantage that previous work used indistinguishability obfuscation that obfuscated programs in a form that could easily be translated to lockable obfuscation.","","58th IEEE Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), Berkeley, CA, OCT 15-17, 2017","Goyal, R (Corresponding Author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Comp Sci, Austin, TX 78712 USA.

The progress seen in technology and security has a vital role to play in Biometric recognition which is a reliable technique to validate individuals and their identity. The biometric identification is generally based on either their physical traits or their behavioural traits. The multimodal biometrics makes use of either two or more of the modalities to improve recognition. There are some popular modalities of biometrics that are palm print, finger vein, iris, face or fingerprint recognition. Another important challenge found with multimodal biometric features is the fusion, which could result in a large set of feature vectors. Most biometric systems currently use a single model for user authentication. In this existing work, a modified method of heuristics that is efficiently used to identify an optimal feature set that is based on a wrapper-based feature selection technique. The proposed method of feature selection uses the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are used to feature extraction and classification process utilizes the integration of face, and finger print texture patterns. The set of training images is converted to grayscale. The crossover operator is applied to generate multiple samples for each number of images. The wok proposed here is pre-planned for each weight of each biometric modality, which ensures that even if a biometric modality does not exist at the time of verification, a person can be certified to provide calculated weights the threshold value.

In order to offer person-specific services for/of specific person a pre-identifying step should be done in the run-up. Using biometric in such application is encountered by diverse challenges. First, using one trait and excluding the others depends on the application aimed to. Some applications demand directly touch to biometric sensors, while others don't. Second challenge is the reliability of used biometric arrangement. Civilized application demands lower reliability comparing to the forensics ones. And third, for biometric system could only one trait be used (uni-modal systems) or multiple traits (Bi-or Multi-modal systems). The latter is applied, when systems with a relative high reliability are expected. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive view about biometric and its application.

Toward this end, this study considers the power loss, Voltage Stability Index (VSI), and number of switching as objective functions which can satisfy both operation and security expectations. The Backward-Forward Sweep (BFS) method known for easy convergence has been employed for power flow calculations.

This paper proposes a framework for integrating biometric key based authentication into an IMS. The generated keys need to be consistent. Consistency of keys is attained if the same key is generated for every instance of biometric input. Generation of long and consistent keys directly from feature sets poses a challenge due to intra and inter user variations inherent to biometric data. A novel methodology for generating consistent keys using principles of vector quantization and cluster based learning is introduced. 15-bit keys have been extracted from handwritten signature datasets.

In this article, we release unmanned aerial vehicles as well as fixed ground devices to achieve multi-level and multi-modal behavioral sensing on a massive crowd, deploy a hybrid model in edge cloud to extract global features from behavioral data of a massive crowd, and then utilize these global features to construct decent classification algorithms for action recognition and behavioral semantic cognition. With the cooperation of behavioral data and cognitive algorithms, we can understand the instantaneous emotions of the crowd. On the basis of behavioral data and the emotional state of the crowd, the correlation between daily behavior and any dangerous intention of a massive crowd has been revealed by utilizing behavioral big data analysis, which is a key foundation for predicting people's dangerous intentions. Finally, we conduct a case study of abnormal behavior detection based on pix2pix and continuous video frames. The experimental results show that the performance of our method is better than other algorithms in both public datasets and the customized Hajj dataset.

The second step is feature extraction, where the Haralick texture and shape methods are used to extract the features of ear images, whereas Tamura texture and color histogram methods are used to extract the features of iris images. The third step is feature fusion, where the extracted features of the ear and iris images are combined into one sequential fused vector. The fourth step is the matching, which is executed using the City Block Dis-tance (CTB) for student identification. The findings of the study indicate that the system's recognition accuracy is 97%, with a 2% False Acceptance Rate (FAR), a 4% False Rejection Rate (FRR), a 94% Correct Recognition Rate (CRR), and a 96% Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR). In addition, the proposed recognition sys-tem achieved higher accuracy than other related systems.","City block distance (CTB); Covid-19; ear biometric; e-exams; feature-level fusion; iris biometric; multimodal biometric; student?s identity","","Shaban, SA (Corresponding Author), Mansoura Univ, Fac Specif Educ, Dept Comp Sci, Mansoura, Egypt.

In this paper, using minutiae and orientation features from two different fingerprints, a new unique mixed fingerprint template is generated. The advantage of creating the mixed template is that it is cancellable and serves as a new virtual identity.

Several studies suggest that complementing visualization with sonification (the presentation of data using sound) can alleviate some of the challenges of visual monitoring (such as the need for constant visual focus). This paper therefore provides an overview of the current state of research regarding auditory-based and multi-modal tools in computer security. Most existing research in this area is geared towards supporting users in real-time network and server monitoring, while there are only few approaches that are designed for retrospective data analysis. There exist several sonification-based tools in a mature state, but their effectiveness has hardly been tested in formal user and usability studies.

This methodology requires that the designed system structure be defined in terms of cooperating agents having well-defined internal components exhibiting specified behaviours. System activities are defined in terms of finite state machines and behaviours parameterised by transition functions. In the investigated case the multi-modal interface is a component of the Operational Centre which is a part of the National Cybersecurity Platform. Embodied agents have been successfully used in the design of robotic systems. However robots operate in physical environments, while cyberspace events visualisation involves cyberspace, thus the applied design methodology required a different definition of the environment. It had to encompass the physical environment in which the operator acts and the computer screen where the results of those actions are presented. Smart human-computer interaction (HCI) is a time-aware, dynamic process in which two parties communicate via different modalities, e.g., voice, gesture, eye movement. The use of computer vision and machine intelligence techniques are essential when the human is carrying an exhausting and concentration demanding activity. The main role of this interface is to support security analysts and operators controlling visualisation of cyberspace events like incidents or cyber attacks especially when manipulating graphical information.

Such a case is encountered within a contemporary airport hall setting: passengers roaming, information systems governing various functions, and data being generated and processed by cameras, phones, sensors, and other Internet of Things technology. This setting has considerable potential of contributing to goals entertained by the CPS operators, such as airlines, airport operators/owners, technicians, users, and more. We model the airport setting as an instance of such a complex, data-intensive CPS where multiple actors and data sources interact, and generalize a methodology to support it and other similar systems. Furthermore, this article instantiates the methodology and pipeline for predictive analytics for passenger flow, as a characteristic manifestation of such systems requiring a tailored approach. Our methodology also draws from DataOps principles, using multi-modal and real-life data to predict the underlying distribution of the passenger flow on a flight-level basis (improving existing day-level predictions), anticipating when and how the passengers enter the airport and move through the check-in and baggage drop-off process. This allows to plan airport resources more efficiently while improving customer experience by avoiding passenger clumping at check-in and security. We demonstrate results obtained over a case from a major international airport in the Netherlands, improving up to 60% upon predictions of daily passenger flow currently in place.","DataOps; cyber-physical systems; Data-intensive systems; systems governance; big data; airport management","","Garriga, M (Corresponding Author), Tilburg Univ, JADS, St Janssingel 92,Room 2-02, NL-5211 DA Den Bosch, Netherlands.

However, it is vulnerable to potential security attacks such as shoulder surfing, camera attack and smudge attack. This study proposes a new kind of authentication system based on a generative deep neural network that can defend any attacks by imposters except a registered user. This network adopts the anomaly detection paradigm where only normal data is used while training the network. For this purpose, we utilize both Generative Adversarial Networks as an anomaly detector and Long Short Term Memory that processes ID time varying signals converted from 2D Android patterns. To handle the stability problem of GANs during the training, Replay Buffer, which has been effectively used in Deep Q-Networks, is also utilized. Evaluation of the proposed method was carried out thoroughly and the accuracy reached to 0.95 in term of the Area Under Curve. Although training this network requires extensive computing resources, it runs on a mobile phone well since the testing version is very light. Further experiments conducted using a group of mobile phone users, including posture variation study, provided comparable performance as well.

It can be remotely operated using an application running on an Android based smart-phone, or a website, or an interactive program running on a laptop. Each can be connected by wires or wirelessly. The prototype spybot also has decision making capability and obstacle-avoidance feature. It is GPS enabled, and can be used as a tracker also. This intelligent spybot can directly fetch the live-video feeds and the spied data to a website, along with GPS coordinates.

While a previous study conducted a partial evaluation of the dataset with data from fourteen users, this paper considers the complete dataset comprising data from 67 users. Another significant difference is in the type of evaluation: instead of using day-based or data-based (number-of-characters) windows for classification, the evaluation employs time-based, overlapping sliding windows. This tests the ability to produce authentication decisions every 10 to 60 seconds, which is highly applicable to real-world active security systems. Sensor evaluation is conducted via cross-validation, measuring the false acceptance and false rejection rates (FAR/FRR).

This paper discusses the potential factors influencing station attractiveness, supported by the related literature on cyclists' and pedestrians' preferences and the characteristics of the stations themselves. The existing literature addresses these topics independently, while this work unites them by proposing a non data-extensive methodology that allows the attractiveness of BSS stations to be assessed. Attractiveness in this context is understood as the set of physical, environmental and service-related features of a bike station that make it more appealing for BSS users than nearby stations. Special attention is paid to differentiating objective features, based on facts, from subjective features, those influenced by personal perceptions. This classification becomes important in this context because subjective aspects can change from one geographical location to another, making the findings related to these aspects difficult to apply to other regions. Moreover, the assessment of the stations' levels of safety and security is included. Thus, the proposed measure of attractiveness of BSS stations provides a balanced overview of several features. The consideration of station attractiveness when designing BSS layouts will help to refine the design of new layouts and will assist in conducting an appropriate diagnostic evaluation of the existing ones. This tool will allow urban and transportation planners to reduce re-balancing costs and to maximise user satisfaction at a low cost, which have a direct impact on improving the urban sustainability. The proposed method is applied to the Dublin bike sharing scheme, Dublinbikes, with good performance results.","bike-sharing; neighbouring bike stations; walkability; bikeability; subjective factors; safety; security; urban sustainability","","Nogal, M (Corresponding Author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn & Geosci, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands.

The biometrics community has achieved impressive progress recently due to the excellent performance of deep neural networks and the availability of large datasets. Although ethnic bias has been verified to severely affect the performance of face recognition systems, it still remains an open research problem in face anti-spoofing. Recently, a multi-ethnic face anti-spoofing dataset, CASIA-SURF cross-ethnicity face anti-spoofing (CeFA), has been released with the goal of measuring the ethnic bias. It is the largest up to date CeFA dataset covering three ethnicities, three modalities, 1607 subjects, 2D plus 3D attack types and the first dataset including explicit ethnic labels among the recently released datasets for face anti-spoofing. We organized the Chalearn Face Anti-spoofing Attack Detection Challenge which consists of single-modal (e.g. RGB) and multi-modal (e.g. RGB, Depth, infrared) tracks around this novel resource to boost research aiming to alleviate the ethnic bias. Both tracks have attracted 340 teams in the development stage, and finally, 11 and eight teams have submitted their codes in the single-modal and multi-modal face anti-spoofing recognition challenges, respectively. All of the results were verified and re-ran by the organizing team, and the results were used for the final ranking.

The biometric recognition systems provide suitable personal recognition approaches for determining individuals. Biometrics are broadly employed in several commercial as well as official identification systems for automatic access control. This paper introduces the model for multi-modal biometric recognition based on the feature level fusion method. The overall procedure of the proposed method involves four steps: pre-processing, feature extraction, recognition feature-level fusion, and Bio-metric recognition. The first step is to input the images into pre-processing steps. Thus, pre-processing three traits, like face, finger knuckle, and the hand vein, is done. Then, the feature extraction is done for each modality to extract the features. After that, the feature level fusion is carried out using Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) and the proposed Taylor-Grey Wolf optimization (Tay-GWO). After feature fusion, the Bio-metric recognition is done based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), which Tay-GWO trains. The proposed Tay-GWO is designed by integrating the Taylor series and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). The analysis shows that the developed model achieves the maximal accuracy of 94.86%, maximal sensitivity of 96.80%, and specificity of 93.74%, respectively.","Multi-modal bio-metric system; Taylor series; Grey wolf optimization; Deep convolutional neural network; Cryptography","","Arora, A (Corresponding Author), Dr CV Raman Inst Sci & Technol, Kargi Rd, Kota 495113, Chhattisgarh, India.

Their presence is now wide spread in sensitive areas such as home automation, industrial control systems, medical devices and security systems. As their popularity has increased, so has the urgency to protect and defend these networks. The decentralized nature of ZigBee ad-hoc networks creates unique security challenges for maintaining network security and intrusion detection. RF-fingerprinting provides a unique physical (PHY) layer defense against node counterfeiting by identifying rogue devices through their RF-emissions. In previous work, feature generation from received RF signals was accomplished with parametric variables such as standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, all based on the assumption of a normal distribution of a particular region of interest. We show in this work that most collected signals are either multi-modal or non-parametric. Use of non-parametric methods for feature generation such as mean, median, mode, and trend represented by linear model coefficient estimates are shown to be much more applicable to the non-parametric distribution of the collected ZigBee preamble, resulting in improved classification performance of devices. Non-parametric classifier Random Forest is used with both parametric and non-parametric features to provide a classification performance comparison. Performance improvements of upto 9% in correct classification rates have been achieved and an effective gain of 4 dB SNR was realized.","","IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications (CISDA), Verona, NY, MAY 26-26, 2015","Patel, H (Corresponding Author), US Air Force Res Lab, Rome, NY 13441 USA.

Probe data from mobile phones provides an important data source for collecting system performance data that can be used as feedback to improve the management of the various transportation and queuing systems used by airport travelers. This paper reports on a study using Bluetooth sensors to quantitatively evaluate the operations of airport security checkpoints. Bluetooth sensors were deployed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport from 30 August to 13 September, 2010 and collected over 100,000 travel time records between data collection stations located along access roads, parking garages, non-sterile areas of terminals, and sterile areas of terminals. In addition, hourly checkpoint passenger volumes were collected. The large volume of this data necessitated the development of statistical characterization procedures and graphics that characterize both the travel time records and checkpoint information. These checkpoint operations reports provide dashboard level reports useful for management to rapidly assess operations, and identify opportunities for improved allocation of staffing. The paper concludes by providing examples of how the checkpoint operations report concept can be extended to characterize the movement of traffic through the airport, the entire passenger arrival experience, and numerically characterize user delay in person-hours.

Unfortunately, due to nonlinearity in distinct and discriminant features of biometric information, accuracy of SVM and ANFIS is reduced. As a result, optimized AI algorithms ((ANFIS) with subtractive clustering (ANFIS-SC) and SVM with error correction output code (SVM-ECOC)) have shown to be effective for biometric information recognition. In this paper, we compare the performance of the ANFIS-SC and SVM-ECOC algorithms in their effectiveness at learning essential characteristics of intrinsic hand features and demographic cues based on Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) feature selection. Furthermore, the accuracy of these algorithms are presented, and their recognition performances are evaluated by root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), scatter index (SI), mean absolute deviation (MAD), coefficient of determination (R-2), Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency index (NSE). Evaluation results show that both SVM-ECOC and ANFIS-SC algorithms are suitable for accurately recognizing soft biometric information on basis of intrinsic hand measurements and demographic cues. Moreover, comparison results demonstrated that ANFIS-SC algorithms can provide better recognition accuracy, with RMSE, AICc, MAPE, R-2 and NSE values of = 0.99 and >= 99, respectively.","ANFIS; artificial intelligence; biometric features recognition; demographic cues; SVM; misclassifications; optimization","","Khunpanuk, C (Corresponding Author), Phetchabun Rajabhat Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Math & Comp Sci Program, Phetchabun 67000, Thailand.

Multi-modal biometrics have been able to improve the accuracy of the system but require additional bandwidth to exchange the data. Fragile watermarking has been used to allow the transmission of both biometric templates using the amount of data required to transmit one of them, that is, the cover image, while securing these templates against attacks. Despite the high accuracy of these systems, communicating such templates imposes risks towards the privacy of the users. In this study, a new method is proposed to generate fixed-size descriptors for the face and fingerprint templates, including the timestamp of the transmission and a unique system identifier. The inclusion of the timestamp enables the system to detect and deny replay attacks, while the unique system identifier maintains the privacy of the users. The experiments conducted to evaluate the proposed method have shown that the proposed method has been able to achieve these features while maintaining high recognition rates, 99.41% and 99.32%, similar to the use of the entire biometric templates in the matching stage.","","","Atilla, DC (Corresponding Author), Altinbas Univ, Sch Engn & Nat Sci, Istanbul, Turkey.

Cryptosystems such as fuzzy extractor and fuzzy commitment require discriminative and informative binary biometric input to offer accurate and secure recognition. In multi-modal biometric recognition, binary features can be produced via fusing the real-valued unimodal features and binarizing the fused features. However, when the extracted features of certain modality are represented in binary and the extraction parameters are not known, real-valued features of other modalities need to be binarized and the feature fusion needs to be carried out at the binary level. In this paper, we propose a binary feature fusion method that extracts a set of fused binary features with high discriminability (small intra-user and large inter-user variations) and entropy (weak dependency among bits and high bit uniformity) from multiple sets of binary unimodal features. Unlike existing fusion methods that mainly focus on discriminability, the proposed method focuses on both feature discriminability and system security: The proposed method 1) extracts a set of weakly dependent feature groups from the multiple unimodal features; and 2) fuses each group to a bit using a mapping that minimizes the intra-user variations and maximizes the inter-user variations and uniformity of the fused bit. Experimental results on three multi-modal databases show that fused binary feature of the proposed method has both higher discriminability and higher entropy compared to the unimodal features and the fused features generated from the state-of-the-art binary fusion approaches.

Many entry-point authentication methods have failed to offer security due to insider or side-channel attacks. This article introduces a sensor-based continuous user authentication approach on the smartphone through multi-modal behavioral biometrics and a machine learning model to tackle the aforementioned issues. The proposed approach captures the touch and motion-based behavioral biometrics through the touchscreen and inertial sensors of the device. Then, the proposed approach extracts several features from captured behavioral data and selects the best set of features through a filter-based feature selection technique. Further, we implement a nonlinear support vector machine with optimized hyperparameters for training and predicting the features to generate the scores. We apply score-level fusion on generated scores of several sensors to compute the final score for identification of the genuine user. In this article, we systematically evaluate the proposed approach with the most commonly used behavioral activities of the smartphone user in our daily life. The experiment results on all behavioral activities show that the proposed approach obtained the best authentication score compared to the other machine learning models, and state-of-the-art methods.

Our objective in this is to identify a distribution that can be used to establish risk metrics. Moreover, our approach provides a visual overview of the time patterns' variation, indicating when attacks are most likely. This will assist decision makers in cyber security to allocate resources or estimate the cost of system monitoring during high risk periods.

Therefore, it is essential to transform the evidences to a normalized form to integrate the results. This paper introduces a novel approach to integrate mutually independent multiple evidences to achieve an improved performance. Typical approach to this problem is to model the statistical characteristics of the evidences by well-known parametric form such as Gaussian. Using Mahalanobis distance is a good example. However, the characteristics of the evidences often do not fit into the parametric models, which results in performance degradation. To overcome this problem, we adopted a discrete PDF that can model the statistical characteristics as it is. To confirm the validity of the proposed method, we used a multi-modal database that consists of 10 registered users and 550 probe data. Each probe data contains face image and voice signal. Face and speaker recognition modules are applied to generate respective evidences. The experiment showed an improvement of 11.27% in accuracy compared to the individual recognizers, which is 2.72% better than the traditional Mahalanobis distance approach.","","16th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, Cheju Isl, SOUTH KOREA, AUG 26-29, 2007","","English",""

Biometric authentication has gained popularity as the system for implicit, non-intrusive and progressive authentication because it has no memory load or carry-along requirements.

However, the extreme sparsity of user-App matrix and many newly emerging Apps create severe challenges, causing CF-based methods to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. Besides, unlike traditional items, Apps have rights to access users' personal resources (e.g., location, message and contact) which may lead to security risk or privacy leak. Thus, users' choosing of Apps are influenced by not only their personal interests but also their privacy preferences. Moreover, user privacy preferences vary with App categories. In light of the above challenges, we propose a mobile sparse additive generative model (Mobi-SAGE) to recommend Apps by considering both user interests and category-aware user privacy preferences in this paper. To overcome the challenges from data sparsity and cold start, Mobi-SAGE exploits both textual and visual content associated with Apps to learn multi-view topics for user interest modeling. We collected a large-scale and real-world dataset from 360 App store - the biggest Android App platform in China, and conducted extensive experiments on it. The experimental results demonstrate that our Mobi-SAGE consistently and significantly outperforms the other existing state-of-the-art methods, which implies the importance of exploiting category aware user privacy preferences and the multi-modal App content data on personalized App recommendation.","Recommender system; Mobile applications; User modeling; Privacy; Sparse additive generative model; Cold start","","Yin, HZ (Corresponding Author), Univ Queensland, Bldg 78,Staff House Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.

Methods based on multi-modal user authentication involving biometrics (i.e. physical and behavioral characteristics of a person) may be employed to cope with this problem. However, dealing with physical characteristics only, these methods are either unable to provide continuous and user-friendly identity verification, or are resource consuming. In this paper, we aim at the provision of continuous, user-friendly and accurate verification of the user identity while preserving scarce resources of a mobile device. Rather than physical, behavioral characteristics are analyzed. The normal behavior of the user is modeled by a set of complementary behavioral aspects that can be used to uniquely identify the user. We develop an approach, where these aspects are separately monitored by dedicated software-based experts. By analyzing the deviations of the current behavior from the modeled one, each expert infers separately its decision about the user identity. The final decision is derived from these multiple expert decisions by applying a decision fusion technique. The monitoring of multiple behavioral aspects helps to improve the authentication accuracy and enables the continuous verification of the user identity. The user-friendliness is supported by the use of transparent authentication methods that do not require direct user participation. Finally, the analysis of behavioral characteristics and the decision fusion process do not involve complicated computational steps and, therefore, are conservative in resource consumption.","mobile device security; authentication; continuous identity verification; user profiling; expert decision fusion","17th World Computer Congress, MONTREAL, CANADA, AUG 25-30, 2002","Mazhelis, O (Corresponding Author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, POB 35, FIN-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.

The problem of high dimensionality of the combined features is overcome by the used of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in the feature extraction phase. One challenge in multi modal feature level fusion is to maintain the balance of the features selected between the two modalities, otherwise one modality may outweigh another. In order to address this issue, we propose to perform feature fusion in the feature selection phase.

FRR refers to the expected probability that two mate samples (samples of the same biometric trait obtained from the same user) will be falsely declared as a non-match whereas FAR is the expected probability that two non-mate samples will be incorrectly recognized as a match. The threshold t defines how much the biometric characteristics must be similar, in order to make a positive comparison, so it measures the correspondence between characteristic to check and template stored in the database.

Multiform authentication bio-tokens have been introduced for continuous entity identification and verification. With the rapid growth and universality of wearable devices, in this article we target continuous authentication for the IoT-based environment with users possessing wearable healthcare (and wellness) related smart objects. To present the state of the art, we provide a comprehensive review of continuous authentication in recent years. Critical characteristics of new biometrics are then introduced. Second, we present a wearable plantar bio-feature extractor constructed via commercial pressure sensors and the Raspberry PI platform. The prototype is adopted to retrieve user plantar bio-data as the raw (and training) data in the proposed authentication system. Third, we apply machine-learning-based techniques to derive a user's plantar bio-features as authentication tokens in the system to support continual (and real-time) entity verification in the background without the user's notice.","","","Yeh, KH (Corresponding Author), Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Informat Management, Hualien, Taiwan.

This paper aims to develop an efficient system for driving stress detection under real driving circumstances. Multiple physiological signals, i.e., electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and respiration (RESP) were collected and multi-modal features were extracted from time, spectral, and wavelet domains. The proposed approaches are motivated by three points: 1) Obvious individual difference affects the transferability of trained models to a new drive. Then, through dissimilarity evaluation and hierarchical clustering, we searched for subgroups of drives that presented relatively consistent feature distributions. Performing cross-drive modeling within each subgroup enables us to identify driver statuses more precisely with less computation cost; 2) fusing the high-dimensional physiological data from multiple views is beneficial to achieve a reliable assessment but brings new challenges for existing techniques. We adopted Multi-view Intact Space Learning (MISL) to integrate rich information from multiple perspectives by constructing a latent intact representation of the data; 3) most of the existing systems are offline. The current study made both offline and online analysis to validate the effectiveness of this research. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approaches can achieve competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods and can be developed into intelligent in-vehicle systems to detect driver's unfavorable statuses, better adjust their negative affection, and avoid traffic accidents.","Stress; Vehicles; Feature extraction; Biomedical monitoring; Physiology; Task analysis; Electrocardiography; Driving stress; hierarchical clustering; multi-view learning; physiological signals","","Chen, LL (Corresponding Author), East China Univ Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Smart Mfg Energy Chem Proc, Shanghai 200237, Peoples R China.

Multimedia has become the biggest of big data as the foundation of today's data-driven discoveries. Almost all disciplines of science and engineering, as well as social sciences, involve multimedia data in some forms, such as recording experiments, driverless cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, smart communities, biomedical instruments, security surveillance. Some recent events demonstrate the power of real-time broadcast of unfolding events on social networks. Multimedia data is not just big in volume, but also multi-modal and mostly unstructured. Storing, indexing, searching, integrating, and recognizing from the vast amounts of data create unprecedented challenges. Even though significant progress has been made processing multimedia data, today's solutions are inadequate in handling data from millions of sources simultaneously. The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Information Processing and Retrieval (IEEE-MIPR) aims to provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation, and applications of multimedia information processing and retrieval for single modality or multiple modalities. The target audiences are university researchers, scientists, industry practitioners, software engineers, and graduate students who want to become acquainted with technologies for big data analytics, machine intelligence, information fusion in multimedia information processing and retrieval. Following a successful debut in Miami, Florida in 2018, the second MIPR, held in San Jose, California, attracted over 140 submissions and more than 100 attendees-a big growth from its inaugural event and an indication of its growing visibility and popularity in the multimedia research society. In addition to four keynote talks, MIPR'19 also featured six innovation multimedia forums organized by both academic and industrial researchers, with topics ranging from computer vision, self-driving, Natural Language Processing, next generation video display, to cutting edge video/audio coding techniques.","","","Su, GM (Corresponding Author), Dolby Labs, Imaging Appl Res, San Francisco, CA 94103 USA.

Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is one of the most interesting subjects in this area. The Re-ID system is divided into two main stages: i) extracting feature representations to construct a person's appearance signature and establishing the correspondence/matching by learning similarity metrics or ranking functions. However, appearance based person Re-ID is a challenging task due to similarity of human's appearance and visual ambiguities across different cameras. This paper provides a representation of the appearance descriptors, called signatures, for multi-shot Re-ID. First, we will present the tracklets, i.e trajectories of persons. Then, we compute the signature and represent it based on the approach of Part Appearance Mixture (PAM). An evaluation of the quality of this signature representation is also described in order to essentially solve the problems of high variance in a person's appearance, occlusions, illumination changes and person's orientation/pose. To deal with variance in a person's appearance, we represent it as a set of multi-modal feature distributions modeled by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Experiments and results on two public datasets and on our own dataset show good performance.","Person Re-Identification (Re-ID); Part Appearance Mixture (PAM); tracklet; signature representation","15th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals and Devices (SSD), Hammamet, TUNISIA, MAR 19-22, 2018","Baabou, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Gabes, Natl Engn Sch Gabes, Gabes, Tunisia.

Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy that effectively induces tunable dynamic phosphorescence color from carbon dots (CDs) on papers via surface ionization engineering for multimode encryption and information storage. Alkali-induced phenolic hydroxyl ionization on CDs can boost intersystem crossing rates, while surface-ionized groups with negative charges significantly passivate the surface defects and reduce non-radiative transitions, which can activate surface state-related blue phosphorescence emission. Combined with the carbon core state-related yellow green phosphorescence, excitation/time-dependent phosphorescence color-changing from yellow-green to blue are realized from alkali (Na2CO3) treated CDs on paper. Furthermore, benefiting from the transition from NaHCO3 to Na2CO3 under thermal treatment, dynamic color-changing phosphorescence can also be activated by thermally stimulating NaHCO3-treated CDs on paper. Finally, multi-stimuli (alkali or thermal) and multi-modal dynamic phosphorescent colors from a single CDs system are realized for the first time. Based on these unique features, multimode encryption and smart 3D codes with anti counterfeiting and monitoring functions for medicine during transport or storage are demonstrated by combining an inkjet printing technique using CD inks.

More often than not the searchers are being asked to obtain an image of the gamma sources that are shielded or otherwise inaccessible. They are constantly being tasked to localize a moving source in busy traffic. Commercially available gamma detection units and prototype Government-funded research products use complex techniques such as hybrid imaging processes (combination of traditional Compton imaging with coded aperture masks, for example, modified uniformly redundant array [MURA] patterns). Standalone radiation detection systems are increasingly capitalizing on multi-modal detection, emphasizing on data fusion, informatics, and novel signal/signature exploitations. At the request of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office, previously known as the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), a study committee from the American Physical Society has recommended that emphasis is kept on the ability to detect shielded special nuclear material with high sensitivity and reliability. Development of new and improved detection algorithms ( e.g., principal component analysis, maximum-likelihood estimation algorithm, and others) has been encouraged. CWMD has been urged to focus on signature identification in its nuclear forensic portfolio. Newer materials like SrI3:Eu2+, LaBr3:Ce, CeBr3:Ca2+ with fast rise time and short decay time of gamma pulses, high intrinsic gamma sensitivity, high gamma energy resolution, and high-efficiency conversion of excitation energy to fluorescent radiation are constantly being sought to build gamma detectors. Neutron detection and associated activation analysis using a gamma ray detection system is highly encouraged. There is a constant demand for miniaturization of gamma radiation detection system for tactical usage in the field- the most sought-after device must be lightweight, easy to use, should be able to withstand harsh environmental conditions, long shelf life with commensurate long battery life, high sensitivity (with preferably high resolution), capable of creating flexible and configurable alarm conditions with directional sensitivity. This array of technical constraints demands stringent specifications on the readout electronics, data acquisition technologies, interoperability and interconnectivity of data output and strict quality assurance of the detection and measurement devices. In recent years the CWMD has developed a system called Intelligent Radiation Sensing System (IRSS) that harnesses the information gathered by ubiquitous radiation monitoring systems deployed by the state, local, and tribal law enforcement organizers [1]. The IRSS was created to better equip law enforcement entities to protect large cities from the threats and harmful effects of nuclear or radiological incidents and emergencies. The IRSS uses a breakthrough technology that networks a group of portable radiation detectors with improved detection, localization, and identification of potential radiological threat. The program created a robust, flexible network architecture along with advanced data fusion algorithms that combine information from many detectors. A study [2] published in the Journal of Materials Research summarized the basic requirements for materials to be used in development of scalable radiation detection systems that considered the critical material performance metrics of energy resolution (1% for semiconductors like CZT, <3% for scintillators like LaBr3:Ce at 662 keV primary gamma ray energy from Cs-137 isotope), fast timing including high mobility of electrons and holes in the semiconductors and fast scintillation processes, high spatial resolution for imaging purposes, high intrinsic detection efficiency (requiring high density, high effective atomic number Z(eff)), high geometric efficiency achieved sometimes by occlusion processes, neutron detection efficiency and operational factors like cost, ease of use, use of peripheral equipment like thermomechanical engines to stabilize the detection systems. Exciting new research and development work utilizing effective data mining algorithms is being performed at universities, national laboratories, and commercial institutions in gamma ray detection technology. For example, gamma ray imaging techniques first used in space telescopes are being applied in modern security and health systems in a joint project between the University of Southampton and industrial partner Symetrica. The project aims to develop a new coded aperture imaging system that could inspire a new generation of ``stand-off'' imaging systems. These systems would allow for remote inspection for radioactive materials. This review article intends to capture the synergy of international commercial collaborations exemplified by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA's) SIGMA program in which detector expertise originating from the United Kingdom (Kromek Group plc.) algorithm development and system modelling and analysis developed by United States national laboratories came together under the general guidance provided by a small commercial unit, Invincea Labs, in the area of network algorithm integration and development.","Gamma detection system; Compton imaging; scintillator; semiconductor; energy resolution; contextual sensing","Conference on Hard X-Ray, Gamma-Ray, and Neutron Detector Physics XXII, ELECTR NETWORK, AUG 24-SEP 04, 2020","Mukhopadhyay, S (Corresponding Author), Nevada Natl Secur Site, Remote Sensing Lab Andrews AFB, Andrews AFB, MD 20762 USA.

The performance of FR systems has improved by orders of magnitude over the past decade. This is mainly due to the latest developments in computer vision and deep convolutional neural networks, and the availability of large training datasets. At the same time, these systems have been subject to various types of attacks. Presentation attacks are common, simple, and easy to implement. These simply involve presenting a video, photo, or mask to the camera or digital sensor and have proven capable of fooling FR systems and providing access to unauthorised users. Presentation attack detection is increasingly attracting more attention in the research community. A wide range of methods has already been developed to address this challenge. Deep learning-based methods in particular have shown very promising results. However, existing literature suggests that even with state-of-the-art methods, performance drops significantly in cross-dataset evaluation. We present a thorough, comprehensive, and technical review of existing literature on this timely and challenging problem. We first introduce and discuss the presentation attack problem and cover related and recent work in this area. In-depth technical details of existing presentation attack detection methods are then presented and critically discussed and evaluated, followed by a comprehensive discussion and evaluation of existing public datasets and commonly used evaluation metrics. Our review shows clearly that despite the recent and significant advances in this area of research, detecting unseen attacks is still considered a key problem. Machine learning methods tend to perform well, but only when test data comes from the same distribution as the training data (i.e. same dataset). New research directions are discussed in detail, including ways to improve the generalisation of machine learning methods, and move towards creating more stable presentation attack detection techniques that generalise across a wide range of unseen samples.","Face Recognition; Presentation attacks; Deep learning; Generalisation","","Abdullakutty, F (Corresponding Author), Robert Gordon Univ, Sch Comp, Aberdeen, Scotland.

Several energy consumption datasets were henceforth published, with each dataset varying in properties, uses and limitations. For instance, building energy consumption patterns are sourced from several sources, including ambient conditions, user occupancy, weather conditions and consumer preferences. Thus, a proper understanding of the available datasets will result in a strong basis for improving energy efficiency. Starting from the necessity of a comprehensive review of existing databases, this work is proposed to survey, study and visualize the numerical and methodological nature of building energy consumption datasets. A total of thirty-one databases are examined and compared in terms of several features, such as the geographical location, period of collection, number of monitored households, sampling rate of collected data, number of sub-metered appliances, extracted features and release date. Furthermore, data collection platforms and related modules for data transmission, data storage and privacy concerns used in different datasets are also analyzed and compared. Based on the analytical study, a novel dataset has been presented, namely Qatar university dataset, which is an annotated power consumption anomaly detection dataset. The latter will be very useful for testing and training anomaly detection algorithms, and hence reducing wasted energy. Moving forward, a set of recommendations is derived to improve datasets collection, such as the adoption of multi-modal data collection, smart Internet of things data collection, low-cost hardware platforms and privacy and security mechanisms. In addition, future directions to improve datasets exploitation and utilization are identified, including the use of novel machine learning solutions, innovative visualization tools and explainable mobile recommender systems. Accordingly, a novel visualization strategy based on using power consumption micro-moments has been presented along with an example of deploying machine learning algorithms to classify the micro-moment classes and identify anomalous power usage.

Hence, the biometric templates cannot be stored in plain format and needs strong protection against any forgery.

Here, initially the input images are pre-processed using various processes to make images fit for further processing. In our proposed method, the features are extracted from the processed hand and palm vein images by finding out unique common points. The chaff points are added to the already extracted points to obtain the combined feature vector. The secret key points which are generated based on the user key input (by using proposed method) are added to the combined feature vector to have the fuzzy vault.

Finally, the experimentation is conducted using the palm vein and hand vein database. The evaluation metrics employed are FMR (False Match Ratio) and GMR (Genuine Match Ratio).

Although much research has focused on speech and keystroke characteristics, no study has examined the potential of indirect cursor control devices, such as mouse or pen, as a means of personal user verification. This paper presents the result of an exploratory examination of the measurement of individual users' behaviour elicited while using two indirect input devices (puck and pen). Ten subjects undertook two series of 500 trials using the puck and pen in a counterbalanced design. Each trial involved guiding the cursor to one of ten possible targets, projected upon one of five angles of projection and one of two distances. Data recorded comprised a series of (x,y) coordinates and associated time stamps of each component of the movement. Five parameters for each full movement were extracted--total time to reach the target, maximum velocity of the movement, maximum acceleration for the movement, time to maximum velocity of movement, time to maximum acceleration of the movement. Results of a series of Multivariate Analyses of Variance indicated that for both the puck and the pen data, there were statistically significant differences between subjects for each of the five parameters. This set of discriminating parameters was then embedded in a verification paradigm. Results indicated that the average error rates varied between 39% (S.D. = 2%) and 14% (S.D. = 2%) for the puck and 38% (S.D. = 2%) and 12% (S.D. = 2%) for the pen. Error rates were dependent upon the number of samples used when making the verification decision. This research suggests that pointing device measurements using the current parameters are not a viable method of user verification by themselves. However, with average error rates as low as 12%, it may be reasonable to integrate them into a multi-modal security system. Practical implications and future research directions are discussed.

This is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation (GA). Robust and resilient detection, identification, localization, and tracking of sUAS sharing UAM airspace is complicated by urban factors such as non-transmitting, non-cooperative drones. Exacerbating these challenges, current technological limitations and vulnerabilities in Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can pose safety and security threats. To streamline a vision of safe and secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace, we propose Drone Net, a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) network of multi-modal ground and flight instruments. Drone Net is an architecture fusing a network of passive visual and acoustic sensor nodes with active Radio Detection and Ranging (radar) and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensing methods for UTM, designed for integration with existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and future UAM systems. The purpose of the Drone Net system is to evaluate use of Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic arrays networked within an urban UAS operating region such as uncontrolled Class-G and waivergranted Class-D airspace. The Drone Net approach combines detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADSB, and EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe, fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network. Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS that are both compliant and noncompliant alongside GA and UAM more safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more advanced scenarios between multiple UAS. The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time for analysis and security applications.

In this paper, we study the application of sensor networks to the intrusion detection problem and the related problems of classifying and tracking targets. Our approach is based on a dense, distributed, wireless network of multi-modal resource-poor sensors combined into loosely coherent sensor arrays that perform in situ detection, estimation, compression, and exfiltration. We ground our study in the context of a security scenario called ``A Line in the Sand'' and accordingly define the target, system, environment, and fault models. Based on the performance requirements of the scenario and the sensing, communication, energy, and computation ability of the sensor network, we explore the design space of sensors, signal processing algorithms, communications, networking, and middleware services. We introduce the influence field, which can be estimated from a network of binary sensors, as the basis for a novel classifier. A contribution of our work is that we do not assume a reliable network; on the contrary, we quantitatively analyze the effects of network unreliability on application performance. Our work includes multiple experimental deployments of over 90 sensor nodes at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, FL, as well as other field experiments of comparable scale. Based on these experiences, we identify a set of key lessons and articulate a few of the challenges facing extreme scaling to tens or hundreds of thousands of sensor nodes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Since each person has a different structure and shape, it is highly secure and more convenient than the existing security system. Among various biometric authentication methods, finger-vein recognition has advantages in that it is difficult to forge because a finger-vein exists inside one's finger and high user convenience because it uses a non-invasive device. However, motion and optical blur may occur for some reasons such as finger movement and camera defocusing during finger-vein recognition, and such blurring occurrences may increase finger-vein recognition error. However, there has been no research on finger-vein recognition considering both motion and optical blur. Therefore, in this study, we propose a new method for increasing finger-vein recognition accuracy based on a network for the restoration of motion and optical blurring in a finger-vein image (RMOBF-Net). Our proposed network continuously maintains features that can be utilized during motion and optical blur restoration by actively using residual blocks and feature concatenation. Also, the architecture RMOBF-Net is optimized to the finger-vein image domain. Experimental results are based on two open datasets, the Shandong University homologous multi-modal traits finger-vein database and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University finger-image database version 1, from which equal error rates of finger-vein recognition accuracy of 4.290-5.779% and 2.465-6.663% were obtained, respectively.

The rising agricultural water demand potentially leads to a conflict with water use among urban, industrial and agricultural sectors. It also threatens food security, human life and the environment worldwide. The urgent need for alternative water resources motivates the exploration of atmospheric water as an abundant and untapped source of freshwater for irrigated agriculture. Herein, kelp-derived hydrogel beads with self-contained properties (i.e., hygroscopic, photothermal, temperature-responsive and durable) are developed via shape-controlled and mass fabrication. The hygroscopic beads attain maximum water uptake of over 5.0 g g(-1) under 90% relative humidity (RH). Synergistic photothermal heating and temperature-driven phase transition afford multi-modal water desorption and efficient water release. Over 95% of absorbed water can be rapidly released under a broad solar intensity of 0.6-1 sun and temperature range of 40-60 degrees C. A solar-powered and sorption-based seed propagator is developed and demonstrated to sustain the plant germination and growth, taking the advantages of the hydrogel beads' reversible moisture sorption/desorption in night/day cycles, the high quality of irrigation water, net-zero energy consumption and thermal management in a system-level design. This work provides a perspective on controlled and mass fabrication of hygroscopic hydrogels. It highlights the solar-powered atmospheric water irrigation for electricity-free and sustainable agriculture regardless of varied geographical and hydrologic conditions.","","","Xu, XF (Corresponding Author), Ocean Univ China, Coll Mat Sci & Engn, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.

Recently, In-band Network Telemetry (INT) has presented its unique capabilities in acquiring the insights of a network and thus has been adopted in many production networks. However, less attention was put on the potential threats on INT (e.g., the man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojan horse injection) that may falsify network measurements resulting in catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose a secure INT architecture called SINT that can effectively mitigate INT vulnerabilities and can be implemented using `chiplet' based multi-modal network processors (MNP). SINT adopts blockchain technology into INT, in which a network status snapshot acquired via INT is viewed as a block and added into a network telemetry blockchain to prevent arbitrary access and malicious modification. To minimize the intrusiveness of the INT and blockchain operations, SINT is designed to be a lightweight protocol and uses improved RAFT consensus mechanisms to reduce its network and computing overhead. The design of the chiplet MNP system makes SINT highly flexible and adaptive to facilitate INT convergence and related blockchain updates. In the SINT architecture, INT tasks and blockchain operations are dispatched to different chips to achieve an optimal trade-off among measurement accuracy, security requirements, and computing resource on the data plane. Experiments and simulations show that SINT can alleviate most cyberattacks on INT and retain 97% of bandwidth utilization for other users' normal traffic in a complex scenario with 500 nodes. Furthermore, SINT converges the INT results quickly and accurately with minor overhead compared to that of the state-of-art INT methods.","Blockchains; Telemetry; Computer architecture; Security; Current measurement; Control systems; Task analysis; INT; blockchain; multi-modal network processor; security","","Cheng, G (Corresponding Author), Southeast Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Engn, Purple Mt Labs, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R China.

The communications infrastructure helps control and manage the unreliable power outputs that most standard power generation elements of the MG (e.g., wind turbines and photo-voltaic panels) deliver. Although communication technologies do offer certain advantages for sensing and control, they generate other complications due to packet loss and packet latency, among other transmission impairments. In this work, we discuss the impact of communications on MG performance, establishing the requirements of data exchanges and system response in the three levels of a hierarchical control approach: primary, secondary, and tertiary. With a focus on the secondary level - responsible for ensuring the restoration of electrical parameters - we identify standards, networking protocols, and communication technologies relevant for the interoperability of MGs and clusters of MGs, including both modes of operation: isolated and grid-connected. We review theoretical approaches and practical implementations that consider the effects of the communications network on the general performance of the MG. Moreover, we undertake an experimental analysis of the influence of wired and wireless communication networks on MG performance, revealing the importance of designing future smart control solutions more robust to communication degradation, especially if wireless technologies are integrated to provide scalable deployments. Aspects such as resilience, security, and interoperability are also shown to require continuing efforts in research and practical applications.","Frequency control; Voltage control; Communication networks; Smart grids; Microgrids; Wireless communication; Power system stability; Communication network; latency; MG secondary control; microgrid; smart grid","","Cespedes, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Chile, Dept Elect Engn, Santiago 8370451, Chile.

Then, it was relatively simple to identify our intelligence collection targets. It was sometimes hard to collect the intelligence, but the targets were clear. Today we live in a world of asymmetries. The most serious asymmetric threat facing the United States today is terrorism; a threat characterized by collections of loosely organized people who operate in shadowy networks that are difficult to identify and define and whose goal is the destruction of our way of life. The intelligence collection targets are thousands of people whose identities and whereabouts we do not always know. If we are to preserve our national security, we must figure out a way of combating this threat. The solution is largely associated with information technology. We must become much more efficient and clever in the ways we use existing sources of data to find new sources of data, mine it for new information, generate context relevant information, make it widely available for collaborative analysis, convert it to knowledge and create actionable options for senior decision-makers. Also. we need a more systemic approach to the problem. A variety of tools, processes and procedures will be required to deal with this problem, however, to be effective, they must be integrated and harmonized within a system context built around a common architecture. In this paper, we will provide a broad overview of the Total Information Awareness (TIA) program - a new counter terrorism initiative sponsored by the Information Awareness Office (IAO) at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The TIA program will develop and integrate a variety of information technologies enabling early warning and understanding of terrorist activities and ultimately the preemption of terrorist attacks through collaborative decision making at the national security level. Examples of some of the key technologies needed for TIA include: entity and event detection and extraction, link discovery and pattern learning across space and time, human language exploitation including summarization and translation, biometrics and multi-modal techniques for human identification, various methods for privacy protection and policy formulation, and several prediction and estimation approaches to understand individual and group behavior and intent. TIA will also require concepts and methods for bringing users with diverse points of view together in a collaborative problem-solving environment, where they can have access to their relevant data sources, the use of discovery tools and the ability to exploit and quickly generate models for structured arguments that facilitate the presentation and vetting of competing hypotheses.","","IEEE Aerospace Conference, BIG SKY, MT, MAR 08-15, 2003","","English","IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS"

Originally created in 1967 as Aerial Measurement Operations, the Aerial Measuring System ( AMS) mission has expanded to include acquiring baseline measurements, performing periodic site monitoring, and responding to radiological emergencies. In an accident scenario, AMS fixedwing and/or rotary-wing systems can be deployed to map radiological deposition. The aircraft are equipped to detect and measure radioactive contamination on the ground. The AMS has a sophisticated radiation detection system to gather radiological information and store it on the cloud using the Advanced Visualization and Integration of Data (AVID) platform or on local computers. This large amount of radiation monitoring data is later used to define and implement public protective guidance. Aerial radiation measurements have proven to be very effective in support of responses to nuclear or radiological emergencies resulting in the dispersal of radioactive material over a large area [viz. Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear power plant measurements done through March and April 2011] [1]. Right after the Fukushima accident, US aerial missions flew 85 flights over 500 hours, covering more than 10,000 square kilometres from the power plant to an 80 km radius to create a common operating picture of the extent of the gamma-emitting radionuclides and the footprint of the deposition from multiple releases. In order to be effective, the aerial measurements must be performed with a system that will collect the data in sufficient detail and quality to support the needs of emergency responders. This paper briefly outlines the technical specifications and functions of a system to be used on an aerial platform (airplane or helicopter) to measure widespread radioactive material (radioactive contamination). The information contained within this paper is intended to help ensure that measurements conducted by multiple AMSs are both technically compatible and comparable with each other and with measurements taken on the ground. Recently AMS has acquired newer and faster aircraft with longer-than-before ranges to deploy radiation monitoring equipment. This article defines and provides guidance for using the US DOE/NNSA's new aerial measurement platforms with multi-fold return of the investment in mind. The guidance involves technical innovation and optimized use of the platforms and collaboration with other stakeholders like the Department of Homeland Security, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The guidance recommends AMS to reposition itself as a valid and credentialed data provider to other relevant and recognized stakeholders in the area of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives threats. It recommends critical application expansion for AVID to analyse multi-modal data including hyperspectral, infrared, and radiological data through data fusion.","Aerial Measuring System (AMS); Advanced Visualization and Integration of Data (AVID); multispectral imagery; hyperspectral imagery; data fusion; unmanned aerial system (UAS); optical remote sensing (ORS); light detection and ranging system (LIDAR)","Conference on Hard X-Ray, Gamma-Ray, and Neutron Detector Physics XXII, ELECTR NETWORK, AUG 24-SEP 04, 2020","Mukhopadhyay, S (Corresponding Author), Remote Sensing Lab, Joint Base Andrews, MD 20762 USA.
