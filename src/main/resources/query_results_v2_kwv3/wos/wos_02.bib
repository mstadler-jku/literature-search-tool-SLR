Abstract = {Security-centric components and systems, such as System-on-Chip
   early-boot communication protocols and ultra-specific lightweight
   devices, require a departure from minimalist design constructs. The need
   for built-in protection mechanisms, at all levels of design, is
   paramount to providing cost-effective, efficient, secure systems. In
   this work, Securely derived Finite State Machines (S{*}FSM) and
   power-aware S{*}FSM are proposed and studied. Overall results show that
   to provide an S{*}FSM, the typical FSM requires a 50\% increase in the
   number of states and a 57\% increase in the number of product terms
   needed to define the state transitions. These increases translate to a
   minimum encoding space increase of 70\%, raising the average encoding
   length from 4.8 bits to 7.9 bits. When factoring in relaxed structural
   constraints for power and space mitigation, the respective increases of
   53 and 67\% raise the average number of bits needed to 7.3 and 7.9.
   Regarding power savings, current minimisation is possible for both FSMs
   and S{*}FSMs through the addition of encoding constraints with average
   current reductions of 30 and 70\%, respectively. Overall, a
   power-constrained S{*}FSM consumes about 5\% more power than insecure
   FSMs with binary encodings, though with a penalty of a 95\% increase in
   layout area.},

Title = {Enhanced Dynamic Stability Control for Low-Inertia Hybrid AC/DC
   Microgrid With Distributed Energy Storage Systems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {91234-91242},
Abstract = {Hybrid ac/dc microgrids (MGs) integrated with traditional diesel
   generators, distributed energy storage systems (ESSs), and high
   penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs)-based distributed
   generators (DGs) have become an attractive power supply solution for
   isolated remote areas and islands, which can effectively reduce
   environmental protection pressure and improve power supply reliability.
   However, in such inherent low-inertia systems, randomness and
   fluctuation of the output power of RESs and uncertain load consumption
   can easily incur dynamic stability issues, such as transient power
   impact, unacceptable frequency deviations, and operation mode
   transitions for security. To solve the above problems and enhance the
   dynamic stability of the system, an enhanced dynamic stability control
   (EDSC) scheme with locally measured signals only is proposed in this
   paper. In this control scheme, the bi-directional interlinking dc-ac
   converter uses the ac frequency in ac MG as the reference value of dc
   voltage and adopts the current feedforward control to control the dc
   voltage in the dc MG to be consistent with the ac frequency. By
   electrically coupling dc voltage and ac frequency, power disturbances in
   ac or dc sides will cause almost identical variation degrees in both ac
   frequency and dc voltage. Under the proposed EDSC scheme, the
   distributed ESSs in both ac and dc sides are then automatically
   coordinated and controlled by the unified droop control to balance
   transient power disturbances and smooth output of diesel generator under
   normal condition, which can effectively improve stability and
   controllability of such low-inertia systems. Furthermore, in an
   emergency such as failure of diesel generator, the operation mode can be
   switched seamlessly with the proposed EDSC scheme. The detailed
   theoretical analysis including control system design, small signal model
   analysis of key parameter influence on system dynamics, and simulation
   verifications in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment is presented to verify the
   effectiveness and practicality of the proposed EDSC scheme.},

Title = {A data-driven approach to anomaly detection and vulnerability dynamic
   analysis for large-scale integrated energy systems},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {234},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {In an integrated energy system (IES), the operating state of each energy
   subsystem changes relatively frequently, which can seriously threaten
   the security of IES operation. A systematic data-driven approach is
   proposed for detecting anomalies and analyzing the dynamics of IES
   vulnerability. Firstly, an anomaly detection method is introduced to
   determine whether there are anomalies in the system operation. The
   method can be set up even if the data labels for discriminating the
   anomalies are unknown, often the cause in practice. Secondly, a method
   of complex network phase theory is proposed to model information
   propagation among IES nodes representative of the IES physical entities.
   Complex network models can then be constructed to describe the system
   behavior in different operating conditions and over different time
   horizons. The degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness
   centrality are used as indications to analyze changes in IES
   vulnerability. Finally, a method is proposed to identify the critical
   points of the IES from the point of view of its vulnerability. The new
   approach is applied to analyze the vulnerability of an IES in Spain. The
   results show that the proposed methods allow revealing system anomalies,
   vulnerability and weaknesses. Outcomes from an analysis by these methods
   can be used by managers to take defensive measures in advance for
   preventing and mitigating the impact of potential factors and threats on
   the IES.},

Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) is a key enabling technology to realize cyber-physical
   system (CPS), which can truly perceive, map, and predict the operating
   state of physical entity. Through analyzing the generality of the
   testing process of large and complex equipment components (LCEC), a
   five-dimensional framework of DT-based test process management (DTTPM)
   is proposed, which comprises physical layer, network layer, data layer,
   model layer, and service layer. In order to realize the visualization
   and enhance the controllability, security, and information transparency
   of LCEC in the testing process, three key technologies are elaborated in
   detail as follows: (1) the construction of the twin semantic model of
   the testing process in model layer, (2) the synchronization method of
   twin model and physical entity based on real-time data, (3) and
   human-computer interaction-based visual monitoring of authenticity and
   safety coordination. Through the case of the vibration test for the
   crowned blade of a steam turbine by blade tip-timing measurement, the
   feasibility and flexibility of DTTPM are demonstrated.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose Time Bounded Anti-Spoofing (TBAS), a novel
   spoof detection method for W-Fi networks. TBAS is based on the simple
   idea of comparing the channel states embedded in packets received within
   a short interval and discarding the packets if the channel state change
   is above a reasonable level for the interval. We leverage the packet
   transmission policies in Wi-Fi to actively elicit packets for the
   channel state check without modifying the Wi-Fi protocol, such as
   sending a dummy data packet which will automatically elicit an
   acknowledgement packet. Comparing to the existing methods that wait
   passively for the packets from the packet sender for the channel state
   information, TBAS has the full control of time to collect the channel
   state, such that it can use stricter rules to classify the packets and
   achieve higher security. We solve key problems in TBAS, including a
   Channel State Check (CSC) procedure which determines if two packets are
   from the same sender, as well as a simple protocol wrapped around CSC to
   reduce the overhead. We implement TBAS on the Sora software defined
   ratio and our trace-driven emulations show that TBAS can achieve
   desirable False Positive and False Negative ratios with very low
   overhead.},

Abstract = {In order to promote the coordinated development of runoff small
   hydropower and the regional distribution network, this paper introduces
   a method for calculating the optimal hosting capacity of runoff small
   hydropower considering adaptive reactive power control. For the purpose
   of improve the security and economy of the operation of the distribution
   network, taking the integrated optimal of operating cost, voltage
   deviation and power loss as the target and adopting multi-state model to
   build a multi-objective model based on chance constrained programming.
   An adaptive reactive power control strategy is employed to solve the
   voltage regulation problem of grid-connected nodes. Moreover,
   non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) based on elitist is
   proposed to solve multi-objective model and technique for order
   preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) based on entropy
   is adopted to choose the optimal solution from Pareto solution set.
   Finally, the simulation results on IEEE 33-bus distribution system
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Title = {Building power consumption datasets: Survey, taxonomy and future
   directions},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {227},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {In the last decade, extended efforts have been poured into energy
   efficiency. Several energy consumption datasets were henceforth
   published, with each dataset varying in properties, uses and
   limitations. For instance, building energy consumption patterns are
   sourced from several sources, including ambient conditions, user
   occupancy, weather conditions and consumer preferences. Thus, a proper
   understanding of the available datasets will result in a strong basis
   for improving energy efficiency. Starting from the necessity of a
   comprehensive review of existing databases, this work is proposed to
   survey, study and visualize the numerical and methodological nature of
   building energy consumption datasets. A total of thirty-one databases
   are examined and compared in terms of several features, such as the
   geographical location, period of collection, number of monitored
   households, sampling rate of collected data, number of sub-metered
   appliances, extracted features and release date. Furthermore, data
   collection platforms and related modules for data transmission, data
   storage and privacy concerns used in different datasets are also
   analyzed and compared. Based on the analytical study, a novel dataset
   has been presented, namely Qatar university dataset, which is an
   annotated power consumption anomaly detection dataset. The latter will
   be very useful for testing and training anomaly detection algorithms,
   and hence reducing wasted energy. Moving forward, a set of
   recommendations is derived to improve datasets collection, such as the
   adoption of multi-modal data collection, smart Internet of things data
   collection, low-cost hardware platforms and privacy and security
   mechanisms. In addition, future directions to improve datasets
   exploitation and utilization are identified, including the use of novel
   machine learning solutions, innovative visualization tools and
   explainable mobile recommender systems. Accordingly, a novel
   visualization strategy based on using power consumption micro-moments
   has been presented along with an example of deploying machine learning
   algorithms to classify the micro-moment classes and identify anomalous
   power usage. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Internet of things refers to billions of interconnected devices that are
   generally equipped with sensors and communication devices. How to make
   Internet of things become a smart terminal is an important topic. By
   connecting cloud services, the devices can receive more accurate
   information so as to be applied in people's daily life. However, the
   smart terminal devices access the cloud services via Representational
   State Transfer (RESTful) application programming interfaces, and how the
   cloud server authenticates and authorizes billions of devices is an
   immense challenge. Additionally, individual use of smart terminal
   devices is accompanied by such problems as privacy data or security.
   This article presents a token-based authorization service framework. The
   devices can have a safer access to cloud services through the token.
   Token is released by a third-party authentication center to improve its
   reliability and security and is featured by a high degree of privacy
   that sensitive data are not easily leaked. Furthermore, the token is
   valid only within a period of time or it will not work after the token
   count exceeds the threshold defined by the system, thereby lowering the
   devices' risk of being hacked. The framework proposed in this article is
   applied to medical wearable devices. The advantages of this framework
   are practical and secure which are explained in the experimental
   chapter.},

Title = {SINT: Toward a Blockchain-Based Secure In-Band Network Telemetry
   Architecture},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {2667-2682},
Abstract = {The foundation of network management is to timely, accurately, and
   flexibly monitor the status of a managed network. Recently, In-band
   Network Telemetry (INT) has presented its unique capabilities in
   acquiring the insights of a network and thus has been adopted in many
   production networks. However, less attention was put on the potential
   threats on INT (e.g., the man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojan horse
   injection) that may falsify network measurements resulting in
   catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose a secure INT
   architecture called SINT that can effectively mitigate INT
   vulnerabilities and can be implemented using `chiplet' based multi-modal
   network processors (MNP). SINT adopts blockchain technology into INT, in
   which a network status snapshot acquired via INT is viewed as a block
   and added into a network telemetry blockchain to prevent arbitrary
   access and malicious modification. To minimize the intrusiveness of the
   INT and blockchain operations, SINT is designed to be a lightweight
   protocol and uses improved RAFT consensus mechanisms to reduce its
   network and computing overhead. The design of the chiplet MNP system
   makes SINT highly flexible and adaptive to facilitate INT convergence
   and related blockchain updates. In the SINT architecture, INT tasks and
   blockchain operations are dispatched to different chips to achieve an
   optimal trade-off among measurement accuracy, security requirements, and
   computing resource on the data plane. Experiments and simulations show
   that SINT can alleviate most cyberattacks on INT and retain 97\% of
   bandwidth utilization for other users' normal traffic in a complex
   scenario with 500 nodes. Furthermore, SINT converges the INT results
   quickly and accurately with minor overhead compared to that of the
   state-of-art INT methods.},

Abstract = {This paper considers partially-observed discrete-event systems where
   sensors are associated with events observable to an agent monitoring the
   system. The agent is capable of turning the sensors for events on and
   off dynamically, depending on the trajectory of the system. Reading data
   from the sensors may be costly so it is imperative that their use be
   reduced for reasons such as energy, bandwidth or security. When a sensor
   for an event is on / active any occurrence of the event is detected by
   the agent and is not detected otherwise. The agent may employ different
   sensor activation policies, depending on the task at hand. Sensor
   activation policies are defined over the transitions of a
   state-transition representation of the system. From sensor activation
   policies a map from observed event sequences to sensor activation
   decisions can be computed which the agent can use to determine which
   sensors to turn on / off and when. In this paper, we consider a subclass
   of sensor activation policies. For this subclass, we demonstrate a way
   to compute maps from observed event sequences to sensor activation
   decisions in polynomial time. However, we demonstrate that verifying if
   an arbitrary sensor activation policy belongs to this subclass is
   PSPACE-complete.},

Abstract = {Australian capital cities are forecast to face decreased average annual
   rainfall by 2030 under mid-emissions climate scenarios. With two-thirds
   of Australia's population already residing in these growing major
   cities, urban water resources pressure will undoubtedly increase in the
   years ahead. Methods to augment traditional reservoir based water supply
   will be required to maintain water security.
   Internally plumbed rain water tank systems (IPRWTs), supplying water at
   a decentralised level, are one potential alternate supply source.
   Incentive schemes and legislation have seen IPRWTs become increasingly
   prevalent in metropolitan areas since widespread drought from 2000-2009.
   For example in Queensland water savings targets were mandated for all
   newly constructed homes. The most common means of meeting these targets
   was through the use of IPRWTs, which when installed were required to
   supply garden irrigation, clothes-washers and cistern flush events.
   Studies to date have been focused on maximising potable savings, such
   that little research has investigated the energy intensity and
   greenhouse gas emissions associated with the operation of IPRWTs. This
   is a worthy consideration given that they are typically thought of as
   green, sustainable solutions.
   This paper examines the energy intensity and greenhouse gas cost of
   IPRWTs under a number of modelled usage scenarios, utilising
   high-resolution end-use level data from a recently conducted IPRWT
   monitoring study in South East Queensland. This modelling, facilitated
   through the use of specialised software, MATLAB and spread-sheet
   software, has determined the average annual energy consumption of
   IPRWTs, taking into account the effect of climatic conditions on water
   consumption. This energy consumption leads to electricity and carbon
   based costs to homeowners and the general community, which have been
   quantified at an end-use level.
   In the interests of system optimisation, the net economic and
   environmental impacts of configuration changes to IPRWTs have been
   considered, such as not plumbing in toilet cisterns. For standard 2.8
   person households preliminary evidence indicates that based only on
   operational costs, more end-uses are preferable, due to higher yields.
   However, when plumbing and environmental costs are taken into account it
   has been found that it may be worthwhile to plumb in only the most
   energy efficient rainwater end-uses (irrigation and clothes washing).
   For larger households, or those consuming large volumes of water in
   regular irrigation, energy intensity of water supply can be
   significantly lowered by only plumbing in efficient end-uses, while
   yearly water savings (from avoided mains costs) fall only by a small
   margin. For retrofitters and new home builders the extra cost incurred
   when plumbing in toilet cisterns to rainwater supply should be
   considered. Existing system owners should note the large increase in
   system energy intensity when small leaks develop from poor maintenance,
   usually from toilet cisterns, as this can lead to significantly greater
   economic and environmental costs over the lifetime of a rainwater system
   and reduce the viability of cistern end-uses.},

   and Evolutionary Game Models over IoT Environment},

Abstract = {The rapid development of Information and Communication Technology and
   the growing number of devices connected to the Internet make the
   Internet of Things (IoT) as a promising technology for a new breed of
   applications. The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks
   (RPL) is a widely applied open standard protocol for IoT networks. The
   RPL routing is highly vulnerable to routing attacks due to the
   constrained nodes. The attacks on the RPL aim to disrupt the optimal
   protocol structure and significantly deteriorating network performance.
   Secure RPL routing schemes attempt to derive a high-level abstract of
   RPL operations through network simulation traces and apply it as a
   reference to differentiate the malicious behavior. The RPL
   specifications include all the states and transitions with its
   corresponding statistics. However, the malicious activities around a
   node enforce it to initiate the unnecessary state transition, and thus,
   the legitimate nodes are equally treated as malicious in dynamic IoT
   network scenarios. Hence, this work proposes a game theoretic model
   based anomaly Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect the RPL attacks
   and verify and confirm their malicious activities. This study formulates
   the Game models based Anomaly Intrusion Detection System (GAIDS) for RPL
   security. The proposed approach consists of two interrelated
   formulations, such as a stochastic game for attack detection and
   evolutionary game for attack confirmation. The stochastic game model
   formulates the activities of the standard RPL rules as a zero-sum
   stochastic game. The stochastic game estimates the payoff by observing
   the states, transitions between them, and their statistics. However,
   there is a possibility to model legitimate players as malicious, due to
   the nature of RPL. Thus, the proposed GAIDS scheme implements the
   evolutionary game theoretic framework on clustered network topology for
   the attack verification. By synchronizing the results of the stochastic
   game of neighboring players, it differentiates the legitimate players
   from the suspected list successfully. As a result, the GAIDS isolates
   the detected attackers and maintains the routing performance. The
   simulation results demonstrate that the detection accuracy and
   throughput of the proposed gaming model based anomaly IDS is
   substantially high and outperforms the existing scheme.},

Abstract = {Radio Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) is the technique which
   identifies the individual radio emitter based on the received signals'
   specific properties called signals' Radio Frequency Fingerprint (RFF).
   SEI is very significant for improving the security of wireless networks.
   A novel SEI method which treats the emitter as a nonlinear dynamical
   system is proposed in this paper. The method works based on the signal's
   nonlinear characteristics which result from the unintentional and
   unavoidable physical-layer imperfections. The reconstructed phase space
   (RPS) is used as the tool for analyzing the nonlinearity. The entire
   characteristics of RPS and state changes characteristics of points in
   RPS are extracted to form RFF. To evaluate the availability of the RFF,
   the signals from four wireless network cards are collected by a signal
   acquisition system. The proposed RFF's discrimination capabilities are
   visually analyzed using the boxplot. The results of visual analysis and
   classification demonstrate that this method is effective.},

Abstract = {Cyber-Physical Energy systems (CPEs) are highly connected and remotely
   controlled systems for energy production, transmission and distribution.
   Failures of CPEs can occur in both their cyber and physical parts and
   may, in both cases, result in significant economic losses, service
   interruption and, even threats to the environment and the population.
   Traditionally, safety and security of CPEs are addressed separately, the
   former dealing with failures in the physical part, the latter with
   breaches in the cyber part. While physical aging is often accounted for,
   it is not for the cyber elements although it may have an impact on CPEs
   controllability, stability and, ultimately, reliability. In this paper,
   we propose a dynamic reliability assessment framework that embeds a
   multi-state cyber aging model of literature into a Goal Tree Success
   Tree-Master Logic Diagram (GTST-MLD) that accounts for both stochastic
   hardware components failures and cyber aging that may open breaches for
   cyber attacks to the control system. The digital Instrumentation and
   Control (I\&C) system of the Advanced Lead-cooled Fast Reactor European
   Demonstrator (ALFRED) is considered as an example to show the
   applicability of the GTST-MLD based dynamic reliability assessment
   method proposed.},

Abstract = {Progress in Microgrid (MG) research has evolved the MG concept from
   classical, purely MG power networks to more advanced power and
   communications networks. The communications infrastructure helps control
   and manage the unreliable power outputs that most standard power
   generation elements of the MG (e.g., wind turbines and photo-voltaic
   panels) deliver. Although communication technologies do offer certain
   advantages for sensing and control, they generate other complications
   due to packet loss and packet latency, among other transmission
   impairments. In this work, we discuss the impact of communications on MG
   performance, establishing the requirements of data exchanges and system
   response in the three levels of a hierarchical control approach:
   primary, secondary, and tertiary. With a focus on the secondary level -
   responsible for ensuring the restoration of electrical parameters - we
   identify standards, networking protocols, and communication technologies
   relevant for the interoperability of MGs and clusters of MGs, including
   both modes of operation: isolated and grid-connected. We review
   theoretical approaches and practical implementations that consider the
   effects of the communications network on the general performance of the
   MG. Moreover, we undertake an experimental analysis of the influence of
   wired and wireless communication networks on MG performance, revealing
   the importance of designing future smart control solutions more robust
   to communication degradation, especially if wireless technologies are
   integrated to provide scalable deployments. Aspects such as resilience,
   security, and interoperability are also shown to require continuing
   efforts in research and practical applications.},

Abstract = {Grid restoration strategies gain in significance since fundamental
   changes inside electrical power grids are in progress. The share in
   volatile energy sources connected through power electronic components
   increases, whereas the installed power of grid-connected generators and
   associated inertia decreases. In this context, critical operating states
   up to system blackouts, that threaten the security of supply and the
   access to electical energy, might occur.
   In order to restore the grid after a blackout in an efficient way, this
   paper proposes an advanced control concept for high voltage direct
   current (HVDC) systems using voltage source converters (VSC) in
   gridforming mode. VSC-HVDC systems open new restoration paths and offer
   the possibility to involve healthy grid areas form a far distance to
   take part in the restoration process. To benefit from the potential of
   renewable energy sources and energy storage devices to support the
   process, established restoration strategies are extended by the
   consistent integration of power electronics and intelligent control
   schemes.
   The presented model predictive controller (MPC) enables precise voltage
   reference tracking inside the restoration area to ensure a grid
   compatible voltage ramp-up process by avoiding undesireable effects, e.
   g. inrush phenomena of transformers. Moreover, the grid frequency is
   used as a system-wide parameter that is used as a physical information
   channel between the grid-forming VSC-HVDC station and further power
   converters inside the restoration area. In that way, renewable energy
   sources and storage devices can contribute to speed up the restoration
   process while guaranteeing system stability.},

Abstract = {The emerging energy crisis resulting from a high price of crude oil has
   drawn attention about renewable energy all over the world. Thailand is a
   developing country located at the heart of Southeast Asia, with about 66
   million of population as of 2006. The electricity supply industry
   structure under the government of Thailand has been managed by the
   Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, the Metropolitan
   Electricity Authority, and the Provincial Electricity Authority for
   almost 50 years. According to the 2004 Power Development Plan, the
   country would have generation reserve at a marginal of 15\%. Due to the
   rapid economic growth and difficulty in building new centralized
   generating facilities, this has the potential to create a security issue
   of electricity energy shortage and may develop a severe system blackout.
   Renewable energy issues have been widely discussed and debated over the
   country. Although solar energy is the most prominent renewable energy
   source due to the appropriate geographic of Thailand, it is still
   considered as a low-density energy source which requires a large area of
   installation. Therefore, for the long-term investment, wind power seems
   to be a good candidate because it is quick to install, needs no fuel
   cost, and is environment friendly. Therefore, this paper investigates
   the impact of the penetration level of wind power generation to be
   integrated into the Thailand system. System stability has been observed
   in various system configuration changes due to different control
   strategies of wind farms. The economic analysis of wind-farm investment
   has been also considered.},

Abstract = {The paper will discuss two installed system designs and methods used to
   transmit a DTT signal over cellular systems.
   This new approach solves the communication reliability problems and
   addresses application security.
   This paper is a case study of 3 installed DTT systems that use cellular
   communication - one system at Central Virginia Electric Cooperative and
   two at Dominion Energy. In this paper the authors will report on the
   design, implementation, performance and issues encountered during and
   post project execution. These intelligent DTT systems have been designed
   to increase availability of the DG by preventing the indiscriminate
   disconnection of the sites. Traditionally Direct Transfer Trip Signals
   (DTT) has been sent between substations and remote Distributed
   Generation (DG) sites using leased telephone lines. If DTT communication
   is interrupted, the DTT system will disconnect the DG site. Leased
   copper lines are becoming less reliable, leading to unwanted
   disconnection of DG sites. Installation of fiber is not always feasible
   due to the cost. This paper will discuss an approach to provide DTT
   signals using wireless communications. The paper will address the
   security concerns that many Utilities might face. Two new innovations to
   increase the DG site's availability will be discussed.
   1) Automatic Direct Transfer Close
   If system conditions return to normal after a DTT event, the system will
   automatically close the DG site back in onto the feeder.
   2) Dynamic Feeder State change protection function.
   Using cellular or wireless communication systems it must be expected
   that there will be communication interruptions during normal maintenance
   actions. During these times the DG site device activates a new
   protection function that will detect any anomalies that could constitute
   a change in the connected feeder systems (e.g. caused by a fault or the
   opening of a breaker) and then only disconnect the DG site.},

Abstract = {Service-oriented architecture provides interoperability and weak
   coupling features for software development. Representational state
   transfer (REST) is an architectural style that has attracted attention
   in the SOA domain as it allows the development of Web services based on
   original principles of the World Wide Web. Unlike Web service
   specifications, which are based on Simple Object Access Protocol and Web
   Services Description Language, REST does not provide official' standards
   to address non-functional requirements of services, such as security,
   reliability, and transaction control. The timestamp-based two-phase
   commit protocol for RESTful service (TS2PC4RS) algorithm specifies
   concurrency control of RESTful services during a transaction. An
   extension of the TS2PC4RS specifies the concurrency control of the Web
   services considering the update operation to meet some business rules.
   However, neither algorithm addresses transaction control when failures
   occur. In long-term transactions, failures can occur and compromise the
   success of Web service applications. Two common failures traditionally
   considered in the analysis of protocols are host and connection
   failures. The aim of this paper is to address fault tolerance for
   TS2PC4RS and its extension. A fault-tolerant protocol based on timeout
   and log records is proposed. The fault-tolerant protocol provides
   support for the host and connection failures that may occur during a
   transaction execution. The fault-tolerant mechanisms are used to meet
   the application domain business rules that guide the behavior of RESTful
   services. We describe the protocol using scenarios when failures occur.

Abstract = {Traditional desktop delivery model is based on a large number of
   distributed PCs executing operating system and desktop applications.
   Managing traditional desktop environments is incredibly challenging and
   costly. Tasks like installations, configuration changes, security
   measures require time-consuming procedures and dedicated deskside
   support. Also these distributed desktops are typically underutilized,
   resulting in low ROI for these assets. Further, this distributed
   computing model for desktops also creates a security concern as
   sensitive information could be compromised with stolen laptops or PCs.
   Desktop virtualization, which moves computation to the data center,
   allows users to access their applications and data using stateless
   ``thin-client{''} devices and therefore alleviates some of the problems
   of traditional desktop computing. Enterprises can now leverage the
   flexibility and cost-benefits of running users' desktops on virtual
   machines hosted at the data center to enhance business agility and
   reduce business risks, while lowering TCO. Recent research and
   development of cloud computing paradigm opens new possibilities of mass
   hosting of desktops and providing them as a service.
   However, transformation of legacy systems to desktop clouds as well as
   proper capacity provisioning is a challenging problem. Desktop cloud
   needs to be appropriately designed and provisioned to offer low response
   time and good working experience to desktop users while optimizing
   back-end resource usage and therefore minimizing provider's costs. This
   paper presents tools and approaches we have developed to facilitate fast
   and accurate planning for desktop clouds. We present desktop workload
   profiling and benchmarking tools as well as desktop to cloud
   transformation process enabling fast and accurate transition of legacy
   systems to new cloud-based model.},

Title = {An algebraic attack to the Bluetooth stream cipher E0},
Journal = {FINITE FIELDS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this paper we study the security of the Bluetooth stream cipher E0
   from the viewpoint it is a ``difference stream cipher{''}, that is, it
   is defined by a system of explicit difference equations over the finite
   field GF(2). This approach highlights some issues of the Bluetooth
   encryption such as the invertibility of its state transition map, a
   special set of 14 bits of its 132-bit state which when guessed implies
   linear equations among the other bits and finally a small number of
   spurious keys, with 83 guessed bits, which are compatible with a
   keystream of about 60 bits. Exploiting these issues, we implement an
   algebraic attack using Grobner bases, SAT solvers and Binary Decision
   Diagrams. Testing activities suggest that the version based on Grobner
   bases is the best one and it is able to attack E0 in about 279 seconds
   on an Intel i9 CPU. To the best of our knowledge, this work improves any
   previous attack based on a short keystream, hence fitting with Bluetooth
   specifications. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An online tripping index to improve microgrid dynamic stability based on
   estimating critical boundary area},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper presents an online index for adaptive protection of
   microgrids concerning the low inertia concept. A three-step approach is
   developed to consider two offline and online environments, and the
   proposed scheme is designed. In Step-1, a comprehensive study of the
   microgrid dynamical model is investigated through two different
   distributed energy resources (DERs), including generator-based and
   inverter-based resources. In this step, based on the low-inertia
   concept, a dynamical model of an adaptive protection scheme is proposed
   through a set of non-model-based indexes. In Step-2, considering online
   evaluations of produced indexes, two different equations are provided in
   the form activation point and triggering point which the corresponding
   adaptive protective zones are provided. In this step, considering
   different operational and topological points of microgrid, the
   protective abilities of proposed indexes are validated and reorganized.
   Finally Step-3 concentrates on the ability of the proposed defensive
   scheme in real-time operating mode. In this step, considering different
   fault scenarios, the accuracy estimation and fast detection of the
   developed protection scheme are investigated, and the microgrid dynamic
   security is evaluated. Results present the effectuality of the proposed
   scheme to fast and secure detection of unstable scenarios using adaptive
   non-model-based signals concerning different system structures. (C) 2021

Abstract = {Successfully employed in the industry, hardware isolation environment
   enhances the access control of traditional operating systems and
   requires more rigorous analysis. This paper first applies the B method
   to the access control mechanism formalization and proposes an extensible
   formal model, which not only specifies the access control mechanism with
   process state transition in Linux, but also introduces the hardware
   isolation description. Consistent with program implementations, the B
   specifications can be animated and verified. The proposed B model
   constructs a mathematical framework for the security analysis, providing
   a theoretical support for mechanism enhancements. All the model
   components are type checked by Atelier B, with 547 proof obligations
   automatically generated. The current rate of model proof is 79\%. The
   experimental results by ProB show that there is no invariant violation
   or deadlock. In conclusion, this paper presents a feasible solution for
   access control mechanism formalization and verification in the embedded
   system design. The access control model can be further extended and
   refined, with its specifications transformed into executable codes after

Title = {Real-time tracking of electromechanical oscillations in ENTSO-e
   Continental European Synchronous Area},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {64},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Small signal stability is a crucial aspect of accurately keeping control
   in modern interconnected power systems, in order to ensure the required
   security and reliability standards. Such an aspect could represent a
   serious limiting factor in the search for ever higher power system
   exploitation levels. Hence, in order to exploit the existing networks as
   much as possible, ensuring at the same time adequate security levels,
   the system operators must monitor the electromechanical oscillations
   continuously, estimating their fundamental parameters (e.g. frequency,
   damping factor/ratio, amplitude and phase), and determining the actual
   dynamic stability margins. Nowadays, electromechanical oscillations
   tracking can be performed in real time thanks to the quick development
   of wide area measurement/monitoring systems, and the employment of
   so-called measurement-based methods (a.k.a. mode meters). In this
   regard, the paper presents a performance comparison among several
   measurement-based methods currently operating on the Italian Wide Area
   Monitoring (WAM) platform. The main objective of this investigation is
   to analyze the behavior of each of them with respect to actual
   critical/not critical electromechanical oscillations recorded on the
   European Network Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-e)
   Continental Synchronous European System (CESA). The considered case
   studies cover a large variety of situations that can be encountered in
   the ordinary ENTSO-e CESA operation: local and inter-area oscillations;
   single mode and multi-mode power signals; ambient and ringdown data; and
   so on. By keeping in mind that usually no best estimator exists, owing
   to the lack of an optimality definition, the present analysis aims at
   examining whether some algorithms are generally more suitable than
   others, with respect to the variety of aforementioned situations. In
   detail, the measurement-based methods considered in this work are the
   Tufts-Kumaresan method, Hankel Singular Value Decomposition-VarPRO,
   Hilbert-Huang Transform, its refined Empirical Mode Decomposition with
   Fourier-Based Masking Technique (R-EMD), and a recently published
   Hilbert Transform-based estimation algorithm. Obviously, this set of
   estimation techniques cannot be considered exhaustive for the research
   problem under analysis. Nonetheless, it represents a collection of the
   major, recent and most fashionable methodologies implemented in actual
   WAM architectures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Model for Risk Calculation and Reliability Comparison of Level Crossings},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {There is not a single country in the world that is so rich that it can
   remove all level crossings or provide their denivelation in order to
   absolutely avoid the possibility of accidents at the intersections of
   railways and road traffic. In the Republic of Serbia alone, the largest
   number of accidents occur at passive crossings, which make up
   three-quarters of the total number of crossings. Therefore, it is
   necessary to constantly find solutions to the problem of priorities when
   choosing level crossings where it is necessary to raise the level of
   security, primarily by analyzing the risk and reliability at all level
   crossings. This paper presents a model that enables this. The
   calculation of the maximal risk of a level crossing is achieved under
   the conditions of generating the maximum entropy in the virtual
   operating mode. The basis of the model is a heterogeneous queuing
   system. Maximum entropy is based on the mandatory application of an
   exponential distribution. The system is Markovian and is solved by a
   standard analytical concept. The basic input parameters for the
   calculation of the maximal risk are the geometric characteristics of the
   level crossing and the intensities and structure of the flows of road
   and railway vehicles. The real risk is based on statistical records of
   accidents and flow intensities. The exact reliability of the level
   crossing is calculated from the ratio of real and maximal risk, which
   enables their further comparison in order to raise the level of safety,
   and that is the basic idea of this paper.},

Abstract = {Standard environments for exploiting idle time of workstations are based
   on some kind of spying process that detects low CPU usage and informs to
   a scheduler so that work can be dispatched. This approach generates
   local interference and, since the same local environment is used, could
   lead to security problems. We are investigating the exploitation of idle
   times in network resources based on a complete mode change in a
   candidate node. After the detection that some node is idle, a
   Mode-Switcher boots a new operating system that will work over a
   separate disk partition. After the boot phase the node is linked to a
   logical network topology and is available to receive jobs. Users can
   allocate nodes from this virtual cluster through a standard front-end as
   they would do in a ``conventional{''} cluster. Because nodes may leave
   and join this virtual machine we use a distributed processor management
   to allow user applications to cope with this dynamic resource behavior.
   In this paper we describe the architecture of the virtual cluster and
   present the results obtained with a Mode-Switcher and a prototype
   application under real use conditions.},

Title = {Evaluation of Voltage Fluctuations Effect on Reconfiguration of
   Distribution Systems},
Journal = {IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 1},
Abstract = {Distribution system operators seriously restrict bus voltage deviations
   within a small range from the nominal voltage to ensure security
   aspects. The distribution network reconfiguration technique is often
   performed to improve these voltage levels, if not to reduce power
   losses. However, distribution systems feed various kinds of consumers,
   and their power demand dependency on bus voltages is different based on
   their load type. Modifying the network configuration changes the
   system's nodal voltage levels, and then the load power is also impacted
   after the reconfiguration. Only a few research works in the field of
   distribution system reconfiguration have included load power dependency
   to nodal voltages in their proposed models. However, these studies have
   not discussed whether adding voltage-depend loads to the reconfiguration
   problem is beneficial or only increases the computational efforts
   without substantial gains on the optimal solution. With the intention to
   fill this gap, this article develops a comprehensive analysis of how the
   change of load according to the voltage affects reconfiguration
   solutions. This investigation aims to help distribution system
   researchers and readers understand this phenomenon and highlight the
   benefits and drawbacks of taking it into account. Also, a robust
   reconfiguration model for considering load types and nodal voltage is
   proposed. The model is validated in different network models and sizes,
   where the obtained results are compared with other models presented in
   the literature. The results analysis indicates that voltage fluctuations
   impact the distribution network configuration through voltage effect on
   power losses and the system nodal loads. Also, load voltage-dependent
   models are more flexible than constant demand based-formulations in
   finding feasible solutions in more restricted voltage tolerances.},

Title = {A new wind power prediction method based on chaotic theory and Bernstein
   Neural Network},

Abstract = {The accuracy of wind power prediction is important for assessing the
   security and economy of the system operation when wind power connects to
   the grids. However, multiple factors cause a long delay and large errors
   in wind power prediction. Hence, efficient wind power forecasting
   approaches are still required for practical applications. In this paper,
   a new wind power forecasting method based on Chaos Theory and Bernstein
   Neural Network (BNN) is proposed. Firstly, the largest Lyapunov exponent
   as a judgment for wind power system's chaotic behavior is made.
   Secondly, Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR) is used to reconstruct the
   wind power series' phase space. Thirdly, the prediction model is
   constructed using the Bernstein polynomial and neural network. Finally,
   the weights and thresholds of the model are optimized by Primal Dual
   State Transition Algorithm (PDSTA). The practical hourly data of wind
   power generation in Xinjiang is used to test this forecaster. The
   proposed forecaster is compared with several current prominent research
   findings. Analytical results indicate that the forecasting error of
   PDSTA BNN is 3.893\% for 24 look-ahead hours, and has lower errors
   obtained compared with the other forecast methods discussed in this
   paper. The results of all cases studying confirm the validity of the new

Abstract = {With the rapid development of blockchain, the concept of decentralized
   applications (DApps), built upon smart contracts, has attracted much
   attention in academia and industry. However, significant issues w.r.t.
   system throughput, transaction confidentiality, and the security
   guarantee of the DApp transaction execution and order correctness hinder
   the border adoption of blockchain DApps.
   To address these issues, we propose L2chain, a novel blockchain
   framework aiming to scale the system through a layer-2 network where
   DApps process transactions in the layer-2 network and only the system
   state digest, acting as the state integrity proof, is maintained
   on-chain. To achieve high performance, we introduce the
   split-execute-merge (SEM) transaction processing workflow with the help
   of the RSA accumulator, allowing DApps to lock and update a part of the
   state digest in parallel. We also design a witness cache mechanism for
   DApp executors to reduce the transaction processing latency. To fulfill
   confidentiality, we leverage the trusted execution environment (TEE) for
   DApps to execute encrypted transactions off-chain. To ensure transaction
   execution and order correctness, we propose a two-step execution process
   for DApps to prevent attacks (i.e., rollback attacks) from subverting
   the state transition. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that
   L2chain can achieve 1.5X to 42.2X and 7.1X to 8.9X throughput
   improvements in permissioned and permissionless settings respectively.},

Abstract = {Classified information protection is regulated by dedicated acts and
   related laws that require use of necessary physical, personal,
   information and communication technologies, electromagnetic and
   cryptographic security measures. Equipment and tools for cryptographic
   protection of classified information should be examined and assessed by
   the designated government services. Certificates issued by these
   services authorize the use of cryptographic devices to protect
   classified information, but this is not a sufficient condition. Each ICT
   system intended for processing classified information is subject to
   accreditation. All this makes the process of reaching the right level of
   protection for this type of information long and expensive - especially
   if this protection should be effectively provided in the battlefield.
   Additional specific requirements are put on information protection
   measures for radio communication, especially military, where radio
   transmission is characterized by uncertainty of establishing and
   maintaining connections, bit rates are lower than in cable or fiber
   optic connections, most often there is no full duplex. All this has an
   impact on the methods of cryptographic synchronization and
   implementation of cryptographic functions. A different approach to
   information protection is required by classic narrowband radio
   communications, a different one in time-division multi-access mode, and
   another one in broadband packet data transmission. Systems designed for
   the protection of classified information in radio communications
   implement appropriate operating modes of operation for cryptographic
   algorithms and protocols. Latest threats from quantum computers pose new
   challenges to the cryptographic protection, especially in systems using
   public key cryptography, because there are algorithms that can be used
   to attack public-key schemes with polynomial complexity.},

Abstract = {The immutable feature of blockchain determines that traditional security
   response mechanisms (e.g., code patching) must change to remedy insecure
   smart contracts. The only proper way to protect a smart contract is to
   fix potential risks in its code before it is deployed to the blockchain.
   However, existing tools for smart contract security analysis focus on
   the detection of bugs but seldom consider the code fix issues.
   Meanwhile, it is often time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to
   understand and fix flawed code manually. In this paper we propose SMART
   SHIELD, a bytecode rectification system, to fix three typical
   security-related bugs (i.e., state changes after external calls, missing
   checks for out-of-bound arithmetic operations, and missing checks for
   failing external calls) in smart contracts automatically and help
   developers release secure contracts. Moreover, SMART SHIELD guarantees
   that the rectified contract is not only immune to certain attacks but
   also gas-friendly (i.e., a slightly increase of gas cost). To evaluate
   the effectiveness and efficiency of SMART SHIELD, we applied it to
   28,621 real-world buggy contracts on Ethereum blockchain (as of January
   2nd 2019). Experiment results demonstrated that among 95,502 insecure
   cases in those contracts, 87,346 (91.5\%) of them were automatically
   fixed by SMART SHIELD. A following test with both program analysis and
   real-world exploits further testified that the rectified contracts were
   secure against common attacks. Moreover, the rectification only
   introduced a 0.2\% gas increment for each contract on average.},

Title = {A Continuation Power Flow Model of Multi-Area AC/DC Interconnected Bulk
   Systems Incorporating Voltage Source Converter-Based Multi-Terminal DC
   Networks and Its Decoupling Algorithm},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},

Month = {FEB 2},
Abstract = {Existing continuation power flow (CPF) models mainly focus on the
   regional independent systems, which are not suitable for multi-area
   AC/DC interconnected systems because the market trading behaviors and
   security control for power allocation of tie-lines are ignored. This
   study presents a novel CPF model and its decoupling algorithm for
   multi-area AC/DC interconnected systems incorporating a voltage source
   converter (VSC)-based multi-terminal direct current (MTDC) network. This
   CPF model includes the following unique features: (1) In view of the
   bilateral power trading contracts among regional subsystems, the
   nonlinear constraint equations of directional trading active power via
   interface are derived, and the multi-balancing machine strategy is
   introduced to realize the active power balance of each subsystem. (2) An
   accurate simulation method for the security control behaviors of the
   power allocation in tie-lines is proposed, which includes a specific
   selection strategy for automatic generation control units and a
   generation re-dispatch strategy. These two strategies work together to
   prevent the serious overload in tie-lines during load growth and improve
   the voltage stability margin of the interconnected bulk systems. (3) The
   switching characteristic of reactive power control behaviors of VSC
   stations is simulated in the CPF calculation. In the end, a novel
   decoupling CPF algorithm based on bi-directional iteration is presented
   to realize the decomposition and coordination calculation. This
   decoupling algorithm preserves the precision and convergence of
   integrated CPF algorithms, and it has an apparent advantage on the
   calculation speed. Furthermore, this decoupling algorithm also can
   easily reflects the effects of the control mode changes of VSC stations
   to the voltage stability margin of AC system. Case studies and
   comparative analysis on the IEEE two-area RTS-96 system indicate the
   effectiveness and validity of the proposed CPF model and corresponding
   decoupling algorithm.},

Abstract = {Speculative execution, the base on which modern high-performance
   general-purpose CPUs are built on, has recently been shown to enable a
   slew of security attacks. All these attacks are centered around a common
   set of behaviors: During speculative execution, the architectural state
   of the system is kept unmodified, until the speculation can be verified.
   In the event that a misspeculation occurs, then anything that can affect
   the architectural state is reverted (squashed) and re-executed
   correctly. However, the same is not true for the microarchitectural
   state. Normally invisible to the user, changes to the microarchitectural
   state can be observed through various side-channels, with timing
   differences caused by the memory hierarchy being one of the most common
   and easy to exploit. The speculative side-channels can then be exploited
   to perform attacks that can bypass software and hardware checks in order
   to leak information. These attacks, out of which the most infamous are
   perhaps Spectre and Meltdown, have led to a frantic search for
   solutions.
   In this work, we present our own solution for reducing the
   microarchitectural state-changes caused by speculative execution in the
   memory hierarchy. It is based on the observation that if we only allow
   accesses that hit in the L1 data cache to proceed, then we can easily
   hide any microarchitectural changes until after the speculation has been
   verified. At the same time, we propose to prevent stalls by value
   predicting the loads that miss in the L1. Value prediction, though
   speculative, constitutes an invisible form of speculation, not seen
   outside the core. We evaluate our solution and show that we can prevent
   observable microarchitectural changes in the memory hierarchy while
   keeping the performance and energy costs at 11\% and 7\%, respectively.
   In comparison, the current state of the art solution, InvisiSpec, incurs
   a 46\% performance loss and a 51\% energy increase.},

Title = {Prediction and forewarning of axial force of steel bracing in foundation
   pit based on verhulst model},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {The axial force of steel bracing is one of the essential indexes to
   measure the stability of the bracing system of a foundation pit. The
   steel bracing system of a foundation pit in Ningbo City, China was taken
   as the research object to guarantee the stability of the steel bracing
   system of the foundation pit. Besides, the change of axial force between
   the two steel bracing structures was analyzed to predict the axial force
   data of the steel bracing and perform the safety forewarning of the
   steel bracing system. Firstly, GM (1,1) and Verhulst models in the gray
   model were selected for prediction based on the characteristics of poor
   information and the small sample size of original monitoring data of the
   steel bracing. Secondly, the precision of the GM (1,1) model and
   Verhulst model was compared to determine a more accurate prediction
   method. Finally, the safety forewarning model of the confidence interval
   estimation method was established based on the data obtained from the
   prediction model and the deformation characteristics and indexes of the
   steel bracing. With the significance levels alpha = 5\% and alpha = 2\%
   as the demarcating points, the forewarning grades of the steel bracing
   system of the deep foundation pit were divided, and then the operating
   state of the current steel bracing system was determined. The results
   demonstrated that the Verhulst model had better prediction precision
   compared with the ordinary GM (1, 1) model. Besides, the steel bracing
   system was in the safe operation range, and the judgment results of the
   model were consistent with the actual situation of the foundation pit of
   the steel bracing system. Thus, the Verhulst prediction model and the

Abstract = {A finite state machine (FSM) is responsible for controlling the overall
   functionality of most digital systems and, therefore, the security of
   the whole system can be compromised if there are vulnerabilities in the
   FSM. These vulnerabilities can be created by improper designs or by the
   synthesis tool which introduces additional don't-care states and
   transitions during the optimization and synthesis process. An attacker
   can utilize these vulnerabilities to perform fault injection attacks or
   insert malicious hardware modifications (Trojan) to gain unauthorized
   access to some specific states. To our knowledge, no systematic
   approaches have been proposed to analyze these vulnerabilities in FSM.
   In this paper, we develop a framework named Analyzing Vulnerabilities in
   FSM (AVFSM) which extracts the state transition graph (including the
   don't-care states and transitions) from a gate-level netlist using a
   novel Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) based approach and
   quantifies the vulnerabilities of the design to fault injection and
   hardware Trojan insertion. We demonstrate the applicability of the AVFSM
   framework by analyzing the vulnerabilities in the FSM of AES and RSA
   encryption module. We also propose a low-cost mitigation technique to
   make FSM more secure against these attacks.},

Title = {Identification of damage in composite structures using Gaussian mixture
   model-processed Lamb waves},
Journal = {SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Composite materials have comprehensively better properties than
   traditional materials, and therefore have been more and more widely
   used, especially because of its higher strength-weight ratio. However,
   the damage of composite structures is usually varied and complicated. In
   order to ensure the security of these structures, it is necessary to
   monitor and distinguish the structural damage in a timely manner. Lamb
   wave-based structural health monitoring (SHM) has been proved to be
   effective in online structural damage detection and evaluation;
   furthermore, the characteristic parameters of the multi-mode Lamb wave
   varies in response to different types of damage in the composite
   material. This paper studies the damage identification approach for
   composite structures using the Lamb wave and the Gaussian mixture model
   (GMM). The algorithm and principle of the GMM, and the parameter
   estimation, is introduced. Multistatistical characteristic parameters of
   the excited Lamb waves are extracted, and the parameter space with
   reduced dimensions is adopted by principal component analysis (PCA). The
   damage identification system using the GMM is then established through
   training. Experiments on a glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composite
   laminate plate are conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed
   approach in terms of damage classification. The experimental results
   show that different types of damage can be identified according to the
   value of the likelihood function of the GMM.},

Title = {Trustworthy Transaction Spreading Using Node Reliability Estimation in
   IoT Blockchain Networks},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Featured Application Blockchain-powered IoT Applications, such as
   agricultural applications, logistics, and smart factory data management.
   Blockchain network architecture is a promising technology for
   constructing highly secure Internet of Things (IoT) networks. IoT
   networks typically comprise various sensors and actuators. Blockchain
   network technology can be applied to secure control robots in smart
   factories or reliable drone deliveries in smart cities. The wide spread
   of transactions and shared smart contracts across blockchain networks
   guarantees ultimate network security. A typical wired blockchain network
   maintains sufficient redundancy within a stable configuration. However,
   IoT blockchain networks exhibit unavoidable instability. The dynamic
   configuration changes caused by flexible node membership make it
   impossible to achieve the same level of redundancy as a stable network.
   A trustworthy transaction spreading method provides practical
   transaction sharing for dynamic IoT networks. We propose a Q-learning
   framework and a graph convergence network (GCN) to search for the proper
   spreading path of each transaction. The proposed Q-learning framework
   determines the next spreading hop using node features. The GCN
   determines the reliable area based on the Q-learning results. The
   discovered reliable area guides the proper spreading path of
   transactions to the destination node. In addition, the proposed
   trustworthy transaction spreading was implemented over an InterPlanetary
   File system (IPFS). The IPFS-powered experiments confirmed the
   practicability of the proposed transaction spreading mechanism.},

Abstract = {We discuss research issues pertinent to providing reliable server
   pooling in military mobile ad-hoc networks. To persistently maintain
   connections for military applications even as links and nodes migrate or
   become disabled, server pooling is used to increase system availability
   by allowing a pool of redundant information sources to be viewed as a
   single transport endpoint. We aim to design reliable server pooling for
   networks that are highly mobile, have limited processing power, and are
   capable of rapid self-configuration and autoaddressing of nodes and
   interfaces. Novel aspects of our research are also the investigation of
   server pooling with respect to both end-user applications and
   infrastructure components, extensible, intelligent server selection
   policies to select pool elements more proactively, as well as an
   application's and the security middleware's state transfer. We define
   the following key architectural requirements for reliable server pooling
   in mobile ad-hoc networks: (1) fast switchover, (2) dynamic
   (re-)configuration, (3) survivability, (4) application transparency, and
   (5) control signal efficiency. The paper describes in detail how the
   above requirements are being addressed in our research, and presents the
   initial approaches to solutions.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, Android is one of the most popular operating systems for
   mobile devices. Therefore, an increasing number of exploits and
   malicious applications for Android are developed by attackers. Many
   Android applications have malicious or abnormal behaviour: stealing
   private information, subscribing to unwanted paid services, consuming a
   large amount of resources on the device and displaying unwanted
   advertisements. Students learning security need to understand the
   behaviour of such applications. In this paper, we propose an
   infrastructure for collecting information pertaining to application
   behaviour at runtime and exposing the malicious and atypical actions
   performed by Android applications. The purpose of this infrastructure is
   to provide a meaningful learning experience to students, as they study
   malicious applications. The infrastructure includes collectors at every
   level of the operating system and the behaviour information includes:
   the consumed resources (CPU, memory), the exchanged messages (SMSs,
   phone calls, packets), the state changes of the communication channels
   (WiFi, 3G, Bluetooth, NFC). Behaviour information is sent periodically
   from the collectors to a native application and can be visualised
   through a Graphical User Interface, directly on the mobile device.
   Students are allowed to select any process in the system and investigate
   its behaviour in real time. They also can extract the behaviour
   information from the mobile device in order to perform statistical
   analysis on the data. Students are able compare the collected data for
   legitimate and malicious/abnormal applications and identify the
   malicious behaviour patterns. These patterns can be used to discover new
   malware, that is not yet detected by commercial antivirus solutions. The
   learning experience provided by our infrastructure is essential for
   developing practical security skills.},

Abstract = {Objective: The purpose Of the present study was to examine the
   relationship between household food insecurity and maternal depression
   in a rural sample to determine whether food insecurity predicted
   mothers' depression over time or vice versa.
   Design: The study employed a prospective design using three waves of
   data from `Rural Families Speak', a multi-state study of low-income
   rural families in the USA. Food insecurity was measured using the Core
   Food Security Module and depression was measured using the Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. A structural equation model was
   fit to the data using the AMOS software package.
   Setting: Sixteen states in the USA (California, Indiana, Kentucky,
   Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New
   Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wyoming)
   between 2000 and 2002.
   Subjects: Subjects included 413 women with at least one child under the
   age of 13 years living in the home.
   Results: Findings based on the 184 subjects with complete data indicated
   that the causal relationship between household food insecurity and
   depression is bidirectional (P=0.034 for causation from depression to
   food insecurity, P=0.003 for causation from food insecurity to
   depression,) chi(2)/df = 1.835, root-mean-square error of approximation
   = 0.068, comaparative fit index = 0.989). Findings based on all 413
   subjects; after imputation of missing Values also indicated
   bidirectionality.
   Conclusions: The recursive relationship between food insecurity and
   depression has implications for US nutrition, Mental health and poverty
   policies. The study highlights the need to integrate programmes
   addressing food insecurity and poor mental health for the population of
   rural, low-income women.},

   low-carbon city is an important carrier of energy-saving and
   emission-reduction and the development of low-carbon economy. It not
   only provides the bottleneck of urban development with solutions and
   affords a new opportunity, but also has great significance for
   addressing climate change and making urban development sustainable. From
   the point of theory combined with practice, this article carries out a
   research on the functions in the construction of low-carbon city. Not
   only is this research an impulse for the research on the shift in the
   government functions and the innovation of ways of government
   administration, it is also a breakthrough of the promotion of the
   governance, which has the profound practical and theoretical
   significance. Starting with the conception of the new construction
   system of low-carbon city, the article analyses the background,
   connotation, elements and operating mode of the construction of
   low-carbon city. Based on it, this article also researches into the
   current situation of the construction of low-carbon city and puts
   forward the government functions, building on ideas and successful
   experiences from abroad. The government in the construction of
   low-carbon is the rule-makers, guide of building orientation, supplier
   for service operation as well as the coordinator and supervisor of
   building operations. In this way, a new idea to develop the low-carbon
   city can be put forward in the course of China's urbanization.},

Title = {Crowd macro state detection using entropy model},
Journal = {PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {431},
Pages = {84-93},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {In the crowd security research area a primary concern is to identify the
   macro state of crowd behaviors to prevent disasters and to supervise the
   crowd behaviors. The entropy is used to describe the macro state of a
   self-organization system in physics. The entropy change indicates the
   system macro state change. This paper provides a method to construct
   crowd behavior microstates and the corresponded probability distribution
   using the individuals' velocity information (magnitude and direction).
   Then an entropy model was built up to describe the crowd behavior macro
   state. Simulation experiments and video detection experiments were
   conducted. It was verified that in the disordered state, the crowd
   behavior entropy is close to the theoretical maximum entropy; while in
   ordered state, the entropy is much lower than half of the theoretical
   maximum entropy. The crowd behavior macro state sudden change leads to
   the entropy change. The proposed entropy model is more applicable than
   the order parameter model in crowd behavior detection. By recognizing
   the entropy mutation, it is possible to detect the crowd behavior macro
   state automatically by utilizing cameras. Results will provide data
   support on crowd emergency prevention and on emergency manual
   intervention. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Croppers to livestock keepers: livelihood transitions to 2050 in Africa
   due to climate change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {427-437},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The impacts of climate change are expected to be generally detrimental
   for agriculture in many parts of Africa. Overall, warming and drying may
   reduce crop yields by 10-20\% to 2050, but there are places where losses
   are likely to be much more severe. Increasing frequencies of heat
   stress, drought and flooding events will result in yet further
   deleterious effects on crop and livestock productivity. There will be
   places in the coming decades where the livelihood strategies of rural
   people may need to change, to preserve food security and provide
   income-generating options. These are likely to include areas of Africa
   that are already marginal for crop production; as these become
   increasingly marginal, then livestock may provide an alternative to
   cropping. We carried out some analysis to identify areas in sub-Saharan
   Africa where such transitions might occur. For the currently cropped
   areas (which already include the highland areas where cropping intensity
   may increase in the future), we estimated probabilities of failed
   seasons for current: climate conditions, and compared these with
   estimates obtained for future climate conditions in 2050, using
   downscaled climate model output for a higher and a lower greenhouse-gas
   emission scenario. Transition zones can be identified where the
   increased probabilities of failed seasons may induce shifts from
   cropping to increased dependence on livestock. These zones are
   characterised in terms of existing agricultural system, current
   livestock densities, and levels of poverty. The analysis provides
   further evidence that climate change impacts in the marginal cropping
   lands may be severe, where poverty rates are already high. Results also
   suggest that those likely to be more affected are already more poor, on
   average. We discuss the implications of these results in a
   research-for-development targeting context that is likely to see the
   poor disproportionately and negatively affected by climate change. (C)

Abstract = {The world has changed dramatically since the Cold War when there were
   two super powers. Then, it was relatively simple to identify our
   intelligence collection targets. It was sometimes hard to collect the
   intelligence, but the targets were clear. Today we live in a world of
   asymmetries. The most serious asymmetric threat facing the United States
   today is terrorism; a threat characterized by collections of loosely
   organized people who operate in shadowy networks that are difficult to
   identify and define and whose goal is the destruction of our way of
   life. The intelligence collection targets are thousands of people whose
   identities and whereabouts we do not always know.
   If we are to preserve our national security, we must figure out a way of
   combating this threat. The solution is largely associated with
   information technology. We must become much more efficient and clever in
   the ways we use existing sources of data to find new sources of data,
   mine it for new information, generate context relevant information, make
   it widely available for collaborative analysis, convert it to knowledge
   and create actionable options for senior decision-makers. Also. we need
   a more systemic approach to the problem. A variety of tools, processes
   and procedures will be required to deal with this problem, however, to
   be effective, they must be integrated and harmonized within a system
   context built around a common architecture.
   In this paper, we will provide a broad overview of the Total Information
   Awareness (TIA) program - a new counter terrorism initiative sponsored
   by the Information Awareness Office (IAO) at the Defense Advanced
   Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The TIA program will develop and
   integrate a variety of information technologies enabling early warning
   and understanding of terrorist activities and ultimately the preemption
   of terrorist attacks through collaborative decision making at the
   national security level. Examples of some of the key technologies needed
   for TIA include: entity and event detection and extraction, link
   discovery and pattern learning across space and time, human language
   exploitation including summarization and translation, biometrics and
   multi-modal techniques for human identification, various methods for
   privacy protection and policy formulation, and several prediction and
   estimation approaches to understand individual and group behavior and
   intent. TIA will also require concepts and methods for bringing users
   with diverse points of view together in a collaborative problem-solving
   environment, where they can have access to their relevant data sources,
   the use of discovery tools and the ability to exploit and quickly
   generate models for structured arguments that facilitate the
   presentation and vetting of competing hypotheses.},

Title = {Evaluating REST architectures-Approach, tooling and guidelines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {156-180},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Architectural decisions determine the ability of the implemented system
   to satisfy functional and quality attribute requirements. The
   Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style has been
   extensively used recently for integrating services and applications. Its
   adoption to build SOA-based distributed systems brings several benefits,
   but also poses new challenges and risks. Particularly important among
   those risks are failures to effectively address quality attribute
   requirements such as security, reliability, and performance. A proved
   efficient technique to identify and help mitigate those risks is the
   architecture evaluation. In this paper we propose an approach, tooling,
   and guidelines to aid architecture evaluation activities in REST-based
   systems. These guidelines can be systematically used along with
   evaluation methods to reason about design considerations and tradeoffs.
   To demonstrate how the guidelines can help architecture evaluators, we
   present a proof of concept describing how to use the guidelines in an
   ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) evaluation. We also present
   the results of a survey conducted with industry specialists who have
   performed architecture evaluations in real world REST-based systems in
   order to gauge the suitability and utility of the proposed guidelines.
   Finally, the paper describes a Web tool developed to facilitate the use
   of the evaluation guidelines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a practical method for
   computing contingency-based reliability and quality indices in power
   systems and to answer questions related to how much the system is
   reliable, how robust it is in surviving random contingencies, how much
   it is costing to maintain appropriate system security and reliability
   levels and, finally, to what extent the desired balance is maintained
   between generation facilities, transmission capabilities and consumer
   demand levels in various zones of the electric power system.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methodology adopted in this paper is
   based on a combined contingency analysis/reliability evaluation scheme.
   A three-component system model is utilized, which can be used
   effectively for evaluation and sensitivity analysis of reliability and
   quality in power systems. The model is a reduced (equivalent) system
   representation that comprises generation, transmission and load
   components with multi-state values. The computational scheme presented
   in the paper integrates both the contingency effect and its probability
   of occurrence into one routine of analysis while reducing the power
   system around the region of interest.
   Findings - The computational scheme presented in the paper can
   effectively assess both service reliability and system quality. The
   practical applications presented demonstrated that lower service
   reliability levels would jeopardize energy supply continuity and
   increase the likelihood of additional maintenance and restoration costs
   due to the resulting higher rate of system outages. Poor system quality
   levels, on the other hand, imply either deficiency or excess in the
   overall system capabilities as designed by its planners.
   Originality/value - The work of this paper contributes to the solution
   of the reliability and quality assessment problem in practical power
   systems. As part of the present work, an advanced computerized scheme
   for fast composite system reliability and quality assessment was
   developed and then applied to an equivalent system model of the Saudi
   electricity system. The results obtained are claimed to have
   far-reaching implications on various planning and operation aspects of
   the power system.},

Abstract = {Blockchain technology supports data immutability. Whereas, smart
   contracts are piece of self-executable codes running inside the
   blockchain network, responsible for the transformation or state change
   of these data. Furthermore, Cloud Computing is used in the application
   of data storage and usage. Several business enterprises use cloud for
   hosting their applications and data with a minimized effort, cost and
   hurdles of maintenance. However, ensuring security of client data and
   proper management of the Service Provider's infrastructure remains a
   crucial issue. In this article, an Ethereum based blockchain network has
   been proposed that monitors and assures the safety of the VirtualMachine
   Images (VMI) stored at the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) end. The
   proposed scheme tends to design a dedicated Smart Contract which handles
   each and every function, starting from request of a VMI by the Cloud
   Service Consumer (CSC) to the usage of the same by the later. The use of
   blockchain technology ensures that no single admin/third party can
   control/modify the system. This prevents unwanted modification of the
   VMIs by an intruder and guarantees the efficiency of the scheme to be
   higher than any other methodology designed for the same purpose till

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of hidden faults, which is seen like a
   growth one inherent in modern safety-related systems. The special
   feature of these is the designing for operation in two modes: normal and
   emergency. Digital components can accumulate hidden failures over a
   long-term normal mode. This reduces their fault tolerance and functional
   safety of the system in the most responsible emergency mode. Two
   conditions for occurrence of the hidden fault problem as a growth one
   are considered in view of a resource approach, which in the development
   of models, methods and means highlights levels of replication and
   diversification. Safety-related systems are analyzed as computer systems
   that have increased to the level of diversification to address the
   security challenge. Their components are still stamped at a level of
   resource replication using matrix structures to process data in parallel
   codes. Fault-tolerant solutions become fault-safe with a sufficient
   level of circuit checkability, which is commonly known as testability,
   i.e. structural checkability, depending only on the structure of the
   circuit. In the operating mode, the checkability becomes
   structurally-functional, and in critical applications it is converted
   into a dual-mode, the shortage of which causes the hidden fault problem.
   A method of analyzing circuits for the possibility of hidden faults is
   suggested. The method is illustrated on example of an iterative array
   multiplier implemented in an FPGA project with a LUT-oriented
   architecture. A program model for the resulting scheme has been
   developed and potentially dangerous points have been found in it in
   which the hidden fault problem of may manifest itself.},

Abstract = {Optical fiber channels are used as media to transfer the information
   globally. This paper presents an implementation of a novel procedure
   using which a secured communication between two parties can be carried
   out using polarized beam of light over an optical fiber. The paper
   presents the experimental results obtained of the procedure in the lab
   environment and a security analysis of the same. It is observed that
   polarization state of a light pulse cannot be retained as it travels
   over an optical fiber because of the birefringence phenomenon. Multiple
   environmental factors such as pressure, vibration, temperature, etc.
   also add a non-linearity to the birefringence of an optical fiber
   leading towards an unpredictable polarization state changes over the
   course of an optical fiber. The proposed procedure helps the receiving
   party to successfully retrieve the data in the form of a polarization
   state transmitted by the sending party without having any knowledge
   about the state of polarization at the transmitting end. The paper also
   explains an added layer of security the procedure provides to the
   communicating parties to make it difficult for an adversary to fetch the
   data being transferred. The proposed system does not depend on the
   wavelength of the light being used, nor does it depend upon the type of
   the optical fiber used for the communication. Using this procedure,
   multiple bits of secured information can be sent over an optical fiber
   in a single polarized pulse and retrieved at the receiving end, also
   known as Polarization Shift Keying.},

Abstract = {The security of smartphone GUI frameworks remains an important yet
   under-scrutinized topic. In this paper, we report that on the Android
   system (and likely other OSes), a weaker form of GUI confidentiality can
   be breached in the form of UI state (not the pixels) by a background app
   without requiring any permissions. Our finding leads to a class of
   attacks which we nameUI state inference attack. The underlying problem
   is that popular GUI frameworks by design can potentially reveal every UI
   state change through a newly-discovered public side channel - shared
   memory. In our evaluation, we show that for 6 out of 7 popular Android
   apps, the UI state inference accuracies are 80-90\% for the first
   candidate UI states, and over 93\% for the top 3 candidates.
   Even though the UI state does not reveal the exact pixels, we show that
   it can serve as a powerful building block to enable more serious
   attacks. To demonstrate this, we design and fully implement several new
   attacks based on the UI state inference attack, including hijacking the
   UI state to steal sensitive user input (e.g., login credentials) and
   obtain sensitive camera images shot by the user (e.g., personal check
   photos for banking apps). We also discuss non-trivial challenges in
   eliminating the identified side channel, and suggest more secure
   alternative system designs.},

Abstract = {Due to increasing incidents of security breaches in the cyber space, a
   rigorous user authentication process has become crucial. A very feasible
   biometric approach to verify the authenticity of a user is to examine
   his/her typing patterns. There is a significant difference in the
   keystroke patterns exhibited from person to person, even when asked to
   type the same words. Typing patterns can be shown in the intervals
   between keys, holding time, overlap keys, etc. Individual's typing
   pattern develops naturally and uniquely just as each person writes
   differently.
   We propose an analytical process based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) to
   learn the special patterns from individuals, and then to identify them.
   During training, the timing information of each keystroke is recorded at
   its holding and releasing events, and the pattern is then extracted from
   the relationship of the events within a word. The experiment to be
   conducted is to authenticate users when entering words. The idea is to
   implement a process to examine the typing pattern as a user enters
   higher password, in order to augment the conventional password system.
   We find the discrete first-order HMM to be very suitable for our
   purpose. Due to the non-deterministic nature of the keystroke events,
   modeling with a stochastic process such as the HMM which has
   probabilistic state transitions can not only recognize the patterns in
   the keys already typed, but also predict the following sequence. The
   issue is similar to the recognition of hand-written characters or spoken
   words. The experimental results are nearly perfect among twenty test
   subjects all randomly chosen in a controlled environment of a standard
   computer laboratory.},

Abstract = {In order to improve the comprehensive performance of energy dispatching
   between different sites, the optimization research of particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) algorithm and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm
   is carried out. We proposed a new improved PSO-ACO algorithm based on
   the idea of hybrid algorithm to solve the problem of poor energy
   dispatching efficiency between sites. First, the multiobjective
   performance indicators were introduced to transform the sites' energy
   dispatching problem into a multiobjective optimization problem. Second,
   the vitality factor was introduced into the PSO strategy to solve the
   local optimal problem, and in the PSO-ACO fusion strategy, the PSO
   routes were transformed into the ant colony enhancement pheromone to
   accelerate the accumulation speed of the ACO initial pheromone. Then,
   the angle guidance function was introduced into the state transition
   probability of the ACO strategy to improve the global search capability,
   and a high-quality pheromone update rule was proposed to improve the
   convergence speed of the algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments were
   carried out on the improved PSO-ACO algorithm, Min-Max Ant System (MMAS)
   algorithm, ACO algorithm, PSO algorithm, and PSO update algorithm in a
   variety of complex site scenarios. The simulation results show that the
   improved PSO-ACO algorithm can plan a site energy dispatching route with
   shorter route, less time-consuming, and higher security and realize the
   comprehensive and global optimization of energy dispatching.},

Abstract = {As the next-generation power grids, smart grids are integrated with
   advanced information and communication technology (ICT) to make the grid
   more efficient and stable than conventional power systems. Given the
   mounting cyber-attack threats, these critical ICT systems create great
   security issues for smart grids. Additionally, the clever attackers have
   the ability to not only access and monitor the smart grid, but also hack
   it by launching well-established cyber-attacks. Thus, this article is
   devoted to understanding the potential stealthy cyber-attack and its
   countermeasure. First, this article proposes a stealthy sparse
   cyber-attack model in an ac smart grid by considering both the residual
   test-based detector and the interval-state-estimation-based detector,
   which is not considered in previous studies. The design model is
   formulated as a constrained optimization problem by minimizing the
   number of contaminated meters, where the characteristics of two types of
   detector are considered simultaneously as the constraints for the first
   time. A constrained differential evolution (CDE) is proposed as the
   solver because the optimization problem is NP-hard. Then, a
   generalized-cumulative-sum-based detector is developed to detect the
   proposed cyber-attacks, where a fractional-order state transition matrix
   is originally introduced into the estimator to describe the dynamics of
   the power system. Numerical studies illustrate the feasibility of
   CDE-based stealthy sparse cyber-attacks and the effectiveness of the
   proposed countermeasure.},

Abstract = {Airport operation gets more complicated due to the increasing
   interconnectivity of the infrastructure and the dependency on advances
   in information and communication systems. There exist a manifold of
   different reasons for system failures of devices starting from
   short-circuits, hardware defects or malware infections reaching to power
   shortages or complete blackouts. Moreover, the increase of the number of
   devices within the airport infrastructure system leads to a tremendous
   demand of computational assistance systems for operations management. As
   most devices within the airport are directly connected to processes,
   there is a high demand for identifying and managing system failures
   immediately and increase the system resilience. Thus, we introduce
   process-oriented-grouping of network devices and use linear algebra to
   relate the impact of system state changes to airport processes, such as
   check-in, security checks et cetera. This connection between system
   state and processes is inevitable for a successful combination of
   computational approaches to determine physical state variations, induced
   by power grid instabilities and/or cyber-attacks, and process oriented
   simulation methods. Matrix relations between system states, process
   capacities, waiting times are given and applied to a small, at this
   state fictional airport infrastructure. This application shows that
   forecasting of quantitative values for airport processes is a beneficial
   tool for airport infrastructure management. Moreover, linear algebra
   properties prove to be a strong tool in analyzing network properties,
   such as infrastructure diversity and process capacities, which play a
   major role within resource management. However, at the moment our
   approach is only suitable as a supporting tool for human decision
   making. Nevertheless the approach can be enhanced as intelligent health
   monitoring system for airports.},

Abstract = {Reactor Pressure Vessel (hereinafter RPV) is the core component of PWR
   nuclear power plants. The nuclear power plants operation experience
   shows that the dangerous defects could produce in the material of Bottom
   Mounted Instrument and J type weld(hereinafter BMI). In early nuclear
   power plants, the BMI is made of corrosion-sensitive materials (such as
   Alloy 600). The stress corrosion crack is easy to grow up and destroy
   the integrity of RPV in operation. Therefore, inspection for BMI during
   the service stage is necessary to ensure the integrity of the primary
   circuit pressure boundary.
   The BMI is general made of Alloy 600 or Alloy 690 and penetrate the
   reactor pressure vessel lower head vertically to form J type weld on the
   inner wall of the RPV lower head. The inner diameter is generally 15 to
   16 mm and the wall thickness is about 15 mm. In order to improve the
   welding performance, the dissimilar metal J-type weld groove is usually
   overlaid with nickel-based pre-heap edge. The component structural and
   material characteristics have brought great difficulties to the test
   technology research as well as the location.
   In this paper, the main failure modes of BMI are introduced and the
   technical requirements of in-service inspections are presented. The
   technical scheme and inspection system are designed according to the
   above requirements and weld structural characteristics. Both UT and ET
   methods are used for the inspection. UT is based on the time of flight
   diffraction (hereinafter TOFD) technique. According to the structural
   and material characteristics of the BMI, many researches have been done
   on block with simulated defect, and characteristic rule of defect
   indication signals in different areas are summarized. Then, the optimal
   design parameters of the TOFD probe are gained and the disadvantages of
   ultrasonic inspection are overcome. The eddy current inspection system
   adopts the inspection technology with the Bobbin probe and the rotary
   point probe combined together. The use of its surface and near the
   surface of the detection ability has become a powerful complement to
   ultrasonic testing. From the test result, TOFD probe has high defect
   height measurement accuracy. Measurement error isn't more than 1mm and
   mostly is positive deviation. The surface defects with a height of not
   less than 2 mm can be measured.
   Considering the complex geometry of BMI, the multi mode multi-axis
   scanning program and remote automatic docking device are used in the
   system. The multi-mode multi axis scanning program can be achieved axial
   and circumferential rotation of the probe with the axial positioning
   accuracy within 2mm and circumferential positioning accuracy within 3
   degrees. The remote automatic docking device can be used to connect the
   bottom of the mechanical device and the top of the BMI in fast and
   seamless security to avoid the mechanical device bumping of the
   component. The probe connecting shaft is made of flexible material,
   which avoids the violent bumping of the tested parts and greatly
   enhances the safety of the equipment operation. The system simulates the
   actual scanning environment by establishing three-dimensional model and
   testing it on the simulation body.},

Abstract = {Reliable and timely information on agricultural production is essential
   for ensuring world food security. Freely available medium-resolution
   satellite data (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel) offer the possibility of
   improved global agriculture monitoring. Here we develop and test a
   method for estimating in-season crop acreage using a probability sample
   of field visits and producing wall-to-wall crop type maps at national
   scales. The method is illustrated for soybean cultivated area in the US
   for 2015. A stratified, two-stage cluster sampling design was used to
   collect field data to estimate national soybean area. The field-based
   estimate employed historical soybean extent maps from the U.S.
   Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer to delineate and
   stratify U.S. soybean growing regions. The estimated 2015 U.S. soybean
   cultivated area based on the field sample was 341,000 km(2) with a
   standard error of 23,000 km2. This result is 1.0\% lower than USDA's
   2015 June survey estimate and 1.9\% higher than USDA's 2016 January
   estimate. Our area estimate was derived in early September, about 2
   months ahead of harvest. To map soybean cover, the Landsat image archive
   for the year 2015 growing season was processed using an active learning
   approach. Overall accuracy of the soybean map was 84\%. The field-based
   sample estimated area was then used to calibrate the map such that the
   soybean acreage of the map derived through pixel counting matched the
   sample -based area estimate. The strength of the sample -based area
   estimation lies in the stratified design that takes advantage of the
   spatially explicit cropland layers to construct the strata. The success
   of the mapping was built upon an automated system which transforms
   Landsat images into standardized time-series metrics. The developed
   method produces reliable and timely information on soybean area in a
   cost-effective way and could be applied to other regions and potentially
   other crops in an operational mode. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Security of a data framework is its significant property, particularly
   today, when PCs are interconnected by means of web. Since no framework
   can be completely secure, the opportune and precise recognition of
   interruptions is essential. For this reason, intrusion detection systems
   (IDS) were planned. An interruption identification framework's principle
   aspiration is to sort exercises of a framework into two key classes:
   standard and suspicious exercises. Most IDS business devices are abuse
   frameworkswith principle-based master framework structure. Be that as it
   may, these strategies are less effective when assault qualities shift
   from inherent marks. In such manner, a scope of pre-preparing practices,
   for example, information mining, neural systems, Petri nets, state
   change outlines, hereditary calculations, choice trees and fluffy-based
   rationales is worked out. In this paper, we have considered distinctive
   fluffy methodologies for interruption identification framework utilizing
   fuzzy set hypothesis, and we dissect fuzzy standard, expressly for
   peculiarity-based assault finding. For structure inconsistency
   framework, neural systems likewise can be utilized, on the grounds that
   they can figure out how to segregate the ordinary and anomalous conduct
   of a framework from models. Along these lines, they offer a promising
   strategy for structure oddity frameworks. Fake neural systems give the
   possibility to recognize and arrange organized action dependent on
   constrained, fragmented and nonlinear information sources. We have
   completed a similar report between two delicate registering procedures
   utilization of fluffy in the event that principles versus use of the
   feed forward neural network prepared by back-propagation calculation for
   interruption location. Reenactment result demonstrates that the feed
   forward neural network prepared by back-propagation calculation for
   interruption location yields better outcome which distinguishes the
   interruptions precisely and is well reasonable for constant applications

Abstract = {Aerial radiological search and survey missions have been performed by
   the United States Department of Energy's (USDOE) Remote Sensing
   Laboratory for over 40 years. Originally created in 1967 as Aerial
   Measurement Operations, the Aerial Measuring System ( AMS) mission has
   expanded to include acquiring baseline measurements, performing periodic
   site monitoring, and responding to radiological emergencies. In an
   accident scenario, AMS fixedwing and/or rotary-wing systems can be
   deployed to map radiological deposition. The aircraft are equipped to
   detect and measure radioactive contamination on the ground. The AMS has
   a sophisticated radiation detection system to gather radiological
   information and store it on the cloud using the Advanced Visualization
   and Integration of Data (AVID) platform or on local computers. This
   large amount of radiation monitoring data is later used to define and
   implement public protective guidance.
   Aerial radiation measurements have proven to be very effective in
   support of responses to nuclear or radiological emergencies resulting in
   the dispersal of radioactive material over a large area {[}viz.
   Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear power plant measurements done through March
   and April 2011] {[}1]. Right after the Fukushima accident, US aerial
   missions flew 85 flights over 500 hours, covering more than 10,000
   square kilometres from the power plant to an 80 km radius to create a
   common operating picture of the extent of the gamma-emitting
   radionuclides and the footprint of the deposition from multiple
   releases.
   In order to be effective, the aerial measurements must be performed with
   a system that will collect the data in sufficient detail and quality to
   support the needs of emergency responders. This paper briefly outlines
   the technical specifications and functions of a system to be used on an
   aerial platform (airplane or helicopter) to measure widespread
   radioactive material (radioactive contamination). The information
   contained within this paper is intended to help ensure that measurements
   conducted by multiple AMSs are both technically compatible and
   comparable with each other and with measurements taken on the ground.
   Recently AMS has acquired newer and faster aircraft with
   longer-than-before ranges to deploy radiation monitoring equipment. This
   article defines and provides guidance for using the US DOE/NNSA's new
   aerial measurement platforms with multi-fold return of the investment in
   mind. The guidance involves technical innovation and optimized use of
   the platforms and collaboration with other stakeholders like the
   Department of Homeland Security, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and
   the Environmental Protection Agency. The guidance recommends AMS to
   reposition itself as a valid and credentialed data provider to other
   relevant and recognized stakeholders in the area of chemical,
   biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives threats. It recommends
   critical application expansion for AVID to analyse multi-modal data
   including hyperspectral, infrared, and radiological data through data
   fusion.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to identify a set of crucial indicators to
   assess the most pressing environmental impacts of diets.
   Based on a literature review, 55 potential assessment methods were
   selected and their distinctive indicators identified. The methods were
   classified according to their position in the DPSIR framework {[}chain
   of Drivers, Pressures, State (changes), Impacts, and Responses], and
   into 15 environmental issues at three levels. The selection was narrowed
   down to eight, based on the availability of reliable methods, their
   relevance to agri-food systems, their frequent application for diets,
   and their recommendation by international bodies.
   (1) At the global (supra) level, the planetary boundaries approach
   addresses the current global environmental (change in) state and helps
   to prioritize the most pressing issues related to the agri-food system
   as a driver. These issues are climate change, nitrogen and phosphorus
   cycle disruption, land-use change, and freshwater use. (2) At the
   national (macro) level, the footprints approach is used to identify
   indicators. This footprint family includes ecological, land, carbon,
   energy, and water footprints. International bodies support these key
   indicators, but they recommend complementary assessment methods for
   nitrogen and phosphorus flows, soil health, and pesticide use. (3) At
   the product (micro) level, life cycle assessment includes 11 pressure
   indicators. Of the latter, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) and land use
   (LU) are the most frequently used indicators in diet studies.
   We conclude that GHGEs and LU fulfill the selection criteria and address
   most of the environmental impact of diets well. In the future, these
   indicators should be supplemented with an indicator addressing the
   nitrogen and phosphorous efficiency of food products.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT},

Abstract = {The first IFIP/IEEE international workshop on Managing Federations and
   Cooperative Management (ManFed.CoM) took place in conjunction with the
   IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM
   2011) conference in Trinity College Dublin, Ireland on May 23rd 2011.
   The multi-mode, loosely coupled, user-centric nature of modern
   communications and services, coupled with the diversity of operator
   business models, ensure that modern end-to-end service provision
   frequently crosses heterogeneous management and administrative domains.
   Thus, management approaches that can be applied across organizational
   boundaries are increasingly important in a wide range of application
   areas. There are a number of significant, common, complex issues which
   must be addressed in all technologies and applications that involve
   federated organizations, yet research has heretofore been mostly
   confined to particular technical or application areas. The first
   installment of ManFed.Com addressed this gap by bringing together
   researchers from a broad array of application and technical areas who
   shared an interest in cross-domain management. The workshop drew out
   common themes, problems and issues encountered, and the solutions being
   designed to deal with the problems of managing information systems that
   span autonomous domains. More than 30 researchers participated in a
   lively and interactive day of paper presentation, panels and software
   demonstrations. The success of the inaugural event was such that the
   organizing committee is now committed to running further
   installations-we are in the process of preparing a submission to run a
   the 2nd ManFed.CoM in conjunction with the IEEE/IFIP Network Operations
   and Management Symposium (NOMS) 2012 conference. We believe that these
   workshops will help to provide the basis for a common understanding and
   common approaches to inter-domain management and governance that
   synthesizes the insights and best-of-breed solutions being developed in
   the diverse areas in which these problems are encountered. The technical
   program of ManFed.CoM 2011 was organized as a single track and was
   composed of two panels of invited experts, two full paper sessions, one
   short paper session and a demonstration session in which practical
   software tools were presented. Of the 16 papers submitted, 6 were
   selected for presentation as full papers, with a further 3 being
   presented in condensed form as short papers. All the papers submitted
   underwent a rigorous review process, receiving between 2 and 5 reviews
   each, with the accepted full papers receiving a minimum score of 7.5 out
   of 10 from reviewers. The papers presented constituted a good
   cross-section of current cross-domain management research work-they
   covered modeling, semantic interoperability, trust management and
   security, policy based management, business process orchestration,
   collaboration and delegation and look at management on a number of
   different layers-from low level network management, all the way up to
   high level business-driven management.},

Abstract = {Computer networks and surging advancements of innovative information
   technology construct a critical infrastructure for network transactions
   of business entities. Information exchange and data access though such
   infrastructure is scrutinized by adversaries for vulnerabilities that
   lead to cyber-attacks. This paper presents an agent-based system
   modelling to conceptualize and extract explicit and latent structure of
   the complex enterprise systems as well as human interactions within the
   system to determine common vulnerabilities of the entity. The model
   captures emergent behavior resulting from interactions of multiple
   network agents including the number of workstations, regular,
   administrator and third-party users, external and internal attacks,
   defense mechanisms for the network setting, and many other parameters. A
   risk-based approach to modelling cybersecurity of a business entity is
   utilized to derive the rate of attacks. A neural network model will
   generalize the type of attack based on network traffic features allowing
   dynamic state changes. Rules of engagement to generate self-organizing
   behavior will be leveraged to appoint a defense mechanism suitable for
   the attack-state of the model. The effectiveness of the model will be
   depicted by time-state chart that shows the number of affected assets
   for the different types of attacks triggered by the entity risk and the
   time it takes to revert into normal state. The model will also associate
   a relevant cost per incident occurrence that derives the need for
   enhancement of security solutions.},

Abstract = {Recent architectural approaches that address speculative side-channel
   attacks aim to prevent software from exposing the microarchitectural
   state changes of transient execution. The Delay-on-Miss technique is one
   such approach, which simply delays loads that miss in the L1 cache until
   they become non-speculative, resulting in no transient changes in the
   memory hierarchy. However, this costs performance, prompting the use of
   value prediction (VP) to regain some of the delay.
   However, the problem cannot be solved by simply introducing a new kind
   of speculation (value prediction). Value-predicted loads have to be
   validated, which cannot be commenced until the load becomes
   nonspeculative. Thus, value-predicted loads occupy the same amount of
   precious core resources (e.g., reorder buffer entries) as Delay-on-Miss.
   The end result is that VP only yields marginal benefits over
   Delay-on-Miss.
   In this paper, our insight is that we can achieve the same goal as VP
   (increasing performance by providing the value of loads that miss)
   without incurring its negative side-effect (delaying the release of
   precious resources), if we can safely, non-speculatively, recompute a
   value in isolation (without being seen from the outside), so that we do
   not expose any information by transferring such a value via the memory
   hierarchy. Value Recomputation, which trades computation for data
   transfer was previously proposed in an entirely different context: to
   reduce energy-expensive data transfers in the memory hierarchy. In this
   paper, we demonstrate the potential of value recomputation in relation
   to the Delay-on-Miss approach of hiding speculation, discuss the
   trade-offs, and show that we can achieve the same level of security,
   reaching 93\% of the unsecured baseline performance (5\% higher than
   Delay-on-miss), and exceeding (by 3\%) what even an oracular (100\%
   accuracy and coverage) value predictor could do.},

Abstract = {In 2007 and 2008 ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana/Italian Space Agency)
   launched three out of four X-band SAR satellites of the COSMO-SkyMed
   (COnstellation of small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation)
   constellation, making available to the users a unique SAR constellation
   dedicated to the Earth Observation.
   The constellation will be completed with the launch of the fourth
   satellite in 2010.
   COSMO-SkyMed is the largest Italian investment in Space Systems for
   Earth Observation, commissioned and funded by Italian Space Agency (ASI)
   and Italian Ministry of Defense (MoD). COSMO-SkyMed is a Dual-Use
   (Civilian and Defence) end-to-end Earth Observation System aimed to
   establish a global service supplying provision of data, products and
   services relevant to a wide range of applications, such as Risk
   Management, Scientific and Commercial Applications and
   Defence/Intelligence Applications.
   The system consists of a constellation of four Low Earth Orbit mid-sized
   satellites, each equipped with a multi-mode high-resolution Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (SAR) operating at X-band. The system is completed by
   dedicated full featured Ground infrastructures for managing the
   constellation and granting ad-hoc services for collection, archiving and
   distribution of acquired remote sensing data.
   The first and second COSMO-SkyMed satellites are in the operational
   phase while the third one is completing its commissioning phase.
   The results coming from the utilisation of the two first satellites,
   after the first year of life, revealing an excellent performance of the
   X-band SAR and the importance of a fast response time in several
   application as risk and emergency management (i.e., China's earthquake,
   Myanmar and Haiti flood), ice monitoring (reduction of the glaciers,
   Wilkins Ice Shelf disintegration), multi-temporal acquisition for
   agriculture monitoring, ship detection, interferometry, landslides
   monitoring, maritime surveillance and security, rapid mapping.
   A further step forward will be realized when COSMO-SkyMed 3 will be
   operative, since the third satellite is positioned in the so-called
   ``one-day interferometry configuration{''}, it will allow the
   constellation to detect interferometric acquisitions with a
   de-correlation time equal to one day.
   The first COSMO-SkyMed Announcement of Opportunity for scientific data
   exploitation will give the chance to achieve innovative and valuable
   results using the COSMO-SkyMed data, products and services.},

Abstract = {In the digital world, secure data communication has an important role in
   mass media and Internet technology. With the increase in modern
   malicious technologies, confidential data are exposed at a greater risk
   during data communication. For secured communication, recent
   technologies and the Internet have introduced steganography, a new way
   to hide data. Steganography is the growing practice of concealing data
   in multimedia files for secure data transfer. Nowadays, videos are more
   commonly chosen as cover media than other multimedia files because of
   the moving sequence of images and audio files. Despite its popularity,
   video steganography faces a significant challenge, which is a lack of a
   fast retrieval system of the hidden data. This study proposes a novel
   video steganography technique in which an enhanced hidden Markov model
   (EHMM) is employed to improve the speed of retrieving hidden data. EHMM
   mathematical formulations are used to enhance the speed of embedding and
   extracting secret data. The data embedding and retrieving operations
   were performed using the conditional states and the state transition
   dynamics between the video frames. The proposed EHMM is extensively
   evaluated using three benchmark functions, and experimental evaluations
   are conducted to test the speed of data retrieval using differently
   sized cover-videos. Results indicate that the proposed EHMM yields
   better results by reducing the data hiding time by 3-50\%, improving the
   data retrieval rate by 22-77\% with a minimum computational cost of
   20-91\%, and improving the security by 4-77\% compared with
   state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {During the last years, because of the evolution of Cloud applications
   and the attractive advantages given to consumers, many companies
   outsource their data and Information Technology (IT) system to the Cloud
   based technology. With the growth in the number of Cloud Service
   Providers, many enterprises and organizations can use and associate
   services from multiple providers. There may be many Internet protocols
   for service access standards that are used to ensure interoperability
   between users browser and Web server, such as Representational State
   Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Each service
   has its specific characteristics such as authentication and security
   requirements. Hence, Cloud providers attempt to lock customers into
   proprietary interfaces so consumers can find themselves at not expects
   inevitable vendor lock-in. Therefore, the focus of our paper is to
   propose a solution to this problem by using Cloud intermediate between
   Cloud providers and consumer in heterogeneous Cloud environments
   interfaces. This is to achieve benefits such as standardization and
   interoperability, minimizing lock-in of Cloud providers. To reach such
   benefits, we propose a Cloud SaaS based on two interfaces and an interne
   component. These interfaces are used in Cloud Consumer and Provider
   sides and therefore guarantee communication between Cloud Consumer and
   Provider using different Internet protocols for Web service access such
   as REST and SOAP. Our approach guarantees interoperability and
   standardization in heterogeneous Cloud based environments because in
   this case Cloud Consumer and Provider using REST interface can
   communicate easily with Cloud Provider and Consumer using SOAP
   interface.},

Abstract = {For a modern vehicle, if a sensor in the vehicle Anti-lock Braking
   System (ABS) or the controller area network (CAN) bus is attacked during
   a brake process, the vehicle will lose driving direction control and
   driver's life will be highly threatened. However, current methods for
   detecting attacks are not sufficiently accurate and no methods can
   provide attack mitigation. To ensure vehicle ABS security, we propose an
   attack detection method to accurately detect both sensor attack and CAN
   bus attack in a vehicle ABS, and an attack mitigation strategy to
   mitigate their negative effects on the vehicle ABS. In our attack
   detection method, we build a vehicle state space equation which
   considers-time road friction coefficient to predict vehicle states
   (i.e., wheel speed and longitudinal brake force) with their previous
   values. Based on sets of historical measured vehicle states, we develop
   a search algorithm to find out attack changes (vehicle state changes
   because of the attack) by minimizing errors between predicted vehicle
   states and measured vehicle states. In our attack mitigation strategy,
   attack changes are subtracted from measured vehicle states to generate
   correct vehicle states for the vehicle ABS. We conducted first real
   sensor attack experiments to show how a magnet affects sensor readings.
   Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack detection method
   can detect sensor attack and CAN bus attack more accurately compared
   with existing methods, and also our attack mitigation strategy ost
   eliminates attack's effects on the vehicle ABS.},

Title = {A novel branch-based power flow algorithm for islanded AC microgrids},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {146},
Pages = {51-62},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Interest in microgrids is reaching the viral level, fed by the growing
   research attention and industry investment they are attracting. With its
   ingrained islanding capability, a microgrid can operate in isolation
   from the main grid while still keeping its load supplied for enhanced
   reliability and supply security. These microgrids represent the building
   block for future smart distribution systems. For steady-state studies of
   this type of isolated operating mode, an accurate, fast, scalable,
   efficient power flow analysis tool is crucial. Conventional power flow
   analysis face challenges when applied to isolated microgrids such as
   singularity results from system radiality, high R/X ratio, relatively
   small rated distributed generation (DG) units and thus absence of
   conventional slack bus, extensive computational burden, convergence
   issues and extensive solution time. Although branch-based power flow
   techniques are more preferred for distribution systems to overcome some
   of the aforementioned challenges, these techniques are incompatible with
   isolated microgrids as they necessitate the availability of a slack bus.
   This paper presents a novel branch-based methodology based on the use of
   power sweeps to solve the steady-state power flow problem. The proposed
   forward-return-forward-backward sweep (FR-FBS) includes Consideration of
   inherent isolated microgrid characteristics, such as its variable
   frequency and the absence of a slack bus. The proposed approach also
   incorporates practical operating mddes for DG units and a variety of
   load characteristics. In addition, the inversion-fred nature and
   consequent speed of the algorithm avoid excessive computational time,
   thus making it suitable for large distribution networks. The proposed
   algorithm has been applied to test systems and the obtained results were
   compared to those obtained with time-domain simulations as well as
   newton trusted region load flow method. In addition, the effect of load
   changing on micrgrid's voltage profile and power sharing among different
   DGs were studied. The results show the accuracy and effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm. This tool therefore offers support for online energy
   management, self-healing applications, and emerging techniques for
   clustering power systems into adaptive self-adequate microgrids. (C)

Abstract = {The scope and applicability of detecting gamma-emitting materials by
   first responders and advanced searchers have changed considerably over
   the last 15 years. More often than not the searchers are being asked to
   obtain an image of the gamma sources that are shielded or otherwise
   inaccessible. They are constantly being tasked to localize a moving
   source in busy traffic. Commercially available gamma detection units and
   prototype Government-funded research products use complex techniques
   such as hybrid imaging processes (combination of traditional Compton
   imaging with coded aperture masks, for example, modified uniformly
   redundant array {[}MURA] patterns). Standalone radiation detection
   systems are increasingly capitalizing on multi-modal detection,
   emphasizing on data fusion, informatics, and novel signal/signature
   exploitations.
   At the request of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
   Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office, previously known
   as the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), a study committee from
   the American Physical Society has recommended that emphasis is kept on
   the ability to detect shielded special nuclear material with high
   sensitivity and reliability. Development of new and improved detection
   algorithms ( e.g., principal component analysis, maximum-likelihood
   estimation algorithm, and others) has been encouraged. CWMD has been
   urged to focus on signature identification in its nuclear forensic
   portfolio. Newer materials like SrI3:Eu2+, LaBr3:Ce, CeBr3:Ca2+ with
   fast rise time and short decay time of gamma pulses, high intrinsic
   gamma sensitivity, high gamma energy resolution, and high-efficiency
   conversion of excitation energy to fluorescent radiation are constantly
   being sought to build gamma detectors. Neutron detection and associated
   activation analysis using a gamma ray detection system is highly
   encouraged.
   There is a constant demand for miniaturization of gamma radiation
   detection system for tactical usage in the field- the most sought-after
   device must be lightweight, easy to use, should be able to withstand
   harsh environmental conditions, long shelf life with commensurate long
   battery life, high sensitivity (with preferably high resolution),
   capable of creating flexible and configurable alarm conditions with
   directional sensitivity. This array of technical constraints demands
   stringent specifications on the readout electronics, data acquisition
   technologies, interoperability and interconnectivity of data output and
   strict quality assurance of the detection and measurement devices.
   In recent years the CWMD has developed a system called Intelligent
   Radiation Sensing System (IRSS) that harnesses the information gathered
   by ubiquitous radiation monitoring systems deployed by the state, local,
   and tribal law enforcement organizers {[}1]. The IRSS was created to
   better equip law enforcement entities to protect large cities from the
   threats and harmful effects of nuclear or radiological incidents and
   emergencies. The IRSS uses a breakthrough technology that networks a
   group of portable radiation detectors with improved detection,
   localization, and identification of potential radiological threat. The
   program created a robust, flexible network architecture along with
   advanced data fusion algorithms that combine information from many
   detectors.
   A study {[}2] published in the Journal of Materials Research summarized
   the basic requirements for materials to be used in development of
   scalable radiation detection systems that considered the critical
   material performance metrics of energy resolution (1\% for
   semiconductors like CZT, <3\% for scintillators like LaBr3:Ce at 662 keV
   primary gamma ray energy from Cs-137 isotope), fast timing including
   high mobility of electrons and holes in the semiconductors and fast
   scintillation processes, high spatial resolution for imaging purposes,
   high intrinsic detection efficiency (requiring high density, high
   effective atomic number Z(eff)), high geometric efficiency achieved
   sometimes by occlusion processes, neutron detection efficiency and
   operational factors like cost, ease of use, use of peripheral equipment
   like thermomechanical engines to stabilize the detection systems.
   Exciting new research and development work utilizing effective data
   mining algorithms is being performed at universities, national
   laboratories, and commercial institutions in gamma ray detection
   technology. For example, gamma ray imaging techniques first used in
   space telescopes are being applied in modern security and health systems
   in a joint project between the University of Southampton and industrial
   partner Symetrica. The project aims to develop a new coded aperture
   imaging system that could inspire a new generation of ``stand-off{''}
   imaging systems. These systems would allow for remote inspection for
   radioactive materials.
   This review article intends to capture the synergy of international
   commercial collaborations exemplified by the United States Defense
   Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA's) SIGMA program in which
   detector expertise originating from the United Kingdom (Kromek Group
   plc.) algorithm development and system modelling and analysis developed
   by United States national laboratories came together under the general
   guidance provided by a small commercial unit, Invincea Labs, in the area
   of network algorithm integration and development.},

Title = {ACTION-EHR: Patient-Centric Blockchain-Based Electronic Health Record
   Data Management for Cancer Care},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Background: With increased specialization of health care services and
   high levels of patient mobility, accessing health care services across
   multiple hospitals or clinics has become very common for diagnosis and
   treatment, particularly for patients with chronic diseases such as
   cancer. With informed knowledge of a patient's history, physicians can
   make prompt clinical decisions for smarter, safer, and more efficient
   care. However, due to the privacy and high sensitivity of electronic
   health records (EHR), most EHR data sharing still happens through fax or
   mail due to the lack of systematic infrastructure support for secure,
   trustable health data sharing, which can also cause major delays in
   patient care.
   Objective: Our goal was to develop a system that will facilitate secure,
   trustable management, sharing, and aggregation of EHR data. Our
   patient-centric system allows patients to manage their own health
   records across multiple hospitals. The system will ensure patient
   privacy protection and guarantee security with respect to the
   requirements for health care data management, including the access
   control policy specified by the patient.
   Methods: We propose a permissioned blockchain-based system for EHR data
   sharing and integration. Each hospital will provide a blockchain node
   integrated with its own EHR system to form the blockchain network. A
   web-based interface will be used for patients and doctors to initiate
   EHR sharing transactions. We take a hybrid data management approach,
   where only management metadata will be stored on the chain Actual EHR
   data, on the other hand, will be encrypted and stored off-chain in
   Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant
   cloud-based storage. The system uses public key infrastructure-based
   asymmetric encryption and digital signatures to secure shared EHR data.
   Results: In collaboration with Stony Brook University Hospital, we
   developed ACTION-EHR, a system for patient-centric, blockchain-based EHR
   data sharing and management for patient care, in particular radiation
   treatment for cancer. The prototype was built on Hyperledger Fabric, an
   open-source, permissioned blockchain framework. Data sharing
   transactions were implemented using chaincode and exposed as
   representational state transfer application programming interfaces used
   for the web portal for patients and users. The HL7 Fast Healthcare
   Interoperability Resources standard was adopted to represent shared EHR
   data, making it easy to interface with hospital EHR systems and
   integrate a patient's EHR data. We tested the system in a distributed
   environment at Stony Brook University using deidentified patient data.
   Conclusions: We studied and developed the critical technology components
   to enable patient-centric, blockchain-based EHR sharing to support
   cancer care. The prototype demonstrated the feasibility of our approach
   as well as some of the major challenges. The next step will be a pilot
   study with health care providers in both the United States and
   Switzerland. Our work provides an exemplar testbed to build
   next-generation EHR sharing infrastructures.},

Abstract = {The primary memory of the computer gets corrupted due to microparticles
   that possess a great deal of energy. This causes transient kind of
   errors and it is called subtle errors. High corruption of data in
   computer systems has been occurred because of these errors. Major
   sources of subtle errors include ionic particles, huge radiations say
   example alpha, beta and gamma rays, protons, neutrons etc., When TCAM
   configuration changes from 120 nm to 20 nm technology, there was a
   drastic increase in subtle errors more than multiples of eight. Devices
   operated in low power regions are more prone to subtle errors. Memory
   storage devices like secondary memory element called cache, registers
   are more feasible to subtle errors.(1) Behavior of subtle errors never
   damage circuit configuration but changes the information content leading
   to erroneous data. The proposed architecture is called N-SEARCH KEY
   TCAM, where in this system, it has been predicted that occurrence of
   subtle errors are very small. This innovative method of detecting and
   correcting both single and burst type of subtle errors has many modules
   like TCAM, Multiplexer, control circuit and Error correction code frame.
   Moreover, the proposed architecture N-SEARCH KEY ternary memory uses a
   special LUT for matching process. A key named Search key was generated
   which contains don't care bits for matching subtle errors. Unlike
   regular TCAM, this design uses sequential LUT which enhances matching
   time of order O(wnlog2n). Initially, proposed scheme have been used to
   find single bit subtle errors by changing forbearance factor (F) and
   chances of occurrence of error among TCAM information. The design was
   enhanced to detect multiple subtle errors and rectified the same. If
   match not occurs with predetermined information, then IP filter forbids
   the unauthorized users from using global network resources, thus
   providing better information security. By the proposed method, number of
   improper segregation ratio decreases with increase in Forbearance ratio
   parameter and time required to detect and correct the same is also
   considerably reduced. By controlling the forbearance factor F, the best
   duration schemes can be chosen. Through the given architecture, average
   time consumption for error checking of subtle errors would range from
   0.6 to 0.7 mu s.},

Title = {Quantification label for mobile apps},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {124-138},
Abstract = {Nowadays every product we purchase has a tag informing its users how
   much an automobile or an appliance will cost to run and how much energy
   a food product will provide on consumption, for example. With the advent
   of Internet, purchasing Apps becomes habitual, as Apps facilitate easy
   way of trading and generate money according to App online stores.
   Currently, Apps provide label that contains a combination of developer
   info, memory size, category, operating system compatibility, user
   ratings and reviews, and privacy policy. However, the product label
   information is asymmetrical and it varies with the developer. It is
   challenging to develop common standards explicit to users, as their
   needs are dynamic; moreover, the App undergoes a series of state changes
   during execution, according to the usage pattern. We propose a
   quantification label framework to assess the mobile/web App using a set
   of quantifiers, such as functionality, degree and domain of
   connectivity, battery consumption, and its vulnerability index for
   generating a set of standard labels. The corresponding labels in the
   label frame are: features, popularity, energy consumption and security.
   Further, we utilized principal component analysis (PCA), a statistical
   technique to assist the customers in selecting the prominent features
   from the dataset and to compare related apps, which analyzes the
   quantifiers in the given datasets and distinguish them according to the
   variances. The experimental results in quantifying a real time traffic
   data of an internet based App validated the proposed label by revealing
   the key features to the users; moreover, PCA carried out on four sets of
   traffic data enabled the selection of prominent data, and the results
   also revealed the possible embedding of the framework within an App for
   dynamic monitoring.},

Title = {Evaluating the impacts of new walking and cycling infrastructure on
   carbon dioxide emissions from motorized travel: A controlled
   longitudinal study},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {284-295},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Walking and cycling is widely assumed to substitute for at least some
   motorized travel and thereby reduce energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions. While the evidence suggests that a supportive built
   environment may be needed to promote walking and cycling, it is unclear
   whether and how interventions in the built environment that attract
   walkers and cyclists may reduce transport CO2 emissions. Our aim was
   therefore to evaluate the effects of providing new infrastructure for
   walking and cycling on CO2 emissions from motorized travel.
   A cohort of 1849 adults completed questionnaires at baseline (2010) and
   one-year follow-up (2011), before and after the construction of new
   high-quality routes provided as part of the Sustrans Connect2 programme
   in three UK municipalities. A second cohort of 1510 adults completed
   questionnaires at baseline and two-year follow-up (2012). The
   participants reported their past-week travel behaviour and car
   characteristics from which CO2 emissions by mode and purpose were
   derived using methods described previously. A set of exposure measures
   of proximity to and use of the new routes were derived.
   Overall transport CO2 emissions decreased slightly over the study
   period, consistent with a secular trend in the case study regions. As
   found previously the new infrastructure was well used at one- and
   two-year follow-up, and was associated with population-level increases
   in walking, cycling and physical activity at two-year follow-up.
   However, these effects did not translate into sizeable CO2 effects as
   neither living near the infrastructure nor using it predicted changes in
   CO2 emissions from motorized travel, either overall or disaggregated by
   journey purpose. This lack of a discernible effect on travel CO2
   emissions are consistent with an interpretation that some of those
   living nearer the infrastructure may simply have changed where they
   walked or cycled, while others may have walked or cycled more but few,
   if any, may have substituted active for motorized modes of travel as a
   result of the interventions. While the findings to date cannot exclude
   the possibility of small effects of the new routes on CO2 emissions, a
   more comprehensive approach of a higher `dosage' of active travel
   promotion linked with policies targeted at mode shift away from private
   motorized transport (such as urban car restraint and parking pricing,
   car sharing/pooling for travel to work, integrating bike sharing into
   public transport system) may be needed to achieve the substantial CO2
   savings needed to meet climate change mitigation and energy security
   goals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
