Title = {A model-based mode-switching framework based on security vulnerability
   scores},

Abstract = {Software vulnerabilities can affect critical systems within an
   organization impacting processes, work-flows, privacy, and safety. When
   a software vulnerability becomes known, affected systems are at risk
   until appropriate updates become available and eventually deployed. This
   period can last from a few days to several months, during which
   attackers can develop exploits and take advantage of the vulnerability.
   It is tedious and time-consuming to keep track of vulnerabilities
   manually and perform necessary actions to shut down, update, or modify
   systems. Vulnerabilities affect system components, such as a web server,
   but sometimes only target specific versions or component combinations.In
   this paper, we propose a novel approach for automated mode switching of
   software systems to support system administrators in dealing with
   vulnerabilities and reducing the risk of exposure. We rely on
   model-driven techniques and use a multi-modal architecture to react to
   discovered vulnerabilities and provide automated contingency support. We
   have developed a dedicated domain-specific language to describe
   potential mitigation as mode switches. We have evaluated our approach
   with a web server case study, analyzing historical vulnerability data.
   Based on the vulnerabilities scores sum, we demonstrated that switching
   to less vulnerable modes reduced the attack surface in 98.9\% of the
   analyzed time.Editor's note: Open Science material was validated by the

Abstract = {Power system topology control as a planned corrective action in face of
   contingencies and also as a measure for achieving economic gains in real
   time market operation has been recently studied as an enhancement in
   hour- and day-ahead operations. Although attractive from the reliability
   and economic standpoint, the attention must be paid to the impact on the
   power system operating states following the switching implementation to
   make sure the system security performance in the new migrated operating
   state is not jeopardized. This paper suggests a probabilistic measure to
   foresee the likelihood of experiencing undesirable operating state
   following execution of an optimal hour- ahead switching plan. The
   presented approach can also be helpful in selecting the most practical
   switching action when the optimization engine can provide multiple
   optimal switching scenarios. The proposed tool is tested on a modified
   IEEE 118-Bus Test System to demonstrate its applicability and
   effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Adaptive security systems aim to protect valuable assets in the face of
   changes in their operational environment. They do so by monitoring and
   analysing this environment, and deploying security functions that
   satisfy some protection (security, privacy, or forensic) requirements.
   In this paper, we suggest that a key characteristic for engineering
   adaptive security is the topology of the operational environment, which
   represents a physical and/or a digital space - including its structural
   relationships, such as containment, proximity, and reachability. For
   adaptive security, topology expresses a rich representation of context
   that can provide a system with both structural and semantic awareness of
   important contextual characteristics. These include the location of
   assets being protected or the proximity of potentially threatening
   agents that might harm them. Security-related actions, such as the
   physical movement of an actor from a room to another in a building, may
   be viewed as topological changes. The detection of a possible undesired
   topological change (such as an actor possessing a safe's key entering
   the room where the safe is located) may lead to the decision to deploy a
   particular security control to protect the relevant asset. This position
   paper advocates topology awareness for more effective engineering of
   adaptive security. By monitoring changes in topology at runtime one can
   identify new or changing threats and attacks, and deploy adequate
   security controls accordingly. The paper elaborates on the notion of
   topology and provides a vision and research agenda on its role for
   systematically engineering adaptive security systems.},

Title = {Revocable hierarchical identity-based encryption with adaptive security},
Journal = {THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE},

Volume = {880},
Pages = {37-68},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {Hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) can be extended to
   revocable HIBE (RHIBE) if a private key of a user can be revoked when
   the private key is revealed or expired. Previously, many selectively
   secure RHIBE schemes were proposed, but it is still unsolved problem to
   construct an adaptively secure RHIBE scheme. In this work, we propose
   two RHIBE schemes in composite-order bilinear groups and prove their
   adaptive security under simple static assumptions. To prove the adaptive
   security, we use the dual system encryption framework, but it is not
   simple to use the dual system encryption framework in RHIBE since the
   security model of RHIBE is quite different with that of HIBE. We show
   that it is possible to solve the problem of the RHIBE security proof by
   carefully designing hybrid games. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {Contemporary software systems operate in heterogeneous, dynamic, and
   distributed environments, where security needs change at runtime. The
   security solutions for such systems need to be adaptive for the
   continuous satisfaction of the software systems' security goals. Whilst
   the existing research on self-adaptive security has made notable
   advancement towards designing and engineering self-adaptive security
   solutions, there exists little work on the taxonomic analysis of the
   architectures of the reported research and its applicability for open
   and ultra-large environments. We propose an architecture-centric
   taxonomy for mapping and comparing the current research and identifying
   the future research directions in this field. The proposed taxonomy has
   been used to review the representative work on the architectural
   characteristics that self-adaptive security systems must maintain for
   their effective application in large-scale open environments. We reflect
   on the findings from the taxonomic analysis and discuss the design
   principles, research challenges and limitations reported in the state of
   the art and practice. We outline the directions for the future research
   on architectural level support for self-adaptive security systems for

Abstract = {With the rapid popularization of Android system around the world, of the
   increase in Android malwares post serious threats to the security of

   many trusted third party institutions (such as military, government
   institutions) need to customize the security policy of their Android

   mechanism for Android platform called EAdroid, which providing a simple
   way for trusted third party institutions to customize the security
   policy of their Android devices. EAdroid reforms the framework layer of
   Android system and synthetically applies Smack security module of Linux.
   At the same time, the security rules of framework layer and kernel layer

Abstract = {This paper presents an original and adaptive security architecture for
   the future connected aircrafts. A secure system topology for the
   embedded network is proposed with regards to network and system
   constraints, service priorities and regulatory recommendations. The
   design of a new component called Security Manager (SecMan) is explained
   in details and all its processes are formalized for a better
   understanding of the proposal made in this paper. A performance study is
   done in order to assess the advantages of this adaptive security policy
   within some critical aircraft communication scenarios.
   The adaptive security architecture will be applied for a satellite-based
   system architecture of an industrial project titled ``FAST{''}
   (Fiber-like Aircraft Satellite Telecommunications). The project is
   co-funded by the Aerospace Valley pole and the French government
   (Direction Generale de la Competitivite, de l'Industrie et des Services
   - DGCIS, Fonds Unique Interministeriel - FUI). The FAST satellite system
   aims at providing bi-directional satellite communication services on
   commercial aircraft worldwide. Many partners take part in the project,
   both from industry (EADS Astrium, Axess Europe, Vodea, and Medes) and
   academy (CNRS/LAAS, ISAE, ENAC, Telecom Bretagne).},

Abstract = {Context: Mobile computing has emerged as a disruptive technology that
   has empowered its users with portable, connected and context-aware
   computation. However, issues such as resource poverty, energy efficiency
   and specifically data security and privacy represents the critical
   challenges for mobile computing. Objective: The objective of this work
   is to systematically identify, taxonomically classify and map the
   state-of-research on adaptive security (a.k.a. self-protection) for
   mobile computing. Methodology: We followed evidence based software
   engineering method to conduct a systematic mapping study of 43
   qualitatively selected studies-published from 2003 to 2017-on adaptive
   security for mobile computing. Results and Conclusions: Classification
   and mapping of the research highlights three prominent themes that
   support adaptive security for (i) Mobile Device Data and Resources, (ii)
   Mobile to Mobile Communication, and (iii) Mobile to Server
   Communication. Mapping analysis suggests that security of mobile device
   data and resources is the most researched theme. The mapping study
   highlights that active and futuristic research trends are primarily
   focused on security as a service, whereas; the frequent research
   challenges relate to self-protecting mobile devices, user-driven privacy
   decisions and context-aware security. The results of the mapping study
   facilitate knowledge transfer that can benefit researchers and
   practitioners to understand the role of adaptive and context-aware
   security in mobile computing environments.},

Abstract = {With the advent of network connectivity and complex software
   applications, life-critical systems like medical devices are subject to
   a plethora of security risks and vulnerabilities. Security threats and
   attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities have been shown to compromise
   patient safety by hampering essential functionality. This necessitates
   incorporating security from the very design of software. Isolation of
   software functionality into different modes and switching between them
   based on risk assessment, while maintaining a fail-safe mode ensuring
   device's essential functionality is a compelling design. Formal modeling
   is an essential ingredient for verification of such a design. Hence, in
   this paper, we formally model a trustworthy multi-modal framework for
   life-critical systems security and in turn safety. We formalize a
   multiple mode based software design approach of operation with a
   fail-safe mode that maintains critical functionality. We ensure
   trustworthyness by formalizing a composite risk model incorporated into
   the design for run-time risk assessment and management.},

Abstract = {Threshold public-key encryption (TPKE) allows a set of users to decrypt
   a ciphertext if a given threshold of authorized users cooperate.
   Existing TPKE schemes suffer from either long ciphertexts with size
   linear in the number of authorized users or can only achieve
   non-adaptive security. A non-adaptive attacker is assumed to disclose
   her target attacking set of users even before the system parameters are
   published: The notion of non-adaptive security is too weak to capture
   the capacity of the attackers in the real world. In this paper, we
   bridge these gaps by proposing an efficient TPKE scheme with
   constant-size ciphertexts and adaptive security. Security is proven
   under the decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponentiation (BDHE)
   assumption in the standard model. This implies that our proposal
   preserves security even if the attacker adaptively corrupts all the
   users outside the authorized set and some users in the authorized set,
   provided that the number of corrupted users in the authorized set is
   less than a threshold. We also propose an efficient tradeoff between the
   key size and the ciphertext size, which gives the first TPKE scheme with
   adaptive security and sublinear-size public key, decryption keys and
   ciphertext.},

Abstract = {The huge economic loss resulting from network attacks and intrusions has
   led to an intensive study on network security. The network security is
   usually reflected by some relevant data that can be collected in a
   network system. By learning and analyzing such data, which are called
   security-related data, we can detect the intrusions to the network
   system and further measure its security level. Clearly, the first step
   of detecting network intrusions is to collect security-related data.
   However, in the context of 5G and big data, there are a number of
   challenges in collecting these data due to the heterogeneity of network
   and ever-growing amount of data. Therefore, traditional data collection
   methods cannot be applied in the next generation network systems
   directly, especially for security-related data. This paper presents the
   design and implementation of an adaptive security-related data collector
   based on network context in heterogeneous networks. The proposed
   collector solves the issue of heterogeneity of network system by
   designing a Security-related Data Description Language (SDDL) to
   instruct security related data collection in various networking
   contexts. It also applies adaptive sampling algorithms to reduce the
   amount of collected data. Furthermore, performance evaluation based on a
   prototype implementation shows the effectiveness of the adaptive
   security-related data collector in terms of a number of pre-defined
   design requirements.},

Abstract = {Despite the availability of various methods and tools to facilitate
   secure coding, developers continue to write code that contains common
   vulnerabilities. It is important to understand why technological
   advances do not sufficiently facilitate developers in writing secure
   code. To widen our understanding of developers' behaviour, we considered
   the complexity of the security decision space of developers using theory
   from cognitive and social psychology. Our interdisciplinary study
   reported in this article (1) draws on the psychology literature to
   provide conceptual underpinnings for three categories of impediments to
   achieving security goals, (2) reports on an in-depth meta-analysis of
   existing software security literature that identified a catalogue of
   factors that influence developers' security decisions, and (3)
   characterises the landscape of existing security interventions that are
   available to the developer during coding and identifies gaps.
   Collectively, these show that different forms of impediments to
   achieving security goals arise from different contributing factors.
   Interventions will be more effectivewhere they reflect psychological
   factors more sensitively andmarry technical sophistication,
   psychological frameworks, and usability. Our analysis suggests
   ``adaptive security interventions{''} as a solution that responds to the
   changing security needs of individual developers and a present a
   proof-of-concept tool to substantiate our suggestion.},

Abstract = {In the era of the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0, machines and
   devices are increasingly getting connected. These connections go hand in
   hand with security vulnerabilities and potential threats to these
   devices. In regular IT systems, we typically provide updates to
   eliminate vulnerabilities. In industrial automation and control systems,
   especially in mass production, legacy systems are widespread and
   installing updates causes downtime. Availability is one of the top
   goals; stopping a machine in case of a cyber-security threat is often
   too expensive. But, system integrators and asset owners should not have
   to wait until product or component suppliers release appropriate
   updates. Due to safety and warranty requirements, developing and
   distributing updates can take a long time. In the meantime, attackers
   can pose threats by taking advantage of devices' known vulnerabilities.
   In this paper, we propose the design of resilient systems based on
   multi-modal architectures with several operational modes. When
   vulnerabilities of systems become known, or when systems get even
   attacked at some point, mode switching can overcome the time between
   vulnerability disclosure or attack, and the availability of
   corresponding security patches. Therefore, system integrators and asset
   owners can actively protect themselves by implicitly or explicitly
   switching to modes with reduced attack surfaces and, thus, with limited
   ranges of activity for attackers. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by

   includes tracing potential information flow through the device's

   Increasingly, however, security functionality is being entrusted to
   embedded software running on microprocessors within Such devices, so new
   strategies are needed for integrating information flow analyses of
   embedded program code with hardware analyses. Here we show how standard
   compiler principles can augment high-integrity security evaluations to
   allow seamless tracing of information flow through both the hardware and
   software of embedded systems. This is done by unifying input/output
   statements in embedded program execution paths with the hardware pins
   they access, and by associating significant software states with
   corresponding operating modes of the Surrounding electronic circuitry.},

Abstract = {In an adaptive security-critical system, security mechanisms change
   according to the type of threat posed by the environment. Specifying the
   behavior of these systems is difficult because conditions of the
   environment are difficult to describe until the system has been deployed
   and used for a length of time. This paper defines the problem of
   adaptation in security-critical systems, and outlines the RELAIS
   approach for expressing requirements and specifying the behavior in a
   way that helps identify the need for adaptation, and the appropriate
   adaptation behavior at runtime. The paper introduces the notion of
   adaptation via input approximation and proposes statistical machine
   learning techniques for realizing it. The approach is illustrated with a
   running example and is applied to a realistic security example from a
   cloud-based file-sharing application. Bayesian classification and
   logistic regression methods are used to implement adaptive
   specifications and these methods offer different levels of adaptive
   security and usability in the file-sharing application.},

   vehicular network, the Cloud service, and proxies called Tracking
   Authorities, in charge of performing Attribute Based Encryption (ABE).
   We provided selective encryption and adaptive security in the Tracking
   Authority (TA), using the machine learning classifier k-Nearest
   Neighbours (k-NN). We conducted experimental study to evaluate the
   efficiency of the proposed k-NN classifier in selective encryption and
   adaptive security. So we compared the accuracy of the predictions of
   k-NN classifier to the accuracy of predictions using Support Vector
   Machine (SVM) classifier. Experimental results, has shown that the k-NN
   classifier is more accurate than SVM classifier.},

Title = {SRE\_BBC: A Self-Adaptive Security Enabled Requirements Engineering
   Approach for SLA Smart Contracts in Blockchain-Based Cloud Systems},
Journal = {SENSORS},

Volume = {22},

Abstract = {Current blockchain-based cloud (BBC) systems have several security
   vulnerabilities regarding smart contracts (SC), and several attacks have
   been reported recently. The SC development lacks standard design
   processes that follow software lifecycle principles to model secure SC.
   Secondly, the security mechanisms in the SC are not constantly evolved
   to resist evolving adversary attacks. BBC systems lack self-adaptive
   security capability to make spontaneous decisions when adversarial
   attacks are encountered. To build a self-adaptive secure BBC system that
   follows standard software development lifecycle principles to model
   secure SC, we propose the so-called self-adaptive security RE\_BBC
   framework. The framework would utilize the MAPE-BBC adaptation loop to
   make decisions internally based on the threat models, goal models, and
   service level agreement (SLA) SC security specifications. The framework
   identifies vulnerabilities and threats and takes precautionary measures
   using self-adaptive SC agents. We validated the proposed methodology
   theoretically and empirically, and statistically proved the research
   questions and hypothesis using the t-test and Mann-Whitney U test.
   Subsequently, we compare our proposed approach with the Security Quality
   Requirements Engineering approach (SQUARE). The feasibility results and
   the replicated study results indicate that the proposed approach
   outperformed the SQUARE approach in terms of artifacts quality,
   self-adaptive security evaluation quality, efficiency in response time,
   complexity, and usefulness of the proposed approach for the Healthcare
   Data Management (HDM) system. SC security developers can immensely
   benefit from our proposed methodology. They need not reengineer SC from
   scratch; depending on their security needs and plan, the contract can be
   adapted to execute a new plan.},

Abstract = {Adaptive security can take dynamic trade-off decisions autonomously at
   runtime and is considered a key desirable attribute in the Internet of
   Things (IoT). However, there is no clear evidence that it can handle
   these trade-offs optimally to add value to such a complex and dynamic
   network. We present a scenario-based approach to recognize and evaluate
   typical security trade-off situations in the IoT. Using the Event-driven
   Adaptive Security (EDAS) model, we provide the assessment of dynamic
   trade-off decisions in the IoT. We have showed that an optimum trade-off
   mitigation response in the IoT can be automated by assessing various
   contextual requirements, such as the QoS and user preferences, thing
   capabilities, and the risk faced, at runtime. eHealth scenarios are
   examined to illustrate system application in IoT-based remote patient

Abstract = {We investigate the quality of security reductions for noninteractive key
   exchange (NIKE) schemes. Unlike for many other cryptographic building
   blocks (like public -key encryption, signatures, or zeroknowledge
   proofs), all known NIKE security reductions to date are nontight, i.e.,
   lose a factor of at least the number of users in the system. In that
   sense, NIKE forms a particularly elusive target for tight security
   reductions. The main technical obstacle in achieving tightly secure NIKE
   schemes are adaptive corruptions. Hence, in this work, we explore
   security notions and schemes that lie between selective security and
   fully adaptive security. Concretely: WE EXHIBIT A TRADEOFF BETWEEN KEY
   SIZE AND REDUCTION LOSS. We show that a tighter reduction can be bought
   by larger public and secret NIKE keys. Concretely, we present a simple
   NIKE scheme with a reduction loss of 0 (N2 log(v)/v2), and public and
   secret keys of 0(v) group elements, where N denotes the overall number
   of users in the system, and v is a freely adjustable scheme parameter.
   Our scheme achieves full adaptive security even against multiple ``test
   queries{''} (i.e., adversarial challenges), but requires keys of size
   0(N) to achieve (almost) tight security under the matrix Diffie-Hellman
   assumption. Still, already this simple scheme circumvents existing lower
   bounds. WE SHOW THAT THIS TRADEOFF IS INHERENT. We contrast the security
   of our simple scheme with a lower bound for all NIKE schemes in which
   shared keys can be expressed as an ``inner product in the exponent{''}.
   This result covers the original Diffie-Hellman NIKE scheme, as well as a
   large class of its variants, and in particular our simple scheme. Our
   lower bound gives a tradeoff between the ``dimension{''} of any such
   scheme (which directly corresponds to key sizes in existing schemes),
   and the reduction quality. For v = 0(N), this shows our simple scheme
   and reduction optimal (up to a logarithmic factor). WE EXHIBIT A
   TRADEOFF BETWEEN SECURITY AND KEY SIZE FOR TIGHT REDUCTIONS. We show
   that it is possible to circumvent the inherent tradeoff above by
   relaxing the desired security notion. Concretely, we consider the
   natural notion of semi-adaptive security, where the adversary has to
   commit to a single test query after seeing all public keys. As a
   feasibility result, we bring forward the first scheme that enjoys
   compact public keys and tight semi-adaptive security under the
   conjunction of the matrix Diffie-Hellman and learning with errors
   assumptions. We believe that our results shed a new light on the role of
   adaptivity in NIKE security, and also illustrate the special role of
   NIKE when it comes to tight security reductions.},

Abstract = {Existing attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes with revocation to
   secure the cloud-assisted Internet of Things (IoTs) raise challenges,
   such as eliminating the need for predefined public parameters in system
   initialization, performing the encryption and decryption operations
   efficiently, and achieving adaptive security under standard security
   assumption. In this article, we address these challenges by proposing an
   unbounded and efficient revocable ABE scheme with adaptive security for
   cloud-assisted IoTs. Distinct from the previous approaches in this
   field, our scheme not only efficiently realizes access control over
   encrypted data in a fine-grained and revocable way but also is proved to
   be adaptively secure under standard decision linear assumption.
   Meanwhile, the parameters do not need to be predefined in the system
   initialization and thus, our scheme satisfies the unbounded property.
   Moreover, the monotonic span program (MSP) is elegantly utilized as the
   access structure to reduce the number of bilinear pairing and
   exponentiation operations for encryption and decryption. Theoretical
   performance analysis and experiment evaluation disclose that our
   proposed scheme owns outstanding feasibility, efficiency, and
   effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Organizations have proposed the best practices of security activities in

   However, the implementation of the security activities are influenced by
   criteria which are interdependent to each other and dynamic. Those
   criteria are experience, skill and knowledge; teams workload;
   development team size; development timeline; and cost/budget. Therefore,
   the selection of security activities must be based on the priority of
   the criteria and adaptive. This paper addresses the adaptive security
   activities selection model as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)
   issue. Analytic Network Process (ANP) is proposed for weight calculation
   and criteria prioritization. Hypothetical examples were presented based
   on hard constraints faced by in-house web-based application development
   team in two different scenarios. The Decision Maker made the judgement
   by using the online ASAS model. The results show that experience, skill
   and knowledge get the highest priority in the first scenario while
   budget/ cost get the highest priority in the second scenario. These
   prioritization will be used as a major requirement in security

   grade based on probabilistic risk index. In the proposed method, system
   risk under other operational modes is converted into the security grade
   under basic operational mode. Thus, when operational mode changes, the
   security grade change can reflect the degree of system security change

Abstract = {The suggested Hazmat transport Security Vulnerability Assessment (SVA)
   methodology presents a user-friendly approach to determine relative
   security risk levels of the different modes of hazardous freight
   transport (i.e., road, railway, inland waterways and pipeline
   transportation). First, transport routes are divided into smaller route
   segments. Second, likelihood scores of security-related accidents in
   which dangerous freight is involved and possibly causing fatalities in
   the surrounding population, are determined per route segment. Third, the
   consequences of accident scenarios (using reference products and spatial
   plans) are calculated in terms of the number of people within the 1\%
   lethality distance of the accident center. Fourth, using these
   likelihood scores and consequence figures, transport route security risk
   levels are determined. Fifth, transshipment risks are considered for
   determining the final transport route security risk levels. This leads
   to a multi-modal user-friendly security threat assessment tool which can
   be used by policy makers as well as by industrialists (shippers or
   Logistics Service Providers). The generic method allows for comparing
   the security risk levels of the different route segments and routes of
   transportation of hazardous goods and for taking countermeasures from a
   uni-modal as well as from a multi-modal perspective. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {Providing satisfactory security services in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks
   (MANET) is indispensable to its mission critical applications; however,
   often a highly secure mechanism inevitably consumes a rather large
   amount of system resources, which in turn May unintentionally cause a
   security provisioning Denial of Service (SPDoS) attack. The scheme
   proposed in this paper sets out a framework to solve this problem by
   designing a resource-aware self-adaptive network security provisioning
   scheme. With the support of the offline optimal secure protocol
   selection module and the online self-adaptive security control module,
   the framework is capable of deploying different combinations of secure
   protocols to satisfy different security need at different condition for
   different applications. Consequently, the proposed self-adaptive
   security provisioning achieves the maximum overall network security
   services and network performance services, without causing the SPDoS
   attack. Moreover, it provides additional security capability via
   security services hopping.},

Abstract = {Security enforcement framework is an important aspect of any distributed
   system. With new requirements imposed by SOA-based business models,
   adaptive security enforcement on the application level becomes even more
   important. Our work on the enforcement framework to date has resulted in
   a comprehensive middleware-based solution leveraging on web services
   technologies. However, potential merits of hardware-based solutions to
   further secure application exposure have not been considered so far.
   This paper describes a method for combining software resource level
   security features offered by Web Services technologies, with the
   hardware-based security mechanisms offered by Trusted Computing Platform
   and system virtualisation approaches. In particular, we propose
   trust-based architecture for protecting the enforcement middleware
   deployed at the policy enforcement endpoints of web and grid services.
   The main motivation is to additionally secure execution environment of
   the applications, by providing virtual machine level separation that
   maps from logical domains imposed by web services level enforcement
   policies.},

   resource constrained processing, storage and multiple factors.
   Additionally, the legacy systems are mostly centralized and thus
   introduce a single point of failure. In this research, a novel
   framework, FBASHI is presented that is based on fuzzy logic and
   blockchain technology to achieve AAA services. The proposed system is
   developed using Hyperledger that is a blockchain platform providing
   privacy and fast response capability, therefore, it is best suited for
   the healthcare IoT environments. This work proposes behavior driven
   adaptive security mechanism for healthcare IoTs and networks based on
   blockchain by utilizing fuzzy logic and presents a heuristic approach
   towards behavior driven adaptive security providing AAA services. FBASHI
   is implemented to analyze its security and practicality. Furthermore, a
   comparison is drawn with other blockchain-based solutions.},

Abstract = {Adaptive security systems aim to protect critical assets in the face of
   changes in their operational environment. We have argued that
   incorporating an explicit representation of the environment's topology
   enables reasoning on the location of assets being protected and the
   proximity of potentially harmful agents. This paper proposes to engineer
   topology aware adaptive security systems by identifying violations of
   security requirements that may be caused by topological changes, and
   selecting a set of security controls that prevent such violations. Our
   approach focuses on physical topologies; it maintains at runtime a live
   representation of the topology which is updated when assets or agents
   move, or when the structure of the physical space is altered. When the
   topology changes, we look ahead at a subset of the future system states.
   These states are reachable when the agents move within the physical
   space. If security requirements can be violated in future system states,
   a configuration of security controls is proactively applied to prevent
   the system from reaching those states. Thus, the system continuously
   adapts to topological stimuli, while maintaining requirements
   satisfaction. Security requirements are formally expressed using a
   propositional temporal logic, encoding spatial properties in Computation
   Tree Logic (CTL). The Ambient Calculus is used to represent the topology
   of the operational environment -including location of assets and agents
   - as well as to identify future system states that are reachable from
   the current one. The approach is demonstrated and evaluated using a
   substantive example concerned with physical access control.},

Abstract = {In a functional encryption (FE) scheme, the owner of the secret key can
   generate restricted decryption keys that allow users to learn specific
   functions of the encrypted messages and nothing else. In many known
   constructions of FE schemes, security is guaranteed only for messages
   that are fixed ahead of time (i.e., before the adversary even interacts
   with the system). This so-called selective security is too restrictive
   for many realistic applications. Achieving adaptive security (also
   called full security), where security is guaranteed even for messages
   that are adaptively chosen at any point in time, seems significantly
   more challenging. The handful of known adaptively-secure schemes are
   based on specifically tailored techniques that rely on strong
   assumptions (such as obfuscation or multilinear maps assumptions).
   We show that any sufficiently-expressive selectively-secure FE scheme
   can be transformed into an adaptively-secure one without introducing any
   additional assumptions. We present a black-box transformation, for both
   public-key and private-key schemes, making novel use of hybrid
   encryption, a classical technique that was originally introduced for
   improving the efficiency of encryption schemes. We adapt the hybrid
   encryption approach to the setting of functional encryption via a
   technique for embedding a ``hidden execution thread{''} in the
   decryption keys of the underlying scheme, which will only be activated
   within the proof of security of the resulting scheme. As an additional
   application of this technique, we show how to construct functional
   encryption schemes for arbitrary circuits starting from ones for shallow
   circuits (NC1 or even TC0).},

Abstract = {Semi-adaptive security is a notion of security that lies between
   selective and adaptive security for Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) and
   Functional Encryption (FE) systems. In the semi-adaptive model the
   attacker is forced to disclose the challenge messages before it makes
   any key queries, but is allowed to see the public parameters.
   We show how to generically transform any selectively secure ABE or FE
   scheme into one that is semi-adaptively secure with the only additional
   assumption being public key encryption, which is already naturally
   included in almost any scheme of interest. Our technique utilizes a
   fairly simple application of garbled circuits where instead of
   encrypting directly, the encryptor creates a garbled circuit that takes
   as input the public parameters and outputs a ciphertext in the
   underlying selective scheme. Essentially, the encryption algorithm
   encrypts without knowing the `real' public parameters. This allows one
   to delay giving out the underlying selective parameters until a private
   key is issued, which connects the semi-adaptive to selective security.
   The methods used to achieve this result suggest that the moral gap
   between selective and semi-adaptive security is in general much smaller
   than that between semiadaptive and full security.
   Finally, we show how to extend the above idea to generically bundle a
   family of functionalities under one set of public parameters. For
   example, suppose we had an inner product predicate encryption scheme
   where the length of the vectors was specified at setup and therefore
   fixed to the public parameters. Using our transformation one could
   create a system where for a single set of public parameters the vector
   length is not apri-ori bounded, but instead is specified by the
   encryption algorithm. The resulting ciphertext would be compatible with
   any private key generated to work on the same input length.},

   First, we present a new definition of security that we call semi-static.
   security and show a generic ``two-key{''} transformation from
   semi-statically secure systems to adaptively secure systems that have
   comparable-size ciphertexts. Using bilinear maps, we then construct
   broadcast encryption systems that are semi-statically secure in the
   standard model and have constant-size ciphertexts. Our semi-static
   constructions work when the number of indices or identifiers in the
   system is polynomial in the security parameter.
   For identity-based broadcast encryption, where the number of potential
   indices or identifiers may be exponential, we present the first
   adaptively secure system with sublinear ciphertexts. We prove security

Abstract = {Communication-dependent and software-based distributed energy resources
   (DERs) are extensively inte-grated into modern microgrids, providing
   extensive benefits such as increased distributed controllability,
   scalability, and observability. However, malicious cyber-attackers can
   exploit various potential vulnerabilities. In this study, a programmable
   adaptive security scanning (PASS) approach is presented to protect DER
   inverters against various power-bot attacks. Specifically, three
   different types of attacks, namely controller manipulation, replay, and
   injection attacks, are considered. This approach employs both
   software-defined networking technique and a novel coordinated detection
   method capable of enabling programmable and scalable networked
   microgrids (NMs) in an ultra-resilient, time-saving, and autonomous
   manner. The coordinated detection method efficiently identifies the
   location and type of power-bot attacks without disrupting normal NM
   operations. Extensive simulation results validate the efficacy and
   practicality of the PASS for securing NMs. (c) 2021 THE AUTHORS.

Abstract = {One of the most important use-cases of Trusted Computing is Remote
   Attestation. It allows platforms to get a trustworthy proof of the
   loaded software and current configuration of certain remote platforms,
   thereby enabling them to make decisions about the remote platforms'
   trust status. Common concepts like Internet Protocol security or
   Transport Layer Security make these decisions based on shared secrets or
   certificates issued by third parties. Unlike remote attestation, these
   concepts do not take the current configuration or currently loaded
   software of the platforms into account. Consequently, combining remote
   attestation and existing secure channel concepts can solve the long
   lasting problem of secure channels that have to rely on insecure channel
   endpoints. Although this gap can now be closed by Trusted Computing, one
   important problem remains unsolved: A platform's configuration changes
   every time new software is loaded. Consequently, a reliable and in-time
   method to provide a proof for this configuration change especially on
   multiprocess machines - is required to signal the platforms involved in
   the communication that a configuration change of the respectively other
   platform has taken place. Our research results show that a simple
   reporting mechanism can be integrated into current Trusted Platform
   Modules and Transport Layer Security implementations with a few
   additional Trusted Platform Modules commands and a few extensions to the
   TLS protocol.},

Abstract = {Biometric verification has attracted attention recently because it is
   more secure than knowledge- or token-based verification techniques.
   Multi-modal biometric verification can provide even greater accuracy by
   combining several forms of biometrics. However, there are problems with
   the availability, usability and acceptability of the technique. In this
   paper, we take a new approach in proposing a multi-modal biometric
   system that enables users to select which biometrics they prefer to be
   matched at the time of verification. This system also reduces the number
   of inputs required by adopting a sequential test based on statistical
   methods. In addition, the accuracy of the system can be controlled
   according to the security level required. We demonstrated the
   effectiveness of the proposed system experimentally.},

Abstract = {In this article, the dynamic event-triggered model-free adaptive

   into a linearization data model by using the dynamic linearization
   technique. For the subway system, both speed and traction/braking forces
   need to be restrained to ensure the safety of the subway equipment. In
   addition, the dynamic event-triggered mechanism is designed to reduce
   communication frequency and prolong the hardware life cycle. At the same
   time, considering aperiodic DoS attacks in the network channel, the
   security tracking control problem is guaranteed. In the simulation, the
   algorithm is applied to the subway train system, and the effectiveness
   of this algorithm is verified with a comparison.},

Abstract = {We present in this paper an adaptive security model for Multi-agent
   systems. A security meta-model has been developed in which the
   traditional role concept has been extended. The new concept incorporates
   the need of both security management as used by role-based access
   control (RBAC) and agent functional behaviour in agent-oriented Software
   Engineering (AOSE). Our approach avoids, weaknesses of traditional RBAC
   approaches and provides a practically usable security model for
   Multi-agent Systems (MAS). A unified role interaction model framework
   has been put forward that incorporates not only functional requirements
   but also security constraints in MAS. A security policy rule scheme has
   been used to express security requirements in relation to affective
   roles. The major contribution of the work is that little redevelopment
   effort will be required when security is to be engineered into the
   overall MAS architecture, hence minimising the impact of the security
   requirements changes to the MAS architecture. We illustrate the approach
   through its potential application in a clinical trial setting involving
   a prototype medical decision support system, HealthAgents.},

Abstract = {Since modern cyber-physical power systems are vulnerable to coordinated
   wide-area cyber attacks, it is necessary to mitigate the potential risk
   as much as possible. At the planning stage, the defender can utilize
   software diversity, which is a common phenomenon that the cyber software
   of different substations comes from different competing vendors.
   Therefore, different kinds of software may not be exposed to the same
   zero-day security loophole, preventing the attacker from taking charge
   of multiple substations at the same time. In this paper, the optimal
   scheme of software deployment considering long-term risk mitigation is
   studied. Firstly, the framework of diversity-based cyber defense against
   malicious attacks is formulated. Secondly, the risk index based on
   representative attack patterns is constructed, which is the objective to
   be minimized. Thirdly, considering that the deployment scheme is
   long-term stable while the operating mode varies with time, we construct
   a multiobjective nonlinear stochastic programming to mitigate the
   average risk of operating modes. Then the optimization problem is solved
   by the multiobjective genetic algorithm. Lastly, results of the IEEE
   39-node CPPS and and the Virtual European Grid demonstrate that the
   proposed method can considerably reduce the attack risk.},

Abstract = {The security policies for computing resources must match the security
   policies of the organizations that use them; therefore, computer
   security policies must be adaptive to meet the changing security
   environment of their user-base. This paper presents four methods for
   implementing adaptive security policies for architectures which separate
   the definition of the policy in a Security Server from the enforcement
   which is done by the kernel. The four methods discussed include
   reloading a new security database for the Security Server,
   expanding the state and security database of the Security Server to
   include more than one mode of operation,
   implementing another Security Server and handing off control for
   security computations, and
   implementing multiple, concurrent Security Servers each controlling a
   subset of processes.
   Each of these methods comes with a set of tradeoffs: policy flexibility,
   functional flexibility, security, reliability, and performance. This
   paper evaluates each of the implementations with respect to each of
   these criteria. Although the methods described in this paper were
   implemented for the Distributed Trusted Operating System (DTOS)
   prototype, this paper describes general research, and the conclusions
   drawn from this work need not be limited to that development
   platform.(1).},

Title = {Trusted Operation of Cyber-Physical Processes Based on Assessment of the
   System's State and Operating Mode},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We consider the trusted operation of cyber-physical processes based on
   an assessment of the system's state and operating mode and present a
   method for detecting anomalies in the behavior of a cyber-physical
   system (CPS) based on the analysis of the data transmitted by its
   sensory subsystem. Probability theory and mathematical statistics are
   used to process and normalize the data in order to determine whether or
   not the system is in the correct operating mode and control process
   state. To describe the mode-specific control processes of a CPS, the
   paradigm of using cyber-physical parameters is taken as a basis, as it
   is the feature that most clearly reflects the system's interaction with
   physical processes. In this study, two metrics were taken as a sign of
   an anomaly: the probability of falling into the sensor values'
   confidence interval and parameter change monitoring. These two metrics,
   as well as the current mode evaluation, produce a final probability
   function for our trust in the CPS's currently executing control process,
   which is, in turn, determined by the operating mode of the system. Based
   on the results of this trust assessment, it is possible to draw a
   conclusion about the processing state in which the system is operating.
   If the score is higher than 0.6, it means the system is in a trusted
   state. If the score is equal to 0.6, it means the system is in an
   uncertain state. If the trust score tends towards zero, then the system
   can be interpreted as unstable or under stress due to a system failure
   or deliberate attack. Through a case study using cyber-attack data for
   an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), it was found that the method works
   well. When we were evaluating the normal flight mode, there were no
   false positive anomaly estimates. When we were evaluating the UAV's
   state during an attack, a deviation and an untrusted state were
   detected. This method can be used to implement software solutions aimed
   at detecting system faults and cyber-attacks, and thus make decisions
   about the presence of malfunctions in the operation of a CPS, thereby
   minimizing the amount of knowledge and initial data about the system.},

Abstract = {Multimodal biometrics is an emerging technology for distributed data
   security. Single and multi-user data authentication plays a vital role
   in commercial or e-governance applications. Many approaches have been
   implemented in literature to secure the single user data using biometric
   security systems. Most of these systems are based on static
   initialization parameters and fixed multi-modal biometric features for
   data authentication. Also, traditional multi-modal biometric based data
   authentication schemes are independent of dynamic variation in integrity
   verification. In order to overcome these problems, a new multi-user
   based multi-modal authentication framework is designed and implemented
   on large image data types. In this framework, different biometric
   features such as IRIS, facial and fingerprint features are used to find
   the unique integrity of user for data authentication and security
   process. A new integrity computational algorithm and encryption
   technique are implemented to provide the strong data integrity
   verification and data security in distributed applications. Experimental
   results show that the proposed multi-modal integrity-based encryption
   model has nearly 7\% of computational integrity bit change and 5\% of
   runtime on large dataset.},

Abstract = {Mobile cloud computing is an emerging area in the cloud computing
   paradigm, comprising several modes of communication that are governed by
   varying security standards. WBAN (Wireless Body Area Networks), RFID
   (Radio Frequency IDentification) and VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks)
   are three example applications that could be based on mobile cloud
   computing. Considering the fact that the security mechanisms in
   different applications are highly heterogeneous while the cloud server
   is common to these applications, we devised a context-adaptive security
   framework that could be deployed at the cloud premises to provide an
   additional security layer to mobile cloud computing systems.
   Furthermore, the framework provides varied techniques to improve the
   quality of service and reliability of mobile cloud computing.
   Technically, this multi-component context-adaptive framework accepts the
   traffic in different communication modes, prevents attacks by randomly
   choosing pre-defined algorithms, learns from previous attacks using
   cognitive model, and rearranges the cloud service model as a
   self-healing system.},

Abstract = {Secure authentication for smartphones is becoming important for many
   applications such as financial transactions. Until today PIN and
   password authentication are the most commonly used methods for
   smartphone access control. Specifically for a PIN and limited length
   passwords, the level of security is low and thus can be compromised
   easily. In this work, we propose a multi-modal biometric system, which
   uses face, periocular and iris biometric characteristics for
   authentication. The proposed system is tested on two different devices -
   Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. An
   extensive set of experiments conducted using the proposed system shows
   the applicability for secure authentication scenarios. The proposed
   system is tested using uni-modal and multi-modal approach. An Equal
   Error Rate (EER) of 0.68\% is obtained from the experiments validating
   the robust performance of the proposed system.},

Abstract = {Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) have become a viable platform owing to
   their potential of providing communication without any pre-existing
   infrastructure and central administrating authority. Mutual support and
   co-operation among nodes are prerequisites for performing functions in
   such networks. The scarcity of resources makes it economical for nodes
   to conserve their resources and misbehave by avoiding participation in
   the network. Therefore, a mechanism is required to detect and handle
   such misbehaving nodes and promote co-operation in the network. Existing
   techniques for handling misbehaving nodes focus only on their current
   behaviour without considering the antecedent behaviour of nodes. In real
   world, a node may dynamically change its behaviour in accordance to its
   requirements. Hence, an efficient mechanism is required for providing
   security against such misbehaviour. This paper proposes an Adaptive
   Security Model which contemplates the present as well as anterior
   behaviour of nodes for providing security against dynamic node
   behaviour. The adaptivity of the model is nested in its ability to
   requite well-behaving nodes and penalize misbehaving ones in conformity
   with their overall behaviour. Simulation results indicate the efficiency
   of proposed scheme in securing the network from the menace of dynamic
   behaviour of nodes.},

Abstract = {Cybersecurity incidents are increasing, and at the same time, our
   society depends more and more on cyber-physical systems. Systematic
   approaches to measure cybersecurity are needed in order to support
   efficient construction and maintenance of secure software systems.
   Security measurement of software architectures is needed to produce
   sufficient evidence of security level as early as in the design phase.
   Design-time security measuring should support ``security by design{''}
   approach. Moreover, software architectures have to support runtime
   security measurement to obtain up-to-date security information from an
   online software system, service or product. Security metrics and
   measurements are exploited in situational awareness monitoring and
   self-adaptive security solutions. The area of security metrics and
   security assurance metrics research is evolving, but still lacks widely
   accepted metrics definitions and applicable measuring techniques. Strong
   collaboration between security experts, software architects and system
   developers is needed to address this. MeSSa2017 workshop addresses these
   and other related topics to increase the importance of the overall
   picture, requiring sets of design patterns, measurements, metrics, best
   practices, and means to integrate this cost-effectively in the overall
   design and operational profiles.
   The outcome of the workshop will be an increased shared understanding of
   challenges and opportunities in systematic approaches to measure
   cybersecurity, which are needed in order to support efficient
   construction and maintenance of secure software systems.},

   existing bounded IBRS schemes have the advantage of short ciphertexts,
   however, they cannot support an increase of N and have to fix a large N
   to provide the revocation. This compromises the computational
   efficiency, which is linear in N. To bridge this gap, we are interested
   in exploring whether N can be dynamic. Precisely, N is initially set as
   a small number and increased into a larger one when more than N
   identities are revoked, while this increase does not affect other
   non-revoked users in the system. In this paper, motivated by the
   security of bounded IBRS with a dynamic N, we define an enhanced
   security model, which allows the corruption of any polynomial number
   (e.g., n) of private keys, independent of N. It augments existing
   security models by running different challenges when n <= N and n > N,
   respectively. The enhanced security model suits both unbounded 1BRS and
   bounded IBRS with a general description that can be ``empty{''} for
   unbounded IBRS or a special N for bounded IBRS. Then, we propose a
   scalable bounded IBRS scheme and are able to prove its security in an
   enhanced security model. The increase of N incurs no changing on all of
   the existing private keys and the only cost is a slight expansion of the
   master public keys. Our proposed scheme also has short ciphertexts and
   private keys, comparable to the state-of-the-art (bounded) IBRS schemes.

Abstract = {Multi-modal biometric systems (MBS) are an enhancement of unibiometric
   systems where recognition is based on multiple biological traits of the
   user. Once the biological traits of a user are captured through sensors,
   the unique feature points are extracted from each modality and
   represented as a feature vector. The privacy and security of feature
   templates in biometric recognition systems are the top design issues,
   which is gaining the attention of the majority of research community. In
   this paper, a hybrid template security technique is designed for a
   bi-modal biometric system based on fingerprint and hand geometry. The
   technique first use the bio-hashing, in order to transform the actual
   feature vectors (FVs) into respective binary feature vectors (BFVs) and
   then applying a transformation scheme to fuse the binary vectors into a
   secured template. In order to improve the storage overhead for the
   protected template, a novel octet indexing technique is applied on the
   intermediate feature vector (IFV). The proposed technique results in
   improvement of storage requirement by representing secured template as a
   64-bits vector with octet indexing. Furthermore, the proposed technique
   results in the overall enhancement of the recognition accuracy as
   compared to fingerprint and hand geometry uni-biometrics. The proposed
   hybrid scheme results in a recognition rate of 98.4\% and an equal error
   rate (EER) of 0.48\%, with improvement in template storage overhead up
   to 50\%.},

Abstract = {Two-level system model based probabilistic steady-state and dynamic
   security assessment model is introduced in this paper. Uncertainties of
   nodal power injection caused by wind power and load demand, steady-state
   and dynamic security constraints and transitions between system
   configurations in terms of failure rate and repair rate are considered
   in the model. Time to insecurity is used as security index. The
   probability distribution of time to insecurity can be obtained by
   solving a linear vector differential equation. The coefficients of the
   differential equation are expressed in terms of configuration transition
   rates and security transition probabilities. The model is implemented in
   complex system successfully for the first time by using the following
   effective measures: firstly, calculating configuration transition rates
   effectively based on component state transition rate matrix and system
   configuration array; secondly, calculating the probability of random
   nodal power injection belonging to security region effectively according
   to practical parts of critical boundaries of security region represented
   by hyper-planes; thirdly, locating non-zero elements of coefficient
   matrix and then implementing sparse storage of coefficient matrix
   effectively; finally, calculating security region off-line for on-line
   use. Results of probabilistic security assessment can be used to conduct
   operators to analyze system security effectively and take preventive
   control. Test results on New England 10-generators and 39-buses power
   system verify the reasonableness and effectiveness of the method.},

   Encrypting files or exchanged messages as a set' of segments in

   this facility has been used to propose an encryption system that
   compromise between security and performance using the concept of

Abstract = {Ubiquitous computing is resulting in a proliferation of cyber-physical
   systems that host or manage valuable physical and digital assets. These
   assets can be harmed by malicious agents through both cyber-enabled or
   physically-enabled attacks, particularly ones that exploit the often
   ignored interplay between the cyber and physical world. The explicit
   representation of spatial topology is key to supporting adaptive
   security policies. In this paper we explore the use of Bigraphical
   Reactive Systems to model the topology of cyber and physical spaces and
   their dynamics. We utilise such models to perform speculative threat
   analysis through model checking to reason about the consequences of the
   evolution of topological configurations on the satisfaction of security
   requirements. We further propose an automatic planning technique to
   identify an adaptation strategy enacting security policies at runtime to
   prevent, circumvent, or mitigate possible security requirements
   violations. We evaluate our approach using a case study concerned with
   countering insider threats in a building automation system.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present a model to allocate security resources within a
   chemical supply chain which is characterized by the use of different
   transportation modes, each having their own security features. We
   consider security-related risks so asto take measures against terrorist
   acts which could target critical transportation systems. The idea of
   addressing security-related issues, by supporting decisions for
   preventing or mitigating intentional acts on transportation
   infrastructure, has gainedattention in academic research only recently.
   The decision model presented in this paper is based on game theory. The
   MultI-modal Security-TRAnsportation modeL, that we named MISTRAL for
   short, can be employed to organize intelligence capabilities aimed at
   securing chemical supply chains. It enables detection and warning
   against impending attacks on transportation infrastructures and the
   subsequent adoption of security countermeasures. This is of extreme
   importance for preventing terrorist attacks and for avoiding (possibly
   huge) human and economic losses.},

Abstract = {Bike sharing systems (BSSs) are getting popular in many cities of the
   world as an integrated part of multi modal journey due to its
   flexibility and eco-friendly nature. Future BSSs will have a pool of
   Internet of Things (IoT)integrated smart bikes with computation and
   communication capabilities. Such systems will be able to provide the
   service providers with real-time and non-real-time information about
   user demands, bikes and environments for improved quality of services.
   However, manipulation of logistics data (e.g. showing availability of
   bikes or parking where none may exist) and mobility operations (e.g.
   unauthorized tampering with service-related data) may disrupt the whole
   service. This paper proposes a framework for secure bike sharing service
   under multi-modal journey environment using symmetric key encryption and
   digital signature. Our proposal lets a service provider to collect
   information from stations and external service providers, and
   communicate with users in a secure way so that the user gets correct
   information and a quality service. The proposed framework has the
   potential to offer enhanced quality of service through security features
   compared to existing systems for multi-modal transport users.},

Abstract = {Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) 5500 Series Firewall is amongst
   the most popular and technically advanced for securing organisational
   networks and systems. One of its most valuable features is its threat
   detection function which is available on every version of the firewall
   running a software version of 8.0(2) or higher. Threat detection
   operates at layers 3 and 4 to determine a baseline for network traffic,
   analysing packet drop statistics and generating threat reports based on
   traffic patterns. Despite producing a large volume of statistical
   information relating to several security events, further effort is
   required to mine and visually report more significant information and
   conclude the security status of the network. There are several
   commercial off-the-shelf tools available to undertake this task,
   however, they are expensive and may require a cloud subscription.
   Furthermore, if the information transmitted over the network is
   sensitive or requires confidentiality, the involvement of a third party
   or a third-party tool may place organisational security at risk.
   Therefore, this paper presents a fuzzy logic aided intelligent threat
   detection solution, which is a cost-free, intuitive and comprehensible
   solution, enhancing and simplifying the threat detection process for
   all. In particular, it employs a fuzzy reasoning system based on the
   threat detection statistics, and presents results/threats through a
   developed dashboard user interface, for ease of understanding for
   administrators and users. The paper further demonstrates the successful
   utilisation of a fuzzy reasoning system for selected and prioritised
   security events in basic threat detection, although it can be extended
   to encompass more complex situations, such as complete basic threat
   detection, advanced threat detection, scanning threat detection, and
   customised feature based threat detection.},

Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Self-protecting software systems are a class of autonomic systems
   capable of detecting and mitigating security threats at runtime. They
   are growing in importance, as the stovepipe static methods of securing
   software systems have been shown to be inadequate for the challenges
   posed by modern software systems. Self-protection, like other self-{*}
   properties, allows the system to adapt to the changing environment
   through autonomic means without much human intervention, and can thereby
   be responsive, agile, and cost effective. While existing research has
   made significant progress towards autonomic and adaptive security, gaps
   and challenges remain. This article presents a significant extension of
   our preliminary study in this area. In particular, unlike our
   preliminary study, here we have followed a systematic literature review
   process, which has broadened the scope of our study and strengthened the
   validity of our conclusions. By proposing and applying a comprehensive
   taxonomy to classify and characterize the state-of-the-art research in
   this area, we have identified key patterns, trends and challenges in the
   existing approaches, which reveals a number of opportunities that will
   shape the focus of future research efforts.},

Abstract = {There are various techniques to safeguard computer systems and networks
   against illegal actions. Secure OS based on Role Based Access Control
   (RBAC) is one of the systems that reflect these techniques. The RBAC
   system controls access to system resources based on roles. Recently,
   many systems employ more fine-grained access control on system resources
   to enhance system security. However, this approach in access control
   level may cause unexpected problems, since most systems acquire system
   resources through system call that is hooked on kernel. In this paper,
   we propose a novel approach to Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The
   proposed Autonomic Protection System (APS) supports fine-grained
   intrusion detection. It resides above Secure OS based on RBAC that
   provides general-grained access control. The system detects intrusions
   using security policy based on RBAC model. The system performs double
   checking for intrusions using positive and negative intrusion detection
   policy. Additionally, as one of active responses, the system supports
   the self-adaptation of security policy depending on various computing
   environments. Therefore, the system can detect intrusions more
   accurately and respond to the attacks actively and appropriately.},

Abstract = {In Covid 19, pandemic remote proctoring of the employee or human being
   is evolved as a big challenge for the information retrieval process. On
   the other side, memory-based system access authentication is becoming
   outdated and less preferred for live applications, especially where data
   security and customer privacy are crucial. Multi-modal authentication
   has outperformed the unimodal process with high accuracy and improved
   security in the user authentication field. Multi-modal biometric
   verification includes user attributes such as keystrokes, iris, speech,
   face, etc. For real-time execution of multi-modal biometric fusion-based
   live tracking for compatible applications. The study proposes an
   efficient continuous biometric user authentication system for a new
   challenge of pandemic time, a live online authentication of the
   evaluation process (CBUA-OE). The proposed CBUA-OE system can address
   the challenges associated with live proctoring and is also compatible
   with real-time implementation, deployment of authentication systems. The
   modified wolf optimization algorithm and CUBA-OE's optimal feature
   fusion algorithm give an edge over the other contemporary methods and
   make it more robust. In modern forms of authentication, the
   classification stage affects the overall outcome of the system, and the
   model's performance is also a factor of varying quality of datasets. In
   contrast, a hybrid LCNN-Salp swarm optimization-based classifier is more
   efficient and consistent in continuous user authentication. Here the
   performance of the proposed hybrid LCNN-Salp swarm optimization
   classifier is analyzed with different standard datasets. The results are
   compared with the existing state-of-art classifiers regarding the
   accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. This projected work is novel
   in terms of usability factors and scalability to live tracking systems.},

Abstract = {Public transport security is one of the main priorities of the public
   authorities when fighting against crime and terrorism. In this context,
   there is a great demand for autonomous systems able to detect abnormal
   events such as violent acts aboard passenger cars and intrusions when
   the train is parked at the depot. To this end, we present an innovative
   approach which aims at providing efficient automatic event detection by
   fusing video and audio analytics and reducing the false alarm rate
   compared to classical stand-alone video detection. The multi-modal
   system is composed of two microphones and one camera and integrates
   onboard video and audio analytics and fusion capabilities. On the one
   hand, for detecting intrusion, the system relies on the fusion of
   ``unusual{''} audio events detection with intrusion detections from
   video processing. The audio analysis consists in modeling the normal
   ambience and detecting deviation from the trained models during testing.
   This unsupervised approach is based on clustering of automatically
   extracted segments of acoustic features and statistical Gaussian Mixture
   Model (GMM) modeling of each cluster. The intrusion detection is based
   on the three-dimensional (3D) detection and tracking of individuals in
   the videos. On the other hand, for violent events detection, the system
   fuses unsupervised and supervised audio algorithms with video event
   detection. The supervised audio technique detects specific events such
   as shouts. A GMM is used to catch the formant structure of a shout
   signal. Video analytics use an original approach for detecting
   aggressive motion by focusing on erratic motion patterns specific to
   violent events. As data with violent events is not easily available, a
   normality model with structured motions from non-violent videos is
   learned for one-class classification. A fusion algorithm based on
   Dempster-Shafer's theory analyses the asynchronous detection outputs and
   computes the degree of belief of each probable event.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of computer network technology and the fact
   that the network brings convenience to people's lives and work, security
   issues cannot be ignored. Various countries and social organizations
   build a network security vulnerability database based on big data
   analysis technology, use network offensive and defensive platforms to
   train network security talents, and the target environment as a core
   component in the offensive and defensive platforms plays an important
   role in practice. We construct a large network security data set with a
   security knowledge system, analyze the current construction technology
   and vulnerability data characteristics of major vulnerability databases
   at home and abroad from multiple levels, and propose a vulnerability
   information correlation technology based on a combination of general
   vulnerability numbers and specific vulnerability numbers. Also, we
   comprehensively analyze each vulnerability database, assess the
   comprehensiveness and coverage of the vulnerability data information
   covered, and establish the source of the vulnerability data, data
   reference, security content automation protocol support, proof of
   concept, platform environment affected by the vulnerability exploitation
   code situation, and other fields of network security big data sets with
   security knowledge system. Here, we have completed the design and
   implementation of the user rights management module, the centralized
   monitoring module, and the service desk and configuration change
   management module. The system can accurately monitor the operation of
   the system in real time, find problems in time, warn of potential risks,
   and promote the operation and maintenance approach to intelligent. The
   transformation has improved the efficiency of fault diagnosis and
   greatly enhanced the safety of the system. Experimental research shows
   that the software system automatically screens and manually confirms the
   vulnerabilities that meet the target construction environment, and
   initially constructs a total of 43 effective target environments, which
   provides security researchers with the understanding of vulnerability
   principles, hazards, and targeted network security training. A stable
   and convenient experimental environment.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the distributed adaptive security consensus control
   problem of a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems subject to network
   decay and intermittent attacks. The network communication is decayed and
   intermittently attacked by attackers, which may result in loss of
   transmission effectiveness and communication outage, respectively. A
   distributed adaptive consensus control strategy is firstly developed to
   ensure bounded con sensus of the nonlinear multi-agent systems in the
   case of normal networks. Then, a novel adaptive neural network
   (NN)-based observer is proposed to observe decayed and intermittent
   transmission signals of networks in such a way to recover the original
   signals. Based on the adaptive control and NN-based observer schemes,
   distributed security control strategies are developed to achieve the
   bounded consensus of the multi-agent systems under the influence of
   network decay and intermittent attacks. The efficiency of the designed
   adaptive security control strategies are illustrated by a multiple
   coupled nonlinear forced pendulum system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {As to support the mission of Mars exploration in China, automated
   onboard planning is required to enhance the security and robustness of
   deep space probes. Onboard planning here is a term that defines a
   complex set of activities or states aiming at deciding the daily tasks
   on a probe and at figuring out if mission goals are met. Deep space
   onboard planning requires modeling of complex operation constraints and
   focusing on intricate state transitions of involved subsystems. Also,
   devices of various operation modes and multiple functionalities, which
   are ubiquitous in physical systems, are intractable in onboard planning
   and have not been effectively handled. To cope with these difficulties,
   we introduce an approach of knowledge representation that explicitly
   establishes the mentioned features. The key techniques we build on are
   the notion of timeline-based planning tasks and heuristic estimate
   method designed on internal state transition graphs. Furthermore, state
   transitions have provided crucial information for search guidance, and a
   search algorithm joint with internal state transition graph heuristic
   method is proposed to avoid redundant work. Finally, we run
   comprehensive experiments on selected domains, and our techniques
   present an excellent performance compared to the algorithm in Europa2.},

Abstract = {The transportation system is gradually migrating toward autonomous,
   electric and intelligent vehicles. Wireless-enabled vehicles along with
   infrastructure units on the road are connected with traffic management
   centers that use intelligent data analysis tools to efficiently manage
   city's traffic. However, such wireless connectivity can make the ITS
   networks vulnerable to security threats; thus, impacting the
   application's reliability. On the other hand, the use of robust security
   techniques could hamper applications' quality of service (QoS). To
   understand the interplay between these two conflicting requirements,
   this article reviews the security and QoS design challenges in the ITS
   aspect of smart cities. Using an experimental test-bed, we evaluate the
   standard compliant security processing delays, develop an on-line tool
   that presents detailed security benchmark results, and study the impact
   of security on QoS using simulation results. We also discuss how machine
   learning based adaptive signature verification techniques can enhance
   QoS in ITS. We further present future opportunities to optimize the
   security QoS balance for ITS applications.},

Abstract = {The wide use of accelerators such as GPUs necessities their security
   support. Recent works {[}17], {[}33], {[}34] pointed out that directly
   adopting the CPU secure memory design to GPUs could incur significant
   performance overheads due to the memory bandwidth contention between
   regular data and security metadata. In this paper, we analyze the
   security guarantees that used to defend against physical attacks, and
   make the observation that heterogeneous GPU memory system may not always
   need all the security mechanisms to achieve the security guarantees.
   Based on the memory types as well as memory access patterns either
   explicitly specified in the GPU programming model or implicitly detected
   at run time, we propose adaptive security memory support for
   heterogeneous memory on GPUs. Specifically, we first identify the
   read-only data and propose to only use MAC (Message Authentication Code)
   to protect their integrity. By eliminating the freshness checks on
   read-only data, we can use an on-chip shared counter for such data
   regions and remove the corresponding parts in the Bonsai Merkel Tree
   (BMT), thereby reducing the traffic due to encryption counters and the
   BMT. Second, we detect the common streaming data access pattern and
   propose coarsegrain MACs for such stream data to reduce the MAC access
   bandwidth. With the hardware-based detection of memory type (read-only
   or not) and memory access patterns (streaming or not), our proposed
   approach adapts the security support to significantly reduce the
   performance overhead without sacrificing the security guarantees. Our
   evaluation shows that our scheme can achieve secure memory on GPUs with
   low overheads for memory-intensive workloads. Among the fifteen
   memory-intensive workloads in our evaluation, our design reduces the
   performance overheads of secure GPU memory from 53.9\% to 8.09\% on
   average. Compared to the state-of-the-art secure memory designs for GPU
   {[}17], {[}33], our scheme outperforms PSSM by up to 41.63\% and 9.5\%
   on average and outperforms Common counters by 84.04\% on average for
   memory-intensive workloads. We further propose to use the L2 cache as a
   victim cache for security metadata when the L2 is either underutilized
   or suffers from very high miss rates, which further reduces the
   overheads by up to 4\% and 0.65\% on average.},

Abstract = {The mobile computing paradigm has introduced new problems for
   application developers. Challenges include heterogeneity of hardware,
   software, and communication protocols, variability of resource
   limitations and varying wireless channel quality. In this scenario,
   security becomes a major concern for mobile users and applications.
   Security requirements for each application are different, as well as the
   hardware capabilities of each device. To make things worse, wireless
   medium conditions may change dramatically with time, incurring great
   impact on performance and QoS guarantees for the application. Currently,
   most of the security solutions for mobile devices use a static set of
   algorithms and protocols for services such as cryptography and hashes.
   In this work we propose a security service, which works as a middleware,
   with the ability to dynamically change the security protocols used
   between two peers. These changes can occur based on variations on
   wireless medium parameters and system resource usage, available hardware
   resources, application-defined QoS metrics, and desired data ``security
   levels{''}. We compare our solution to some widespread static security
   protocols, demonstrate how our middleware is able to adapt itself over
   different conditions of medium and system, and how it can provide a
   performance gain in the execution of cryptographic primitives, through
   the use of data semantics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Aims In transonic wind tunnel tests, large-amplitude and low-frequency
   vibration is easily produced on the sting which is used to support the
   test model. In that case, the quality of the aerodynamic data obtained
   from the tests would dramatically deteriorate and the security of the
   staffs and instruments would be threatened. This paper aims at
   establishing a multi-modal active damping system, which can realize
   active vibration control of the sting used in wind tunnels. Methods The
   hardware platform of the first-two-order vibration damping system based
   on eight piezoelectric stacks is set up and the realtime control
   software is designed to verify the feasibility and practicability of the
   system. Evaluation of the system is carried out in a 2.4 m x 2.4 m
   transonic wind tunnel. Conclusion Using a scaled transport plane as the
   test model, the results show that over 80.6\% reduction of the vibration
   amplitude and 95.6\% energy elimination could be achieved by applying
   this damping system. The success of the system provides an effective way
   to tackle the harmful vibration problems in wind tunnel tests.},

Abstract = {Physical layer security is a cross research hotspot of information
   security and wireless communications. Recently, orbital angular momentum
   (OAM) technology has attracted widespread attention due to its potential
   of improving capacity and spectrum efficiency. However, there are few
   researches on system security based on OAM technology. In this work, we
   studied the security of the proposed OAM wiretap system by applying
   physical layer security theory to OAM communications. Firstly, we
   proposed a uniform circular array-based multi-mode OAM system and
   derived the secrecy capacity. Secondly, the phase profiles, channel
   capacity and received power of OAM beams are analyzed in terms of
   various system parameters in oblique scenarios at 30GHz. Thirdly, we
   discussed the security of the proposed OAM wiretap system. The results
   show that the system using vortex waves is superior to conventional
   communication systems using planar electromagnetic waves in terms of
   system security due to the inherent divergence and spiral phase
   structure of OAM beams. Moreover, we found that the distortion of OAM
   beams during transmission and the center shift at receiving end will
   occur and that system is more stable for high-mode OAM propagation in
   oblique scenarios. This work can provide an effective guidance for the
   research and application of OAM communications.},

Abstract = {Besides the use of analytical programs heuristic knowledge has to be
   applied for an extended optimization of the operating state of a power
   system. The concept for a hybrid expert system is developed which
   performs a search through the space of the feasible operating states.
   With the combination of a standard search algorithm with a production
   system a sophisticated search process is built up. Thereby integrated
   analytical programs provide the knowledge base with quantitative
   informations about the network state and about the effects of control
   actions on the network state.
   An example is given in the application of the expert system for security
   enhancement. The obtained results are presented, followed by a
   comprehensive discussion about the effects of the variation of heuristic
   parameters on the search process.},

Abstract = {With the development of vehicle-to-vehicle
   (V2V)/vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication systems, the spacing
   between two vehicles is shortened effectively and the traffic efficiency
   is improved. Meanwhile, abnormal wireless communication caused by
   time-delay, packet-dropout and failure brings the new traffic security
   problem. In this paper, the connected vehicle platoons is taken as the
   research object. Firstly, a traditional cooperative adaptive cruise
   control (CACC) system is established based on distributed controller;
   secondly, according to the influence of abnormal wireless communication,
   a multi-mode switching control model is presented to improve the CACC
   controller; thirdly, according to the conditions of string stability,
   the ranges of controller parameters and constant time headway (CTH) are
   obtained; finally, the feasibility of the controller is simulated based
   on Matlab/Simulink. The test results show that the multi-mode CACC
   controller can not only avoid the influence of abnormal communication on
   intelligent connected vehicle platoon, but also ensure the string
   stability under the smaller driving spacing in the meantime.},

Abstract = {Real-time assessment and prediction of dynamic security plays an
   important role in power systems operation and control. Analysis of the
   current operating state and prediction of plausible future insecurity is
   crucial for real-time decision-making and implementation of necessary
   control strategies to ensure secure operation of bulk power systems.
   On-line security assessment demands low complexity and computational
   time. The traditional methods of assessment of dynamic security of
   electric power systems often prove to be inadequate for online and
   real-time conditions due to their high complexity and long computation
   time. This article proposes a pattern recognition approach to dynamic
   security analysis for large and complex power systems using ensemble
   decision tree to form reliable decision rules for fast and accurate
   prediction of power system's operating states in a real-time and on-line
   environment. An ensemble security predictor (ENSP) was developed and
   trained to act as ``dynamic security state predictor{''} to predict and
   classify power system's dynamic operating states into secure, insecure,
   and intermediate transitional classes. Two different case studies were
   performed on IEEE 118-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems to evaluate and
   compare the performance of the proposed method on systems of varying
   size and complexity. While prediction accuracy of some of the
   single-learner classifiers decreased considerably when implemented on a
   large sized system, the performance of ENSP declined marginally, and the
   results were acceptable for very large sized systems.},

Abstract = {Biometrics relates to the use of physiology and/or behaviour to
   determine or verify the identity of individuals. Despite the advantages
   of these biometric systems over traditional authentication systems that
   use passwords and ID cards, they are still vulnerable to specific
   limitations that can significantly degrade their functionality. The
   confidentiality of biometric data must be protected to ensure the
   privacy of users, while security mechanisms are necessary to ensure this
   protection. The system's resistance to attacks can also be overcome by
   multimodal biometrics. Multibiometrics consists in concatenating
   multiple biometric data to improve authentication performance.
   Unfortunately, even well-established multi-biometric systems suffer from
   vulnerabilities, the most crucial elements being the biometric models
   that store the user's biometric data. If a user's biometrics is
   compromised, a person's identity and privacy are also compromised, since
   it is impossible to revoke or reissue the biometric template. Therefore,
   secure and revocable multi-biometric templates protection schemes are
   required to ensure multi-biometric system integrity and user privacy.
   This article presents a revocable multi-biometric scheme to secure
   multi-biometric data and focusses on the BioHashing method which is a
   recent technique capable of addressing the reversal of the
   confidentiality and security problem.},

Abstract = {Model-driven architecture (MDA) supports model-centred software
   development via successive model transformation. In MDA, the reusability
   of models is improved as well as the traceability of requirements.
   Agent-oriented model-driven architecture (AMDA) associates adaptive
   agents with a business-oriented interaction model and lets agents
   dynamically interpret their behaviour from the continuously maintained
   model via which the current business needs are deployed at runtime. The
   continuous re-interpretation rather than discrete re-transformation of
   models means immediate requirements deployment after re-configuration,
   no system down time being required to affect changes and results in a
   development process that is oriented to business experts rather than
   developers. Adopting the adaptive agent model, an AMDA paradigm, we put
   forward a security-aware model-driven mechanism by using an extension of
   the role-based access control (RBAC) model. For this purpose, the
   concept or agent role proposed in agent-oriented software engineering
   (AOSE) is integrated with the one proposed in RBAC. Agent duties are
   specified in an interaction model and describe the roles that agents can
   play to fulfil their functional responsibilities. Agent rights are
   specified in a security policy rule model attached to the interaction
   model and describe constraints upon agent capabilities caused by their
   associated social roles. The role based interaction and policy-driven
   model incorporates both agent rights and duties. Hence, functional
   requirements and non-functional security constraint requirements are put
   together, related by the concept of role. Consequently, agents can
   continuously use the re-configurable model to play their roles in order
   to fulfil their responsibilities, and at the same time respect the
   security constraints. The major contribution from the approach is a
   method for building adaptive and secure MAS, following model-driven
   architecture. The approach is illustrated with an actual British railway
   management system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Convolutional neural network with improved feature ranking for robust
   multi-modal biometric system},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {101},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In recent years biometric identification and verification of human
   beings based on their physiological or behavioral characteristics have
   become a trend in security applications. The existing multi-modal
   biometric system (MBS) uses machine learning models for multi class
   classification, but they fail in providing maximum confidentiality,
   security, and accuracy. The proposed work adopts a Deep Learning
   Convolutional Neural Network (DLCNN) approach to implement the robust
   MBS. The proposed system is well trained and tested using four different
   datasets, including biometric images of the face, ear, palm, and finger.
   Initially, noise from the datasets is eliminated using Gabor filtering.
   Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction operations are
   implemented by using the Improved Principal Component Analysis (IPCA)
   technique. Here, IPCA is used for the fusion of four unique biometric
   features with the matching score, and feature ranking is performed using
   the Extended Borda-Count method. Further, DLCNN-based classification is
   used for the recognition of all biometric modalities, which improves the
   robustness and accuracy of the system. The proposed DLCNN-Gabor based
   IPCA technique improves the biometric recognition rate compared to
   existing methods.},

Abstract = {Natural gas pipeline network system is a critical infrastructure
   connecting gas resource and market, which is composed with the
   transmission pipeline system, underground gas storage (UGS) and
   liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal demand. A methodology to assess the
   gas supply capacity and gas supply reliability of a natural gas pipeline
   network system is developed in this paper. Due to random failure and
   maintenance action of the components in the pipeline network system, the
   system can be in a number of operating states. The methodology is able
   to simulate the state transition process and the duration of each
   operating state based on a Monte Carlo approach. After the system
   transits to other states, the actual flow rate will change accordingly.
   The hydraulic analysis, which includes thermal-hydraulic simulation and
   maximum flow algorithm, is applied to analyze the change law of the
   actual flow rate. By combining the hydraulic analysis into the
   simulation of the state transition process, gas supply capacity of the
   pipeline network system is quantified. Furthermore, considering the
   uncertainty of market demand, the load duration curve (LDC) method is
   employed to predict the amount of demand for each consumer node. The gas
   supply reliability is then calculated by comparing the gas supply
   capacity with market demand. Finally, a detailed procedure for gas
   supply capacity and gas supply reliability assessment of a natural gas
   pipeline network system is presented, and its feasibility is confirmed
   with a case study. In the case study, the impact of market demand
   uncertainty on gas supply reliability is investigated in detail.},

Abstract = {Microwave remote sensing technology has played an important role in
   global ocean observation, environmental early warning and maritime
   security. In order to meet the different needs of ocean observation,
   satellites often need to carry multiple remote sensors for detection,
   which causes a serious burden on satellites. Therefore, the parameter
   design method of multi-mode small satellite synthetic aperture radar
   (SAR) system is studied. A single remote sensor in this system can
   realize four working modes of SAR, Altimeter, Spectrometer and
   Scatterometer in time sharing. Since a single remote sensor implements
   four modes of operation in time sharing, it is necessary to fully
   consider the constraints that may be encountered when using the same
   hardware system to implement the four modes of operation. According to
   the parameter design method of multi-mode small satellite SAR system,
   the parameters of radar system in four working modes can be designed.},

Title = {User-Centric Key Entropy: Study of Biometric Key Derivation Subject to
   Spoofing Attacks},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Biometric data can be used as input for PKI key pair generation. The
   concept of not saving the private key is very appealing, but the
   implementation of such a system shouldn't be rushed because it might
   prove less secure then current PKI infrastructure. One biometric
   characteristic can be easily spoofed, so it was believed that
   multi-modal biometrics would offer more security, because spoofing two
   or more biometrics would be very hard. This notion, of increased
   security of multi-modal biometric systems, was disproved for
   authentication and matching, studies showing that not only multi-modal
   biometric systems are not more secure, but they introduce additional
   vulnerabilities. This paper is a study on the implications of spoofing
   biometric data for retrieving the derived key. We demonstrate that
   spoofed biometrics can yield the same key, which in turn will lead an
   attacker to obtain the private key. A practical implementation is
   proposed using fingerprint and iris as biometrics and the fuzzy
   extractor for biometric key extraction. Our experiments show what
   happens when the biometric data is spoofed for both uni-modal systems
   and multi-modal. In case of multi-modal system tests were performed when
   spoofing one biometric or both. We provide detailed analysis of every
   scenario in regard to successful tests and overall key entropy. Our
   paper defines a biometric PKI scenario and an in depth security analysis
   for it. The analysis can be viewed as a blueprint for implementations of
   future similar systems, because it highlights the main security
   vulnerabilities for bioPKI. The analysis is not constrained to the
   biometric part of the system, but covers CA security, sensor security,
   communication interception, RSA encryption vulnerabilities regarding key
   entropy, and much more.},

Title = {An industrial security system for human-robot coexistence},

Year = {2018},

Pages = {220-226},
Abstract = {Purpose - The installation of industrial robots requires security
   barriers, a costly, time-consuming exercise. Collaborative robots may
   offer a solution; however, these systems only comply with safety
   standards if operating at reduced speeds. The purpose of this paper is
   to describe the development and implementation of a novel security
   system that allows human-robot coexistence while permitting the robot to
   execute much of its task at nominal speed.
   Design/methodology/approach - The security system is defined by three
   modes: a nominal mode, a coexistence mode and a gravity compensation
   mode. Mode transition is triggered by three lasers, two of which are
   mechanically linked to the robot. These scanners create a dynamic
   envelope around the robot and allow the detection of operator presence
   or environmental changes. To avoid velocity discontinuities between
   transitions, the authors propose a novel time scaling method.
   Findings - The paper describes the system's mechanical, software and
   control architecture. The system is demonstrated experimentally on a
   collaborative robot and is compared with the performance of a
   state-of-art security system. Both a qualitative and quantitative
   analysis of the new system is carried out.
   Practical implications - The mode transition method is easily
   implemented, requires little computing power and leaves the trajectories
   unchanged. As velocity discontinuities are avoided, motor wear is
   reduced. The execution time is substantially less than a commercial
   alternative. These advantages can lead to economic benefits in
   high-volume manufacturing environments.
   Originality/value - This paper proposes a novel system that is based on
   industrial material but can generate dynamic safety zones for a
   collaborative robot.},

Abstract = {Threat modeling is an analysis activity aimed at eliciting viable and
   realistic security and privacy threats in the design of a
   software-intensive system. Threat modeling allows for a by-design
   approach, mitigating problems before they arise and avoiding later
   costly development efforts.
   However, it mainly pays off in software construction approaches that
   rely on planned architectures, in which sources of threats can be
   anticipated beforehand. These axiomatic assumptions are, however,
   increasingly untrue in contemporary software development practices in
   which software systems evolve drastically in later stages. In addition,
   software-intensive systems are increasingly faced with uncertainty in
   their operational contexts, and these are nearly impossible to enumerate
   in early development stages.
   In this article, we first present the idea of reflective threat
   modeling, which involves the automated derivation of architectural
   system models from run-time and operational system artifacts, providing
   the threat modeler with an accurate and workable run-time inspection
   view of the system. We then outline and motivate the potential of
   adopting threat analysis models as a basis for holistic and adaptive
   threat management through integration of adaptive security and privacy
   technologies. This will enable systems to autonomously respond to
   emerging threats by dynamically activating dedicated controls or via
   run-time reconfiguration.},

Abstract = {A methodology to quantify the gas supply capacity of a natural gas
   transmission pipeline system is developed in this paper. The methodology
   is based on reliability theory and hydraulic analysis of unsteady flow.
   Considering the state transition process and change law of the flow
   rate, two reliability indicators, gas supply satisfaction (S-a) and gas
   supply supportability (S-u), are proposed to quantify the gas supply
   capacity. The methodology is first able to simulate the state transition
   process and the duration of each operating state based on Monte Carlo
   approach, and then the hydraulic analysis of unsteady flow after the
   system transits to others states is applied to analyze the change law of
   the actual flow rate through the commercial software SPS (Stoner
   Pipeline Simulator). By combining the hydraulic analysis into the
   simulation of state transition process, the two reliability indicators
   are calculated. A detailed procedure for gas supply capacity evaluation
   of a natural gas transmission pipeline system is presented, and its
   feasibility is confirmed with two case studies including a hypothesis
   and a real transmission pipeline system. Furthermore, impacts of the
   line pack, availability of the components and the number of stand-by
   units on the gas supply capacity are investigated. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {A substation automation system (SAS) is usually considered binary
   perspective, but majority of the SASs degrade before complete failure,
   they should be considered as a multi-state system (MSS). Therefore, this
   paper proposes a new reliability analysis model for SAS in multi-state
   mode. Unlike conventional binary-state reliability methods, the proposed
   method takes into account the various states of components, which can
   more accurately compute the probabilities of SASs in any states, and
   further meet SAS Delicacy Management, such as wiring type selection,
   maintenance time decision and so on. In this paper, SAS is viewed as a
   network consisting of functional related automation devices (AD), which
   can be described by The Structural Functions and The Correlation
   Matrices. We assess the dynamic element state probabilities of each
   aging multi-state AD using a stochastic process model, which is
   identified as a Markov model. The state distribution of the entire SAS
   is evaluated via the combination of the stochastic process and universal
   generating function. Finally, it takes four typical SAS as an example to
   describe the validity and superiority of the multi-state model in the
   reliability evaluation. This paper also proposes an importance analysis
   model of MSS components to analyze the importance degree of ADs in SAS.},

Abstract = {We introduce an efficient Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE)
   scheme in prime order groups. Our scheme is semi-adaptively secure under
   the decisional linear assumption and supports a large universe of
   attributes and multi-use of attributes. Those properties are critical
   for real applications of KP-ABE schemes since they enable an efficient
   and flexible access control. Prior to our work, existing KP-ABE schemes
   with short ciphertexts were in composite order groups or utilized either
   Dual Pairing Vector Spaces (DPVS) or Dual System Groups (DSG) in prime
   order groups. However, those techniques brought an efficiency loss. In
   this work, we utilize a nested dual system encryption which is a variant
   of Waters' dual system encryption (Crypto' 09) to achieve
   semi-adaptively secure KP-ABE. As a result, we obtain a new scheme
   having better efficiency compared to existing schemes while it keeps a
   semi-adaptive security under the standard assumption. We implement our
   scheme and compare its efficiency with the previous best work.},

   mobile devices, which is able to trade-off between security levels and
   power consumption. The analysis of the influence of different security

   described in detail. Three different security levels with corresponding
   cipher suites are proposed: low, medium and high. The architecture is
   implemented on Android platform. The difference in power consumptions of
   the cipher suites in high and low security/power profiles is around
   8.2\% for WiFi, and 9.6\% for 3G network. In order to further reduce the
   power consumption during network communication, the delay between
   sending two successive packets is analyzed. The proposed architecture is
   capable of stalling packets and sending them in burst-mode, letting the
   network interface to stay in low-power mode for a longer period of time.
   The power consumption in this mode is reduced for additional 25\%.},

Abstract = {The hype over cloud computing cannot go unnoticed even as providers and
   users alike testify of the evident benefits. It also goes without saying
   that this approach to computing shares its own challenges the most
   echoed being security. Security concerns herein, birthed by the exposure
   of the cloud to different threats, continue to cast doubts on potential
   users and it's only befitting that such concerns are addressed. Users
   who entrust their data to the cloud want their data to be secured in the
   strongest terms possible. Once data leaves the user, the onus is on the
   cloud provider to provide the required security since data now lies
   within their perimeter of jurisdiction. But security requirements do
   change with time and this therefore calls for a continuous process of
   evaluating the security status of the cloud system. This paper proposes
   a model of analyzing the security status of the cloud system with
   regards confidentiality, integrity and availability. We employ state
   transitions of a conceptual finite state machine, Boolean algebra and
   logic to evaluate the various states of the system when a specified
   breach occurs. The scope of this paper is limited to user data on the
   cloud and not as it traverses the network between the user and the
   provider.},

Abstract = {Internet protocol security (IPsec) provides real-time IP packets with
   confidentiality security service, making them robust against snooping
   security threats. Conventionally, the security level provided by such
   protocol cannot be modified according to the status of the network. In
   this paper, we propose a security-aware scheduling algorithm for a
   heterogeneous packet switched network. It provides real-time packet
   flows with guaranteed quality of service (QoS) while adaptively controls
   the packet's confidentiality security service level. The proposed scheme
   is modeled using the object-oriented multi-agent methodology. By
   applying a buffer estimation technique at the network's end nodes, the
   algorithm provides a real-time network congestion control hence
   satisfying the network performance metrics. In order to minimize the
   overhead of network association performed by the IPsec, the algorithm
   overloads the priority code point fields of the IEEE 802.1Q tagged frame
   format. This approach helps meet both QoS and security requirements for
   real-time data flows.},

Abstract = {Automotive products, such as electronic control units, evolve
   increasingly towards adaptive solutions. From many perspectives,
   solutions need to be flexible with regards to the entire originating
   process and operation process. Here, the product development cycle, the
   product life-cycle and even product lines describe the dimensions a
   solution might have to adapt to. Certain requirements to secure the
   product continuously add further complexity to the aforementioned
   dimensions. Adversaries adapt - so the protection shall as well.
   However, adapting, particularly, technical solutions to products,
   implies the need for agnostic approaches. In this article, we propose a
   security-risk mitigation concept which aims to fit into the evolving
   automotive originating process applied to a particular class of
   electronic control units. Technically, the proposed approach shuffles
   the system memory-map of an asynchronous multiprocessing system. On the
   intermediate layer between the hardware and software, the assignment of
   memory and resources is obfuscated to a potential adversary who managed
   to breach one of the higher level memory protection mechanisms. As a
   result, the proposed mitigation adds either a further level in a
   defense-in-depth security architecture or fixes a structural
   vulnerability of certain hardware architectures.},

Abstract = {In order to enhance the security of web service as well as to support
   the differentiated service, the paper puts forward an adaptive model,
   which is based on active defense strategy. It uses a network prediction
   model on base of self-similar sequence theory to estimate current states
   of transfer servers in end-system, then classifies them with
   Fuzzy-C-means clustering method. Finally we bring forward a load
   balancing algorithm that is founded on the classification results and
   grading users' requests. In that way, it optimizes the allocation of
   system resources and ensures data security and reliability. Moreover,
   this model, not dependent on the original operating system, is
   transplantable and extensible.},

Abstract = {While traditional security mechanisms rely on preventive controls and
   those are limited in surviving malicious attacks, we propose a novel
   approach to security engineering. The objective is to characterize the
   attacks in real time and survive in face of attacks by using software
   rejuvenation. In this paper we address the critical intrusion tolerance
   problems ahead of intrusion detection. Firstly, the attacks are
   characterized by applying Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and these
   characterized intrusions are analyzed according to their state changes
   by utilizing transient state analysis. Subsequently, the software
   rejuvenation methods are performed by killing the intruders' processes
   in their tracks, halting abuse before it happens, shutting down
   unauthorized connection, and responding and restarting in real time.
   These slogans will really frustrate and deter the attacks, as the
   attacker can't make their progress. This is a way of survivability to
   increase the deterrence level against an attack in the target
   environment.},

Abstract = {On a large-scale application subject to dynamic interactions, the
   description and enforcement of security rules are complex tasks to
   handle, as they involve heterogeneous entities that do not have the same
   capabilities. In the context of SCM-application for example, we have
   different goods that are being transported across different systems. At
   one point, items and systems communicate together to signal presence,
   report issues during transport, certify validity of previous checks,
   etc. Security capabilities of the involved parties are heterogeneous and
   one might want to specify security policies on an abstract level and let
   the involved systems enforce them according to their contexts and the
   specific capabilities of each party. In this paper, we propose a
   framework for security mechanisms adaptation when services are involved
   by using Aspect-Oriented-Programming (AOP) concepts that can be applied
   to SCM applications. The novelty is the expressivity of security policy
   at a global level and the enforcement at a local level, through a
   specific and distributed aspect model that has a larger semantic to
   catch up events relevant for business usage and dedicated to security
   concerns.},

Abstract = {One of the primary research challenges in Attribute-Based Encryption
   (ABE) is constructing and proving cryptosystems that are adaptively
   secure. To date the main paradigm for achieving adaptive security in ABE
   is dual system encryption. However, almost all such solutions in
   bilinear groups rely on (variants of) either the subgroup decision
   problem over composite order groups or the decision linear assumption.
   Both of these assumptions are decisional rather than search assumptions
   and the target of the assumption is a source or bilinear group element.
   This is in contrast to earlier selectively secure ABE systems which can
   be proven secure from either the decisional or search Bilinear
   Diffie-Hellman assumption. In this work we make progress on closing this
   gap by giving a new ABE construction for the subset functionality and
   prove security under the Search Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption. We
   first provide a framework for proving adaptive security in
   Attribute-Based Encryption systems. We introduce a concept of ABE with
   deletable attributes where any party can take a ciphertext encrypted
   under the attribute string x is an element of \{0, 1\}(n) and modify it
   into a ciphertext encrypted under any string x is an element of \{0, 1
   perpendicular to\}(n) where x' is derived by replacing any bits of x
   with perpendicular to symbols (i.e. ``deleting{''} attributes of x). The
   semantics of the system are that any private key for a circuit C can be
   used to decrypt a ciphertext associated with x' if none of the input
   bits read by circuit C are perpendicular to symbols and C(x') = 1. We
   show a pathway for combining ABE with deletable attributes with
   constrained pseudorandom functions to obtain adaptively secure ABE
   building upon the recent work of Tsabary {[}30]. Our new ABE system will
   be adaptively secure and be a ciphertext-policy ABE that supports the
   same functionality as the underlying constrained PRF as long as the PRF
   is ``deletion conforming{''}. Here we also provide a simple constrained
   PRF construction that gives subset functionality. Our approach enables
   us to access a broader array of Attribute-Based Encryption schemes
   support deletion of attributes. For example, we show that both the Goyal
   et al. (GPSW) {[}19] and Boyen {[}6] ABE schemes can trivially handle a
   deletion operation. And, by using a hardcore bit variant of GPSW scheme
   we obtain an adaptively secure ABE scheme under the Search Bilinear
   Diffie-Hellman assumption in addition to pseudo random functions in NC1.
   This gives the first adaptively secure ABE from a search assumption as
   all prior work relied on decision assumptions over source group
   elements.},

Abstract = {Dynamic systems cause challenges for security because it is impossible

   is an applicable solution for this challenge. It is able to
   automatically select security mechanisms and their parameters at runtime

   environment. In this paper we describe an approach detailing key steps
   and activities to create an adaptive security solution. The architecture
   conforms to the MAPE-K reference model, which is a widely applied
   reference model in autonomic computing. Steps include: Establishing a
   control point to force control of the security decision process from the
   existing system. Identifying an environment parameter with which the
   security will trade off. Studying the interrelationship between security
   and the environment parameter in the existing system context by
   identifying measurable factors which influence their relationship.
   Formulation of a trade-off goal which is optimised based on multiple
   objectives, one of which is a security objective. Consequently, the
   proposed approach is capable of deploying mechanisms adaptive security

Title = {A security modeling and verification method of embedded software based
   on Z and MARTE},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {88},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The existing modeling and verification methods for embedded software are
   insufficient towards the increasingly prominent security requirements.
   In this paper, aiming at high security requirements of embedded
   software, a security modeling and verification framework of embedded
   software based on semiformal and formal methods is proposed. An
   extensible security model ZMsec (Z-MARTE security model), which extends
   Z with elements of MARTE (Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and
   Embedded systems) and FSA (Finite State Automata), is presented to
   describe three dimensions of software: security usecases, static
   structures and dynamic behaviors. Further on, this paper designs ZMsecTL
   (ZMsecTemporal Logic) formulas to describe security properties, and
   proposes ZMCA (ZMsec Model Checking Algorithm), a security model
   checking algorithm on ZMsec model, to verify security properties in
   ZMsecTL formulas. In order to provide an intuitive state transition
   diagram for model checking, a depth-first ZMsecSD (ZMsecState Diagram)
   generation algorithm is designed. Drawing on the abstract framework,
   this paper develops a prototype implementation of ZMV (ZMsec Modeling
   and Verification tool), a tool for ZMsec integrated with modeling and
   verification phases. We finally discuss an embedded software example
   with ZMV, which illustrates and validates the security modeling and
   verification method proposed in this paper. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The classification of power system operating states plays an important
   role in power system control and operation. Determining the state of a
   power system is crucial and requirements for real-time decision making
   in power system security assessment demand low dimensionality and low
   computational time. This paper investigates the benefits of using
   feature selection based on mutual information in power system state
   classification with machine learning. The AdaBoost algorithm is used for
   classification based on large training datasets and feature selection is
   applied in order to reduce their dimensionality. The selection is

Abstract = {Controllers for software defined networks (SDNs) are quickly maturing to
   offer network operators more intuitive programming frameworks and
   greater abstractions for network application development. Likewise, many
   security solutions now exist within SDN environments for detecting and
   blocking clients who violate network policies. However, many of these
   solutions stop at triggering the security measure and give little
   thought to amending it. As a consequence, once the violation is
   addressed, no clear path exists for reinstating the flagged client
   beyond having the network operator reset the controller or manually
   implement a state change via an external command. This presents a burden
   for the network and its clients and administrators. Hence, we present a
   security policy transition framework for revoking security measures in
   an SDN environment once said measures are activated.},

Title = {Real-time multi-state classification of short-term voltage stability

Abstract = {The analysis of the significant amount of data collected by PMU devices
   in wide-area monitoring, protection and control (WAMPAC) applications
   has been a great challenge for assessing power system fast phenomena.
   This paper presents a novel methodology for real-time assessment of
   short-term voltage stability (STVS) under large disturbances with an
   approach based on data mining and machine learning. This methodology
   classifies off-line the power system stability in multiple operating
   states through the calculation of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and
   dynamic voltage indices. This allows identifying not only fast voltage
   collapses (FVC) but also fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR)
   events. The multivariate time series data of the power system dynamic
   response are processed and transformed with a symbolic representation
   technique. This together with the operating state classification are
   used to train an intelligent machine based on Random Forest proposed for
   applying in real time to classify the post-disturbance operating state.
   This methodology is tested in the New England 39-bus system. The
   performance of the methodology to classify the STVS in real time was
   verified, obtaining a classification error less than 2\% using a
   post-contingency data window of 0.58 s and less than one-third of all
   the bus voltage measurements. Results show the ability of the
   methodology to predict voltage stability problems, having enough time to
   carry out automatic control actions to prevent or mitigate problems.},

Abstract = {User authentication on smartphones is the key to many applications,
   which must satisfy both security and convenience. We propose a
   multi-modal face authentication system, which pushes the limit of
   state-of-the-art image based face recognition solutions by incorporating
   a new dimension of sensing modality - acoustics. It actively emits
   almost inaudible acoustic signals from the earpiece speaker to
   ``illuminate{''} the user's face and extracts features from the echoes
   using a customized convolutional neural network, which are fused with
   sophisticated visual features extracted from state-of-the-art face
   recognition models, for secure face authentication. Because the echo
   features depend on 3D facial geometries and material, our multi-modal
   design is not easily spoofed by images or videos like image based face
   recognition systems. It does not require any special sensors thus
   eliminating the extra costs in solutions like FaceID. Experiments show
   that our design achieves comparable face recognition performance to the
   state-of-the-art image based face authentication, while able to block
   image/video spoofing.},

Abstract = {In threshold cryptography, private keys are divided into n shares, each
   one of which is given to a different server in order to avoid single
   points of failure. In the case of threshold public-key encryption, at
   least t <= n servers need to contribute to the decryption process. A
   threshold primitive is said robust if no coalition of t malicious
   servers can prevent remaining honest servers from successfully
   completing private key operations. So far, most practical
   non-interactive threshold cryptosystems, where no interactive
   conversation is required among decryption servers, were only proved
   secure against static corruptions. In the adaptive corruption scenario
   (where the adversary can corrupt servers at any time, based on its
   complete view), all existing robust threshold encryption schemes that
   also resist chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA) till recently require
   interaction in the decryption phase. A specific method (in composite
   order groups) for getting rid of interaction was recently suggested,
   leaving the question of more generic frameworks and constructions with
   better security and better flexibility (i.e., compatibility with
   distributed key generation).
   This paper describes a general construction of adaptively secure robust
   non-interactive threshold cryptosystems with chosen-ciphertext security.
   We define the notion of all-but-one perfectly sound threshold hash proof
   systems that can be seen as (threshold) hash proof systems with publicly
   verifiable and simulation-sound proofs. We show that this notion
   generically implies threshold cryptosystems combining the aforementioned
   properties. Then, we provide efficient instantiations under well-studied
   assumptions in bilinear groups (e.g., in such groups of prime order).
   These instantiations have a tighter security proof and are indeed
   compatible with distributed key generation protocols.},

Abstract = {Security is concerned with the protection of assets from intentional
   harm. Secure systems provide capabilities that enable such protection to
   satisfy some security requirements. In a world increasingly populated
   with mobile and ubiquitous computing technology, the scope and boundary
   of security systems can be uncertain and can change. A single functional
   component, or even multiple components individually, are often
   insufficient to satisfy complex security requirements on their own.
   Adaptive security aims to enable systems to vary their protection in the
   face of changes in their operational environment. Collaborative
   security, which we propose in this paper, aims to exploit the selection
   and deployment of multiple, potentially heterogeneous,
   software-intensive components to collaborate in order to meet security
   requirements in the face of changes in the environment, changes in
   assets under protection and their values, and the discovery of new
   threats and vulnerabilities.
   However, the components that need to collaborate may not have been
   designed and implemented to interact with one another collaboratively.
   To address this, we propose a novel framework for collaborative security
   that combines adaptive security, collaborative adaptation and an
   explicit representation of the capabilities of the software components
   that may be needed in order to achieve collaborative security. We
   elaborate on each of these framework elements, focusing in particular on
   the challenges and opportunities afforded by (1) the ability to capture,
   represent, and reason about the capabilities of different software
   components and their operational context, and (2) the ability of
   components to be selected and mediated at runtime in order to satisfy
   the security requirements. We illustrate our vision through a
   collaborative robotic implementation, and suggest some areas for future
   work.},

Abstract = {Poor design has been a major source of software security problems.
   Rigorous and designer-friendly methodologies for modeling and analyzing
   secure software are highly desirable. A formal method for software
   development, however, often suffers from a gap between the rigidity of
   the method and the informal nature of system requirements. To narrow
   this gap, this paper presents a UML-based framework for modeling and
   analyzing security threats (i.e. potential security attacks) rigorously
   and visually. We model the intended functions of a software application
   with UML statechart diagrams and the security threats with sequence
   diagrams, respectively. Statechart diagrams are automatically converted
   into a graph transformation system, which has a well-established
   theoretical foundation. Method invocations in a sequence diagram of a
   security threat are interpreted as a sequence of paired graph
   transformations. Therefore, the analysis of a security threat is
   conducted through simulating the state transitions from an initial state
   to a final state triggered by method invocations. In our approach,
   designers directly work with UML diagrams to visually model system
   behaviors and security threats while threats can still be rigorously
   analyzed based on graph transformation.},

Abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) have entirely revolutionized the industry.
   However, the cyber-security of IoT enabled cyber-physical systems is
   still one of the main challenges. The success of cyber-physical system
   is highly reliant on its capability to withstand cyberattacks. Biometric
   identification is the key factor responsible for the provision of secure
   cyber-physical system. The conventional unimodal biometric systems do
   not have the potential to provide the required level of security for
   cyber-physical system. The unimodal biometric systems are affected by a
   variety of issues like noisy sensor data, non-universality,
   susceptibility to forgery and lack of invariant representation. To
   overcome these issues and to provide higher-security enabled
   cyber-physical systems, the combination of different biometric
   modalities is required. To ensure a secure cyber-physical system, a
   novel multi-modal biometric system based on face and finger print is
   proposed in this work. Finger print matching is performed using
   alignment-based elastic algorithm. For the improved facial feature
   extraction, extended local binary patterns (ELBP) are used. For the
   effective dimensionality reduction of extracted ELBP feature space,
   local non-negative matrix factorization is used. Score level fusion is
   performed for the fusion. Experimental evaluation is done on FVC 2000
   DB1, FVC 2000 DB2, ORL (AT\&T) and YALE databases. The proposed method
   achieved a high recognition accuracy of 99.59\%.},

Title = {A Novel Multi-Mode Bayesian Method for the Process Monitoring and Fault
   Diagnosis of Coal Mills},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {22914-22926},
Abstract = {Process monitoring and fault diagnosis (PM-FD) of coal mills are
   essential to the security and reliability of the coal-fired power plant.
   However, traditional methods have difficulties in addressing the strong
   nonlinearity and multi-modality of coal mills. In this paper, a novel
   multi-mode Bayesian PM-FD method is proposed. Gaussian mixture model
   (GMM) is first applied to identify the operating modes of the coal mill.
   Subsequently, combined with multi-output relevance vector regression
   (MRVR), Bayesian inference is introduced to reconstruct and monitor the
   newly observed samples from different running modes. Additionally, the
   squared prediction error and the contribution plot method are employed
   for fault detection and isolation. The performance of the proposed PM-FD
   method is verified through its application in a self-defined nonlinear
   system and two actual fault cases of a medium-speed coal mill. Compared
   with the traditional methods, the experimental results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we describe three different state space models for
   analyzing the security of a software system. In the first part of this
   paper, we utilize a semi-Markov Process (SNIP) to model the transitions
   between the security states of an abstract software system. The SNIP
   model can be solved to obtain the probability of reaching security
   failed states along with the meantime to security failure (MTTSF). In
   the second part of the paper, we use a discrete event dynamic system
   model of security dynamics. We show how to derive events and transitions
   from existing security taxonomies. We then apply theory of discrete
   event control to define safety properties of the computer system in
   terms of the basic concepts of controllability used in discrete event
   control for two special sub-languages K-S and K-V. These languages
   correspond to maximally robust controllable sub-languages. In the third
   approach, we show that by associating cost with the state transitions,
   the security quantification problem can be casted as Markov decision
   problem (MDP). This MDP can be solved to obtain an optimal controllable
   language K-S({*}) subset of K-S the gives the minimal cost safe security
   policy.},

Abstract = {The need for stringent security and accurate identification is to a
   large extent accomplished by multi-modal biometric systems. These
   systems counter-verify the identity using more than one biometrics. In
   this paper we have used three hand-based biometric viz. fingerprint,
   palmprint and finger knuckle print. The main advantage of this system is
   ease of acquiring biometric and hence high user's acceptability.
   Individual transforms like DCT, Walsh, Kekre and Haar and their
   combinations resulting in hybrid transforms, hybrid two resolution
   wavelets and hybrid multi-resolution wavelets have been applied to each
   biometric. Frier{*}, compaction of these transforms and wavelets has
   been used to generate feature vectors. Both open set and closed set
   experiments have been performed on partial fingerprint database and
   palmprint and finger-knuckle print databases from Hong Kong polyu and
   plots of efficiency of closed set and receiver operating characteristics
   of open set have been generated. With 100\% efficiency for hybrid
   multi-resolution wavelet with combination of Walsh-Kekre and 0\% Equal
   Error Rate (EER) and 100\% Security Parameter Index (SPI) for hybrid
   multi-resolution wavelet with combination of Walsh-DCT and Haar-DCT,
   this method is best suitable for applications with relatively smaller
   database.},

Abstract = {Autonomous vehicles are a research area of active interest. Collision
   avoidance system (CAS) is one of the central concerns to provide
   security protection for autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a
   multi-mode collision avoidance system (mCAS), which combines a
   trajectory prediction module, a risk assessment module and a motion
   planning module into the closed-loop system. At each step, the
   trajectory prediction module predicts the trajectories of the vehicle
   and surrounding vehicles. The risk assessment model calculates the
   collision probability and chooses reasonable control mode. Then the
   motion planning module designs the desired deceleration profile based on
   it. The car takes the first step of the planned deceleration and repeats
   this cycle, achieving closed-loop control. The mCAS is tested in a
   closed-loop simulation setup and the results show that the proposed mCAS
   is of good effectiveness and feasibility, which can significantly reduce
   collision probability as well as false alarms.},

Title = {Power system probabilistic security assessment using Bayes classifier},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},

Volume = {74},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper presents a method for power system security assessment based
   on the Bayes classifier. This method can be applied to calculate
   probabilistic security indices as well as on-line security assessment.
   In general, the determination of security breach is a cumbersome and
   time-consuming process due to dynamic and steady-state effects. These
   effects can be incorporated by considering transient stability,
   satisfaction of system load without violation of constraints, and
   voltage stability studies. The variation of the system load, as well as
   contingencies, may cause system transition to a different operating
   state. It is impractical if not impossible to evaluate all these
   situations, such as contingencies resulting from load variation. The
   straightforward Monte Carlo simulation, one of the possible methods in
   power system reliability analysis, requires the evaluation of a system
   operating state for each sampled state and is computation-intensive. In
   the proposed method, first the joint probability density of feature
   vectors has been obtained by using some training data. Once this joint
   distribution is obtained, the Bayes classifier provides the assessment
   of system security without complicated contingency analyses and can
   reduce the computational burden. Security status of a given feature
   vector can be determined by a posteriori probability rule called Bayes
   rule, which can be implemented in on-line security assessment or power
   system reliability studies. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a wearable multi-modal user interface design and
   its implementation for a teleoperated field robot system. Recently some
   teleoperated field robots are employed for hazard environment
   applications (e.g. rescue, explosive ordnance disposal, security). To
   complete these missions in outdoor environment, the robot system must
   have appropriate functions, accuracy and reliability. However, the more
   functions it has, the more difficulties occur in operation of the
   functions. To cope up with this problem, an effective user interface
   should be developed. Furthermore, the user interface is needed to be
   wearable for portability and prompt action. This research starts at the
   question: how to teleoperate the complicated slave robot easily. The
   main challenge Is to make a simple and intuitive user interface with a
   wearable shape and size. This research provides multi-modalities such as
   visual, auditory and haptic sense. It enables an operator to control
   every functions of a field robot more intuitively. As a result, an EOD
   (explosive ordnance disposal) demonstration is conducted to verify the
   validity of the proposed wearable multi-modal user interface.},

Abstract = {There are many types of security that have been applied to secure
   Electronic Commerce nowadays. Mainstream security depends on
   equipment-based security mechanisms, which are a concern in terms of

   Electronic Commerce has increased as a result of the whole process and
   the devices used. This thesis proposes an appropriate security
   management system TDM which is enforced security management system for

   that of the Internet. An analysis of the existing system is used in
   order to suggest appropriate next-generation security management for XML

Title = {Secure and flexible economic data sharing protocol based on ID-based
   dynamic exclusive broadcast encryption in economic system},

Abstract = {Sharing economic data is paramount for improving quality and developing
   more efficient ways to produce statistics, and making better economic
   decisions. The economic data is of great importance to the corporations
   and governments, and they must be protected against the outsiders.
   Unfortunately, in an economic administration system, a few users may be
   malicious, or they are at high risk to leak information to the
   outsiders. Therefore, the economic data must also be protected against
   these users. The traditional broadcast encryption can provide protected
   data sharing among honest users. However, it is not efficient when most
   of the users are honest, and only a small amount of users are malicious.
   The traditional method is not cost effective, and does not fit to the
   situation where the set of malicious users dynamically changes either.
   Meanwhile, in traditional broadcast encryption, the authorized users'
   identities need to be sent with the ciphertext. The valid users'
   anonymity is not provided. To solve these problems, in this work, we
   present a novel cryptographic primitive, i.e. ID-based Dynamic Exclusive
   Broadcast Encryption (IBDEBE), and based on a hybrid framework (the
   combination of the exponent-inversion framework and the
   commutative-blinding framework) we propose an IBDEBE scheme with
   constant-size private keys and ciphertexts. The IBDEBE scheme is proved
   to be semi-adaptively semantically secure in the random oracle model. By
   applying the IBDEBE scheme, a secure economic data sharing protocol is
   devised, which is efficient and flexible in dynamic honest user groups,
   and it provides good security properties, i.e. source authenticity, data
   integrity protection, data access control, resistance to collusion
   attack and anonymity. We evaluate the performance of our solution with
   experiments and the results show good computation efficiency. (C) 2018

Abstract = {The wide deployment of biometric verification systems has also unveiled
   security and privacy issues. Among other vulnerabilities, presentation
   attacks directed to the capture device pose a severe security threat.
   That is, a gummy finger (known as presentation attack instrument, PAI)
   can be used to impersonate another subject and thereby gain illegal
   access to the system. To prevent such attacks, presentation attack
   detection (PAD) techniques have been proposed in the last decade. For
   the particular case of fingerprints, most approaches are based on
   conventional optical or capacitive sensors, acquiring a single image,
   and which can thus detect only a limited number of PAIs. In this work,
   we present a new multi-modal PAD approach based on a recently developed
   capture device, which is able to acquire four different types of
   samples: i) finger photos, ii) finger vein samples, iii) multi-spectral
   short wave infrared images, and iv) laser speckle contrast image
   sequence samples. Different ad-hoc algorithms have been developed for
   each set of images. The experimental evaluation over 35 PAIs, part of
   them used only at the test stage, shows the efficiency of the proposed
   approach in a realistic scenario, with an APCER of 6.6\% for a BPCER of
   0.2\%.},

Abstract = {Deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance on object
   detection tasks with RGB data. However, there are many advantages of
   detection using multi-modal imagery for defence and security operations.
   For example, the IR modality offers persistent surveillance and is
   essential in poor lighting conditions and 24hr operation. It is,
   therefore, crucial to create an object detection system which can use IR
   imagery. Collecting and labelling large volumes of thermal imagery is
   incredibly expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, we propose to
   mobilise labelled RGB data to achieve detection in the IR modality. In
   this paper, we present a method for multi-modal object detection using
   unsupervised transfer learning and adaptation techniques. We train
   faster RCNN on RGB imagery and test with a thermal imager. The images
   contain object classes; people and land vehicles and represent real-life
   scenes which include clutter and occlusions. We improve the baseline
   F1-score by up to 20\% through training with an additional loss
   function, which reduces the difference between RGB and IR feature maps.
   This work shows that unsupervised modality adaptation is possible, and
   we have the opportunity to maximise the use of labelled RGB imagery for
   detection in multiple modalities. The novelty of this work includes; the
   use of the IR imagery, modality adaption from RGB to IR for object
   detection and the ability to use real-life imagery in uncontrolled
   environments. The practical impact of this work to the defence and
   security community is an increase in performance and the saving of time
   and money in data collection and annotation.},

Abstract = {In this paper we discuss ongoing work in an ambitious DARPA funded
   effort to develop new ways of achieving cyber security. The broad
   approach taken by the project is for the network to be self-aware and to
   self-adapt in order to dodge attacks. After all attempts to avoid attack
   have been applied, some attacks will still get through. In critical
   systems, it is not always the best or practical thing to do to shut down
   the network under attack. In this paper we describe how trust in cyber
   assets can be modeled and used to support self-adaptive techniques in
   continuing to operate important computational functions in a network
   that is actively under attack. The paper, in particular describes the
   trust modeling system that attempts to maintain a model of trust for
   networked resources using a combination of two basic ideas: Conditional
   trust (based on conditional preference (CP-Nets) and the principle of
   maximum entropy (PME).},

Abstract = {Secure communication is critical in military environments in which the
   network infrastructure is vulnerable to various attacks and compromises.
   A conventional centralized solution breaks down when the security
   servers are destroyed by the enemies. In this paper we design and
   evaluate a security framework for multilevel ad hoc wireless networks
   with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In battlefields, the framework
   adapts to the contingent damages on the network infrastructure.
   Depending on the availability of the network infrastructure, our design
   is composed of two modes. In infrastructure mode, security services,
   specifically the authentication services, are implemented on UAVs that
   feature low overhead and flexible managements. When the UAVs fail or are
   destroyed, our system seamlessly switches to infrastructureless mode, a
   backup mechanism that maintains comparable security services among the
   surviving units. In the infrastructureless mode, the security services
   are localized to each node's vicinity to comply with the ad hoc
   communication mechanism in the scenario. We study the instantiation of
   these two modes and the transitions between them. Our implementation and
   simulation measurements confirm the effectiveness of our design.

Abstract = {We propose an RFID-based ALE Application Framework (AAF) providing
   context-aware security services, which could dynamically adapt security
   policies. From the proposed framework, we can construct RFID application
   fast and efficiently through general, reusable, and extensible API due
   to the software reusability. The proposed model consists of an adaptive
   security level algorithm based on MAUT and Simple Heuristics. The
   security level algorithm could adopt diverse security services according
   to the contextual information in the network environment. Therefore, the
   proposed model is expected to provide more flexible security management
   in the heterogeneous network environments.},

Abstract = {The Network Access Control (NAC) management is a critical task,
   especially in current networks that are composed of many heterogeneous
   things (Internet of Things) connected to share data, resources and
   Internet access. The Software-Defined Networking (SDN) simplifies the
   network design and operation, and offers new opportunities
   (programmability, flexibility, dynamicity, and standardization) to
   manage the network. Despite this, the access control management remains
   a challenge, once managing security policies involves dealing with a
   large set of access control rules, detecting conflicting policies,
   defining priorities, delegating rights, and reacting against network
   state changes and events. This work presents the HACFlow, a novel,
   autonomic, and policy-based framework for access control management in
   OpenFlow networks. HACFlow aims to simplify and automate the network
   management allowing network operators to govern rights of network
   entities by defining dynamic, fine-grained, and high-level access
   control policies. We analyzed the performance of HACFlow and compared it
   against related approaches.},

Abstract = {The challenge for any security screening system is to identify
   potentially harmful objects such as weapons and explosives concealed
   under clothing. Classical border and security checkpoints are no longer
   capable of fulfilling the demands of today's ever growing security
   requirements, especially with respect to the high throughput generally
   required which entails a high detection rate of threat material and a
   low false alarm rate. TeraSCREEN proposes to develop an innovative
   concept of multi-frequency multi-mode Terahertz and millimeter-wave
   detection with new automatic detection and classification
   functionalities. The system developed will demonstrate, at a live
   control point, the safe automatic detection and classification of
   objects concealed under clothing, whilst respecting privacy and
   increasing current throughput rates. This innovative screening system
   will combine multi-frequency, multi-mode images taken by passive and
   active subsystems which will scan the subjects and obtain complementary
   spatial and spectral information, thus allowing for automatic threat
   recognition.
   The TeraSCREEN project, which will run from 2013 to 2016, has received
   funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under the
   Security Call.
   This paper will describe the project objectives and approach.},

Title = {Dynamic Security Metrics for Software-Defined Network-based Moving
   Target Defense},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {170},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {We propose a suite of dynamic security metrics that timely, dynamically,
   and adaptively assess the effectiveness of the software-defined network
   (SDN)-based moving target defense (MTD) techniques. The security metrics
   are developed to measure the dynamics of a network and a host state's
   information (e.g., IP address, port, software stacks, vulnerabilities,
   or network topology) introduced by various types of MTD techniques
   shuffling them. The key aspect of our proposed metrics is to capture
   variability that keeps track of changing patterns of the network and the
   host states upon every MTD triggering event. In this work, we propose
   the following security metrics capturing the variability based on the
   changes made by the MTD: (1) Network and host address-based metrics
   measuring variability of the network and host addresses based on a
   degree of uncertainty and unpredictability on the assigned IP address to
   the hosts in a network; (2) Attack path-based metrics measuring
   variability of attack paths using graphical models estimated based on
   the network state transitions from one topology to another topology upon
   triggering a network topology and/or IP shuffling MTD; and (3) Attack
   stage-based success metrics measuring the chances of discovering a
   vulnerable target host's information, exploiting the target host's
   vulnerability, and compromising the target host. Via extensive
   simulation study, we investigated the key parameters that can
   significantly affect the MTD performance based on the proposed security
   metrics. Our simulation results show that the metrics are viable to
   measure the effectiveness of deploying the MTD techniques.},

Title = {An Asynchronous AAA Blockchain-Based Protocol for Configuring
   Information Systems},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The increasing number of security breaches in centralized systems
   provides the necessity to introduce decentralization in more fields. The
   Blockchain is a widely utilized decentralization technology that is
   implemented in various industries. Therefore, this technology can be
   used to protect sensitive services, such as those associated with the
   configuration changing of information systems. This article proposes a
   new protocol operating as a decentralization layer over any
   configuration scheme. It uses smart contracts-programs existing on the
   Blockchain-to keep track of configuration proposals and authorize new
   configurations. The configuration change can be proposed at any time.
   However, only once it is authorized by appropriate parties can it be
   introduced to the system. The new protocol provides an additional
   security layer, ensuring that every action is accounted for and
   authenticated. Furthermore, it enforces that administrators authorize
   every change. The protocol was designed to be flexible and easily
   adaptable to scenarios that did not use distributed ledger technology
   before. It uses the HTTP protocol with the JSON standard for protocol
   messages to allow easier adoption and transparency. The features of the
   proposed protocol were analyzed from a security point of view as well as
   from the financial perspective related to costs of using Blockchain
   technology. Security analysis shows that the protocol is resilient to
   the most common security risks that haunt state-of-the-art IT systems.
   Additionally, the authors proved that this solution could be implemented
   in both private and public Blockchains. A reference implementation was
   shared in a public repository. The proposed protocol was also compared
   with the most similar state-of-the-art work in the academic research
   highlighting the key differences and improvements.},

Title = {Modeling adaptive security-aware task allocation in mobile cloud
   computing},
Journal = {SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {116},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Security is one of the most important criteria in the management of
   cloud resources. In Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), secure allocation of
   tasks remains challenging due to the limited storage, battery life and
   computational power of mobile devices connected to the core cloud
   cluster infrastructure. Secure wireless communication channels and
   protocols for protecting the data and information sent to the cloud, and
   remote access to secure cloud services, are other important problems
   related to task scheduling and processing in dynamic MCC. In this paper,
   we developed a new security-aware task allocation model strategy in
   Mobile Cloud Computing. In this model, we define an allocation algorithm
   which generates an optimal and secure configuration of communication
   protocols in order to meet the specific data confidentiality
   requirements defined by end users. Resource utilization is predicted
   using Machine Learning methods, and the optimal secure service for task
   execution is selected. We developed a simulation environment (MocSecSim)
   for the evaluation of the algorithms proposed in several scenarios based
   on the users' requirements. The results of simulations and experiments
   have demonstrated that the model proposed significantly improves the
   level of security of calculations in comparison with a configuration
   where processing time and energy consumption are the main criteria for
   optimizing task allocation.},

Abstract = {HomeServer is developed to play the pivotal role of managing all home
   devices and multimedia content services through home networks. The
   possibility of a single user input device and single security agent to
   serve all the needs of the home is conventional to cope with the new
   technology revolution. The Home Server has to be enhanced to facilitate
   multi-modal inputs with multiple integrated user agents working together
   to facilitate all users at home. Processing of multiple input agents for
   dynamic context-aware output facilitates the system to learn adaptively
   using a probabilistic inference mechanism. We devise a hybrid
   collaboration architecture using fuzzy and neural agents to enhance our
   system operation to the trends of next generation home user
   requirements. Security in such a dynamic infrastructure is challenging.
   We devise mobile agents at each interface input device to manage
   multiple users using Mobile Agent Digital Signatures to dynamically
   adapt to the context. The mobile agents are defined to operate the tasks
   on any mobile or stationary home device and collect the information
   needed for the HomeServer. The system adapts to dynamically changing
   user requirements and security context and produces the output based on
   the user's context.},

Abstract = {For the purpose of developing smart control with a great degree of
   flexibility to enhance the stability, security and self-healing
   capability of a high-penetration distribution grid, in this study smart
   control called a hierarchical hybrid control is proposed based on
   operational mode conversions of distributed energy resources.
   Corresponding to the hybrid dynamic behaviours of the system, the
   hierarchical hybrid control consists of discrete control strategies at
   the upper level, local continuous controllers at the lower level and
   their interactions. The upper level discrete control strategies are
   mainly responsible for switching operational modes so as to enhance
   security and self-healing capability during significant disturbances.
   The lower level continuous control aims to regulate dynamic stability of
   each controlled unit in order to obtain satisfactory performance. The
   effectiveness of the proposed hybrid control is demonstrated through
   simulation examples.},

Title = {Anonymous spatial encryption under affine space delegation functionality
   with full security},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {277},
Pages = {715-730},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Anonymous encryption provides the decrypter's identity privacy
   preservation as well as plaintext confidentiality. Spatial encryption,
   which is a kind of functional encryption, provides a generalized
   framework for special property encryption schemes such as broadcast
   encryption, predicate encryption, forward secure encryption,
   (hierarchical) identity-based encryption, delegatable attribute-based
   encryption etc. In this paper, we propose an anonymous spatial
   encryption scheme that deploys an affine subspace delegation mechanism.
   Our proposed scheme captures the message confidentiality, recipient
   anonymity, adaptive security, partial-order delegation and short
   ciphertext, simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed
   scheme is the first anonymous spatial encryption that provides the
   anonymity property in adaptive security model, whose construction is
   based on a dual system encryption mechanism in bilinear composite-order
   groups. We also give a conversion construction to move into a
   prime-order setting with canceling property, whose security is based on
   the Decision Linear Problem. Finally, we provide a transformation
   methodology to obtain a CCA-secure scheme that combines a one-time
   signature, delegation functionality and the CPA-secure scheme. (C) 2014

Title = {Enhancement in reliability-constrained unit commitment considering

Journal = {IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION \& DISTRIBUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {24, SI},

Abstract = {The high penetration of uncertain resources challenges the security of
   power system operation. By taking the impact of rescheduling under
   contingencies into consideration, reliability-constrained unit
   commitment (RCUC) is developed to address this challenge. Although
   several efforts have been made in modelling reliability constraints, the
   existing methods can only manage oversimplified low-order
   temporal-independent contingencies without considering wide-range
   contingencies or their state-transition-process issue. To quantify the
   impact of rescheduling on the normal-state scheduling process denoted by
   UC problem, this paper builds up a Bayesian inference method for
   encoding reliability constraints in wide-range temporal-dependent
   contingencies. Three predictors, for example,
   expected-generator-rescheduling-power, expected-energy-not-serviced and
   lost-of-load-probability, are selected to describe the possible
   corrective behaviours in rescheduling process and quantified by using
   Bayesian inference method. Then, these predictors are reformatted as a
   set of linearized constraints to be incorporated into UC. The proposed
   RCUC comprehensively considers the effect of rescheduling in wide-range
   temporal-dependent contingencies. Therefore, it can reveal the influence
   of generator rescheduling in wide-range contingencies and keep better
   reliability performance than those methods reported in previous RCUC
   studies. The modified IEEE 30-bus test system and IEEE 118-bus test
   system are used to show the proposed model's effectiveness.},

   distribution factors, the credible critical contingency states can be
   identified from the full possible operating states to form the effective
   contingency-set. Compared to the traditional method of solving the
   probabilistic optimal dispatching problem with fixed steady probability
   and full contingency-set, the probability forecasting precision of the
   credible contingency states and the model computation efficiency have
   been improved significantly by this proposed algorithm. Finally, the
   analysis of the IEEE-30 test system shows that the proposed algorithm is
   reasonable and effective.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present the implementation of a multi-mode
   crypto-coprocessor, which can support three different public-key
   cryptography (PKC) engines (NTRU, TTS, Pairing) used in post-quantum and
   identity-based cryptosystems. The PKC-based security protocols are more
   energy-efficient because they usually require less communication
   overhead than symmetric-key-based counterparts. In this work, we propose
   the first-of-its-kind tri-mode PKC coprocessor for secured data
   transmission in Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. For the purpose of low
   energy consumption, the crypto-coprocessor incorporates three design
   features, including 1) specialized instruction set for the multi-mode
   cryptosystems, 2) a highly parallel arithmetic unit for cryptographic
   kernel operations, and 3) a smart scheduling unit with intelligent
   control mechanism. By utilizing the parallel arithmetic unit, the
   proposed crypto-coprocessor can achieve about 50\% speed up. Meanwhile,
   the smart scheduling unit can save up to 18\% of the total latency. The
   crypto-coprocessor was implemented with AHB interface in TSMC 90nm CMOS
   technology, and the die size is only 1.96 mm(2). Furthermore, our chip
   is integrated with an ARM-based system-on-chip (SoC) platform for
   functional verification.},

Abstract = {A power network can be divided into several operating states in terms of
   the degree to which adequacy and security constraints are satisfied in
   the reliability evaluation of a composite generation and transmission
   system. The two most popular approaches for power system reliability
   evaluation namely contingency enumeration and Monte Carlo simulation
   have been combined to form a hybrid model to analyze these operating
   states in order to provide a quantitative assessment of system risk.
   Both annualized and annual indices obtained using a seven-step load
   model are presented for two test systems. Selection methods are used to
   detect problem creating contingencies. A linear programming model for
   generation rescheduling, minimization of the amount of load shed and
   correction of the voltage problem and Q-load curtailment is utilized
   with the hybrid model. Variance reduction techniques have been
   investigated in order to reduce the computation time and to improve the
   simulation results.},

Abstract = {Power system operation aims, in principle, at maintaining reliable and
   secure supply of electricity while minimizing the total cost of
   operation. In theory, there are two main objectives that could be
   considered, namely the maximization of system security and the
   minimization of total operating cost of supplying energy. In practice,
   however, the security requirements are included as constraints rather
   than formulating the problem as a security maximization mandate. The
   system security constraints are in fact boundaries that surround all
   possible operating modes (scenarios) of the power system. In other
   words, these boundaries form the feasible operating domain - in the
   parameter space spanned by various operating variables - within which
   the system can safely be operated. For a given operating scenario, the
   associated security level is measured by the ``distance{''} (for
   example, the Euclidean norm) of the operating point from the security
   region boundary. This paper presents a novel framework for
   identification and representation of operating security regions in power
   systems as well as evaluation of security levels associated with
   different operating scenarios. While the concepts and principles
   presented are general, the work of this the paper is confined to the
   interpretation of the security boundary in terms of system stability
   criteria. Of course, the framework presented is applicable quite as well
   to other criteria that may be considered.},

Title = {Challenges in threat modelling of new space systems: A teleoperation

Abstract = {A growing number of adversaries are targeting space missions, and as
   such, there have been increasing academic and industrial efforts in
   identifying threats and risks through modelling techniques. In parallel,
   the research communities are collaborating to lower the entry barriers
   for space activities to deliver more innovative and cost-effective space
   missions. This evolution has been termed as New Space. However, this
   transformation of the space ecosystem has led to changes in the threat
   landscape, introducing new threat vectors and threat actors intent on
   compromising space systems and missions. As a result, it is expected
   that cyber threats could increase against space systems. Furthermore,
   teleoperation, a significant use case for building extraterrestrial
   habitats, has already been shown vulnerable in other domains as well.
   For example, teleoperated robots developed for remote surgery have been
   shown to be vulnerable to threats, such as malicious control due to an
   elevation-of-privilege attack. Threat modelling is a systematic and
   structured method to determine associated system vulnerabilities,
   possible attack entry points and vectors, and potential impacts on the
   system. In this work, we examine the efficacy of the de facto threat
   modelling methods such as STRIDE/DREAD in capturing highly adaptive
   security requirements and threats from a system-centric perspective for
   the teleoperation mission scenario. Understanding and protecting these
   hardware-software assets and their interaction in the mission is of
   foremost importance since security breaches threaten human safety across
   the broader New Space ecosystem. This research presents the limitations
   of existing threat modelling approaches in capturing hardware-software
   interaction in space systems, which is an open area for scientific
   enquiry. Moreover, research challenges are raised to improve the safety
   and security of the teleoperation mission. The output of this work can
   then be used to develop more appropriate threat modelling approaches to
   support security requirement engineering for different New Space mission
   scenarios.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of COSPAR.},

Abstract = {Developers and academics are constantly seeking to increase the speed
   and security of operating systems. Unfortunately, an increase in either
   one often comes at the cost of the other. In this paper, we present an
   operating system design that challenges a long-held tenet of multicore
   operating systems in order to produce an alternative architecture that
   has the potential to deliver both increased security and faster
   performance. In particular, we propose decoupling the operating system
   kernel from user processes by running each on completely separate
   processor cores instead of at different privilege levels within shared
   cores. Without using the hardware's privilege modes, virtualization and
   virtual memory contexts enforce the security policies necessary to
   maintain process isolation and protection. Our new kernel design
   paradigm offers the opportunity to simultaneously increase both
   performance and security; utilizing the hardware facilities for
   inter-core communication in place of those for privilege mode switching
   offers the opportunity for increased system call performance, while the
   hard separation between user processes and the kernel provides several
   strong security properties.},

Abstract = {A low-end embedded platform for Internet of Things (IoT) often suffers
   from a critical trade-off dilemma between security enhancement and
   computation overhead. We propose PUFSec, a new device fingerprint-based
   security architecture for IoT devices. By leveraging intrinsic hardware
   characteristics, we aim to design a computationally lightweight security
   software system architecture so that complex cryptography computation
   can dramatically be prohibited. We exploit the innovative idea of Public
   Physical Unclonable Functions (PPUFs) that fundamentally protects
   attackers from recovering the secret key from public gate delay
   information. We implement its hardware logic in a real-world FPGA board.
   On top of the PPUF fingerprint hardware, we present an adaptive security
   control mechanism consisting of adaptive key generation and key exchange
   protocol, which adjusts security strength depending on system load
   dynamics. We demonstrate that our PPUF FPGA implementation embeds
   distinctive variability enough to distinguish between two different
   PPUFs with high fidelity. We validate our PUFSec architecture by
   implementing necessary algorithms and protocols in a real-world IoT
   platform, and performing empirical evaluation in terms of computation
   and memory usages, proving its practical feasibility.},

Abstract = {Computational intelligence firmly made its way into the areas of
   consumer applications, banking, education, social networks, and
   security. Among all the applications, biometric systems play a
   significant role in ensuring an uncompromised and secure access to
   resources and facilities. This article presents a first multimodal
   biometric system that combines KINECT gait modality with KINECT face
   modality utilizing the rank level and the score level fusion. For the
   KINECT gait modality, a new approach is proposed based on the skeletal
   information processing. The gait cycle is calculated using three
   consecutive local minima computed for the distance between left and
   right ankles. The feature distance vectors are calculated for each
   person's gait cycle, which allows extracting the biometric features such
   as the mean and the variance of the feature distance vector. For Kinect
   face recognition, a novel method based on HOG features has been
   developed. Then, K-nearest neighbors feature matching algorithm is
   applied as feature classification for both gait and face biometrics. Two
   fusion algorithms are implemented. The combination of Borda count and
   logistic regression approaches are used in the rank level fusion. The
   weighted sum method is used for score level fusion. The recognition
   accuracy obtained for multi-modal biometric recognition system tested on
   KINECT Gait and KINECT Eurocom Face datasets is 93.33\% for Borda count
   rank level fusion, 96.67\% for logistic regression rank-level fusion and
   96.6\% for score level fusion.},

Title = {Computational Security for Context-Awareness in Vehicular Ad-Hoc
   Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {4},
Pages = {5268-5279},
Abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc networks can be viewed as a typical context-aware
   system where the experienced context frequently varies as vehicles move
   along road, e.g., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), velocity, and traffic
   flow. In particular, the adopted security protection mechanisms often
   depend on the node state, location, and/or surrounding risk, which need
   the capability of context-aware security quantification. This paper
   views the security level as a user's inherent property that is only
   correlated with the user's behaviours and the situated context and
   independent of the suffered attack ways. We propose a formalized
   methodology to especially quantify the security level in real time from
   the perspective of state transition probability through estimating the
   stable probability of staying in the security state in inhomogeneous
   continuous time Markov chain. This paradigm enables users to customize
   the security protection mechanisms for adapting to the frequently
   varying context. We conduct the extensive numerical calculations and
   empirical analysis to comprehensively investigate the response of the
   proposed security quantification framework to the various combinations
   of the concerned parameters, e.g., SNR, velocity, and traffic flow. The
   results show that the proposed framework is capable of capturing the
   real-time security level adaptively to the vehicular context and
   provides a dependable decision basis to security protection, which can
   restrict the security to a target value.},

Abstract = {In dynamic and risk-prone environments, security rules should be
   flexible enough to permit the treatment of risks, and to manage
   privileges on resources based on the situation at hand. For this
   purpose, we define safety-centric contexts based on risk description
   that is provided by the safety management system. This paper presents a
   risk-adaptive access control model that adopts hierarchies of contexts
   and security domains to make adaptations to risks at different levels of
   criticality. Since various risks may arise simultaneously, two or more
   security domains might be applicable at the same time incorporating
   various security rules which might lead to conflicts. Therefore, an
   approach to analyze conflicts is essential. In this work, we propose a
   conflict analysis algorithm based on set theory and we illustrate its
   usage with the proposed risk-adaptive access control model.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a wearable multi-modal user interface design and
   its implementation for a teleoperated field robot system. Recently some
   teleoperated field robots are employed for hazard environment
   applications (e.g. rescue, explosive ordnance disposal, security). To
   complete these missions in outdoor environment, the robot system must
   have appropriate functions, accuracy and reliability. However, the more
   functions it has, the more difficulties occur in operation of the
   functions. To cope up with this problem, an effective user interface
   should be developed. Furthermore, the user interface is needed to be
   wearable for portability and prompt action. This research starts at the
   question : how to teleoperate the complicated slave robot easily. The
   main challenge is to make a simple and intuitive user interface with a
   wearable shape and size. This research provides multi-modalities such as
   visual, auditory and haptic sense. It enables an operator to control
   every functions of a field robot more intuitively. As a result, an EOD
   (explosive ordnance disposal) demonstration is conducted to verify the
   validity of the proposed wearable multi-modal user interface.},

   Also, a multi-mode control system is proposed based on the constant

   multi-mode system switching threshold, a comprehensive investigation on
   the vehicle dynamic performances is performed. According to the
   simulation results, it can be found that a 10.77\% decrement of body
   acceleration can be reached under the comfort mode compared with
   comprehensiveness mode. Apart from that, tire dynamic load under
   security mode drops by 17.43\% and theoretical energy-regenerative power
   under energy-feedback mode increases by 19.48\%. The conclusion proves

Journal = {SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {214},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {In software engineering, formal methods are often used to specify and
   verify design models of software products. Whether design models are
   consistent with required properties can significantly impact the quality
   of final software products. In this work, we study B model quality
   measurements based on the ISO/IEC 25010 standard. These measurements are
   formulated as domain-independent formulae and computed by model
   checking. Moreover, we study how to enable machines to automatically
   solve unreachable goals in B models. We suggest to use constraint
   solvers and semantic learners to discover state transitions to the
   goals. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the model repair technique, a
   set of experiments are conducted based on the model quality
   measurements. The results demonstrate that the model repair technique
   can solve unreachable goals while preserving the quality of models. (C)

Abstract = {Recent changes in the dynamic characteristics of security and emergency
   management requirements have a big impact on the development of more
   effective security systems. Innovative solutions have to provide support
   for new security challenges and newly developed operational strategies.
   Widely used security concepts based on video sensor solutions are being
   replaced by high-performance multi-sensor systems, which allow
   monitoring of outdoor areas with various sizes independent of lighting
   and weather conditions. Apart from the sensors used, the system
   effectiveness depends on innovative automatic data analysis including AI
   methods to enable generation of a comprehensive near real-time
   representation of a given situation.
   This work describes a concept and an experimental prototype of a
   self-sufficient, independent multi-sensor system for monitoring of
   critical personal behavior in the context of events, border area
   surveillance and critical infrastructure monitoring. The specific
   security scenarios were defined and worked out in detail in close
   cooperation with security experts. In order to ensure 24/7 operational
   capability, the work focuses on a flexible sensor platform concept and
   includes optical, thermal and radar sensors which are synergistically
   employed. Furthermore, innovative approaches to multi-sensor Al-based
   data analysis and web-based mobile information management solutions were
   developed as part of the nationally funded research project WatchDog to
   enable a targeted, scenario oriented support of the security forces.},

Abstract = {Market surveillance systems have increasingly gained in usage for
   monitoring trading activities in stock markets to maintain market
   integrity. Existing systems primarily focus on the numerical analysis of
   market activity data and generally ignore textual information. To fulfil
   the requirements of information-based surveillance, a multi-agent-based
   architecture that uses agent intercommunication and incremental learning
   mechanisms is proposed to provide a flexible and adaptive inspection
   process. A prototype system is implemented using the techniques of text
   mining and rule-based reasoning, among others. Based on experiments in
   the scalping surveillance scenario, the system can identify target
   information evidence up to 87.50\% of the time and automatically
   identify 70.59\% of cases depending on the constraints on the available
   information sources. The results of this study indicate that the
   proposed information surveillance system is effective. This study thus
   contributes to the market surveillance literature and has significant

Title = {An Adaptive, Situation-Based Risk Assessment and Security Enforcement
   Framework for the Maritime Sector},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Maritime processes involve actors and systems that continuously change
   their underlying environment, location and threat exposure. Thus, risk
   mitigation requires a dynamic risk assessment process, coupled with an
   adaptive, event driven security enforcement mechanism, to efficiently
   deal with dynamically evolving risks in a cost efficient manner. In this
   paper, we propose an adaptive security framework that covers both
   situational risk assessment and situational driven security policy
   deployment. We extend MITIGATE, a maritime-specific risk assessment
   methodology, to capture situations in the risk assessment process and
   thus produce fine-grained and situation-specific, dynamic risk
   estimations. Then, we integrate DynSMAUG, a situation-driven security
   management system, to enforce adaptive security policies that
   dynamically implement security controls specific to each situation. To
   validate the proposed framework, we test it based on maritime cargo
   transfer service. We utilize various maritime specific and generic
   systems employed during cargo transfer, to produce dynamic risks for
   various situations. Our results show that the proposed framework can
   effectively assess dynamic risks per situation and automate the
   enforcement of adaptive security controls per situation. This is an
   important improvement in contrast to static and situation-agnostic risk
   assessment frameworks, where security controls always default to
   worst-case risks, with a consequent impact on the cost and the
   applicability of proper security controls.},

Abstract = {Power transmission line insulator is an important part for power system
   security. Because insulator has complex operating environment and its
   infection factors interact on each other, the diagnosis of insulator
   running state is very difficult. It is needed to use some useful
   information to conclude insulator operating state. ANFIS networks have
   strong knowledge expressing, fuzzy reasoning and learning ability, which
   is used to diagnose insulator operating state in this paper. In order to
   improve the knowledge gain ability for ANFIS, two ways both neural
   networks learning and GAs optimizing are combined together to train
   optimized reasoning parameters in reasoning rules training. The new
   improved quick GA is designed to train parameters based on the character
   of inference system. Experiment results show that the designed ANFIS
   network has strong reasoning and learning ability, which can diagnose
   insulator operating state unfailingly. These techniques used in this
   paper are quite effective in expert diagnosis system.},

Abstract = {Providing satisfactory security services in mobile ad hoc network
   (MANET) is indispensable to their mission critical applications;
   however, often a highly secure mechanism inevitably consumes a rather
   large amount of system resources, which in turn may unintentionally
   cause a security provisioning denial-of-service (SPDoS) attack. To avoid
   SPDoS attack, a framework is presented to design a resource-aware
   self-adaptive network security provisioning scheme for the resource
   constraint MANET. With the support of the offline optimal secure
   protocol selection module and the online self-adaptive security control
   module, the framework is capable of deploying different combinations of
   secure protocols to satisfy different security needs at different
   conditions for different applications. Consequently, the proposed
   self-adaptive security provisioning achieves the maximum overall network
   security services and network performance services, without causing the
   SPDoS attack. Moreover, it provides additional security capability via
   security services hopping.},

Abstract = {A solar-absorption refrigerating system using the solar energy as the
   driving power is an energy efficiency system, which is also friendly to
   the environment. However, as the solar radiation varies with the season,
   the day and night and the climate, the solar energy supplying to the
   system is unsteady, which affects the security and the stability of the
   system. Here a typical solar-absorption refrigerating system is put
   forward to. Then the operating conditions in summer and their operating
   performance are discussed. Different operating modes are chosen
   according to the cooling loads and the weather. Automatic control system
   is used to keep the whole system operating steadily. Finally a survey is
   carried out. The operating record indicates that it is reasonable to
   adopt different operating mode in different case. This will provide the
   reference for the design and operation management of the solar-ab
   sorption refrigerating system.},

Abstract = {In this paper we propose feasibility demonstration of twin-field quantum
   key ditribution system based on multi-mode weak coherent phase-coded
   states. Their utilization provides indisputable advantages described in
   the paper. We also provide the detailed description of nontrivial
   interference scheme for those states and derive detection and quantum
   bit error rates. Since we propose the feasibility scheme we present in
   this paper only asymptotic secure key estimation and show that in
   principle it can beat well-known fundamental limit of repeaterless
   quantum communications , i.e., the secret key capacity of the lossy
   communication channel. Also we present here the experimental setup and
   provide the experimental values of detection rates dependence on the
   modulation signals phase difference. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America

   Hence to provide safety and security system for bike riders we came up
   with a solution which is a Helmet Operated Smart E-Bike. It is having
   two operating modes which are Security Lock System (SLS) and Safety
   Engine System (SES), the first operating mode (SLS) having one RFID
   reader and two RFID tags. When a particular unique identity tag matches
   to the RFID reader value the handle lock mechanism will be operates like
   ON \& OFF key. The second operating mode (SES) uses Force Sensing
   Resistor (FSR) which is fixed inside to the helmet and when some
   pressure applied on the sensor by helmet wearing on the user head, the
   motor (Engine) will be starts otherwise motor will be in off state.
   Hence the proposed solution provides accidents free society and high
   security locker system, this multiple featured smart E Bike vehicles
   leads user towards pollution free and accidents free society.},

Abstract = {Wireless sensor network (WSN) is an integral part of Internet of Things
   (IoT). The sensor nodes in WSN generate large sensing data which is
   disseminated to intelligent servers using multiple wireless networks.
   This large data is prone to attacks from malicious nodes which become
   part of the network, and it is difficult to find these adversaries. The
   work in this paper presents a mechanism to detect adversaries for the
   IEEE 802.15.4 standard which is a central medium access protocol used in
   WSN-based IoT applications. The collisions and exhaustion attacks are
   detected based on a soft decision-based algorithm. In case the QoS of
   the network is compromised due to large data traffic, the proposed
   protocol adaptively varies the duty cycle of the IEEE 802.15.4.
   Simulation results show that the proposed intrusion detection and
   adaptive duty cycle algorithm improves the energy efficiency of a WSN
   with a reduced network delay.},

Abstract = {The switches between a non-privileged application and the OS kernel
   running in the CPU's supervisor mode have been inducing performance
   costs despite manufacturer efforts to provide special instructions for
   such transition. Software that heavily interacts with the underlying OS
   (e.g., I/O intensive and event-driven applications) suffers from system
   call overhead. To deteriorate this situation, security vulnerabilities
   in modern processors have prompted kernel mitigations that further
   increase the transition overhead. Particularly system-call-heavy
   applications have been reported to be slowed down by up to 30\% with
   kernel page-table isolation (KPTI), the widely deployed mitigation for
   the Meltdown vulnerability. To decouple system calls from mode
   transitions, we revisit an old idea known as system-call hatching or
   multi-calls: the bundling of system calls into a combined call, which
   only incurs the mode-transition costs of a single one. And then, we have
   implemented ESCA scheme to adapt system-call hatching to Linux-based
   servers in the light of Meltdown and Spectre, effectively eliminating
   the slowdown of KPTI-affected applications. Our evaluation shows that
   the throughputs of real-world applications, benefiting from MCA, can be
   improved with only 2 lines of code changed respectively: Nginx by up to
   12\%, lighttpd by up to 23\%, and Redis by 4\%. Meanwhile, using
   aggregated transitions, our approach allows faster system calls
   interleaved with full compatibility but without requiring Linux kernel
   patches.},

Abstract = {Biometric user authentication techniques for security and access control
   have evoked an enormous interest by science, industry and society in the
   last two decades. Scientist and researchers have constantly pursued the
   technology for automated confirmation of the identity of subjects based
   on measurements of physiological or behavioral traits of humans. But
   even the best single biometric system suffers from spoof attacks,
   intra-class variability, noise, susceptibility etc. To address this
   issue, we develop a hybrid multibiometric system which integrates
   multi-algorithm and multi-modal approaches of multibiometric system and
   use bi-level fusion to combine biometric information. We use face, ear
   and signature biometric traits which are first classified by three
   classification techniques-multilayer perceptron, Fisherimage and
   Bayesian network. The outcomes of these classifiers for face are fused
   by rank fusion method. Outcomes for ear and signature are also fused
   similarly. The second level fusion occurs when we combine the results of
   these three rank fusion methods' outcomes for face, ear and signature
   with decision fusion method. We use Borda count and Borda fuse
   approaches for rank fusion and majority voting, weighted majority voting
   and behavioral knowledge space approaches for decision fusion. The final
   results indicate that this hybrid multi biometric system outperforms the
   single biometric systems build on the same data using the same
   classification algorithms. This system can be effectively used in law
   enforcement or homeland security department or for commercial purposes.},

Abstract = {Recently, the need for techniques for quantification of security
   attributes of IKT systems has been raised. This relates both to security
   requirements in QoS architectures as well as input to trade-off analysis
   regarding the design and choice of security mechanisms to comply with an
   established security policy. Early research in this area has focused on
   state transition models, such as Markov or semi-Markov models. In the
   dependability domain these techniques are used to measure values much as
   mean time between failures (MTBF), and to quantify frequency and
   consequences of risks. The dynamics of security attacks makes it
   intractable to use, due to the problems with state explosions.To be able
   to express the complete state space of a security critical system, one
   needs to consider not only hardware, operating system, and
   application/services faults, but also the survivability of the system in
   terms of intentional and accidental security breaches. In this paper, we
   build a stochastic prediction system to estimate the system integrity of
   a security critical system. We make use of Colored Petri Nets (CPN), a
   higher-level-formal-ism for stochastic modeling, analysis, and
   simulation. The prediction system is implemented as a generic and
   hierarchic CPN model.},

Abstract = {Mode transition plays an important role in the operation of hybrid
   electric vehicles. The clutch is a key actuator for mode transition, but
   friction resulting from its use makes it difficult to achieve seamless
   mode transition. Moreover, as is usual in an electromechanical coupling
   system, the hybrid powertrain may exhibit complex dynamic behaviours as
   operating parameters change during mode transition. This paper
   considered changes in the clutch friction coefficient, and established a
   mathematical model of the hybrid powertrain in a parallel-series hybrid
   electric vehicle (PSHEV) during mode transition. The Routh-Hurwitz
   criterion and bifurcation theory are introduced to analyse the influence
   of speed difference on the dynamic characteristics of the hybrid
   powertrain, and the corresponding instability threshold were given.
   Furthermore, an optimised adaptive control methodology was proposed to
   control the dynamic behaviours, and tests on PSHEV were carried out. The
   results show that the variations of speed difference may lead to the
   occurrence of Fold and Hopf bifurcations, and that once the speed
   difference reaches the instability threshold, it may cause the system to
   enter a chaotic state and exhibit random oscillation. The proposed
   control methodology can effectively expand the security domain and
   suppress the oscillation to improve smoothness of mode transition.},

Title = {Context-Aware Security for Vehicles and Fleets: A Survey},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {101809-101846},
Abstract = {Vehicles are becoming increasingly intelligent and connected. Interfaces
   for communication with the vehicle, such as WiFi and 5G, enable seamless
   integration into the user's life, but also cyber attacks on the vehicle.
   Therefore, research is working on in-vehicle countermeasures such as
   authentication, access controls, or intrusion detection. Recently, legal
   regulations have also become effective that require automobile
   manufacturers to set up a monitoring system for fleet-wide security
   analysis. The growing amount of software, networking, and the automation
   of driving create new challenges for security. Context-awareness,
   situational understanding, adaptive security, and threat intelligence
   are necessary to cope with these ever-increasing risks. In-vehicle
   security should be adaptive to secure the car in an infinite number of
   (driving) situations. For fleet-wide analysis and alert triage,
   knowledge and understanding of the circumstances are required.
   Context-awareness, nonetheless, has been sparsely considered in the
   field of vehicle security. This work aims to be a precursor to
   context-aware, adaptive and intelligent security for vehicles and
   fleets. To this end, we provide a comprehensive literature review that
   analyzes the vehicular as well as related domains. Our survey is mainly
   characterized by the detailed analysis of the context information that
   is relevant for vehicle security in the future.},

Abstract = {One of the foundational elements of the Next Generation Air
   Transportation System (NextGen) Secure Airspace concept is the flight
   security risk assessment. This risk assessment is continually performed
   and updated based on changes to security-related information pertaining
   to a particular flight, as well as changes to the security environment
   external to the flight; e.g., other flights, airports, and airspace.
   This dynamic risk assessment is part of the NextGen layered, adaptive
   security concept in which technologies, policies, and procedures are
   adaptively scaled and deployed to counter a particular threat. This
   paper describes key information concepts for dynamic flight security
   risk assessment.},

Abstract = {The great enthusiasm which accompanies the wide adoption of handled
   devices and remote services is very often attenuated by the number and
   frequency of security problems encountered by users and services
   providers. The ubiquitous (pervasive) nature of such applications has
   brought new security vulnerabilities. Security in pervasive computing is
   thus, still a hot topic.
   Context-based security is an emerging approach for modeling adaptive
   security solutions based on the situation of use of the system. Our
   contribution aims at presenting a new model for specifying context-based
   security policies. This approach is based on contextual graphs and
   relies on a set of contextual information collected from the system and

Abstract = {The Internet of connected Vehicles (IOV) can collect, process, compute
   and release the information of intelligent transportation systems. IOV
   is an integrated service system that can support the applications for
   automatic driving, intelligent transport and information services. As
   the number of incidents on IOV has been on the rise in the past few
   years, IOV security is becoming increasingly important in the IOV
   architecture. One of the most notable risks of IOV faces is intelligent
   terminal security. The vehicle's intelligent terminal can be used to
   launch for further attacks on the on-board operating system to penetrate
   into the internal network of connected vehicle, and consequently
   threaten the safety of the vehicle. Thus, it is of paramount importance
   that we protect the security of the intelligent terminal. We propose two
   intelligent terminal based privacy-preserving multi-modal implicit
   authentication protocols to protect the security of the intelligent
   terminal in IOV. The proposed protocols use the password and the vehicle
   owner's behavior features as the authentication factors to protect the
   security of the intelligent terminal. Since the vehicle owner's behavior
   features are sensitive and the privacy information of the user must be
   protected, we also consider the privacy protection of the behavior
   features. Our protocols do not reveal any information about the vehicle
   owner's behavior features to the authentication server and the adversary
   except the ciphertext size of the feature vector. We analyze the
   security of our proposed protocol and compare them with other related
   protocols in terms of computation and communications costs. Our results
   demonstrate that our proposed protocols yield better security and
   efficiency.},

Abstract = {Illegal software manipulation is one of the biggest issues in software
   security. This includes the legally relevant software which are now
   crucial modules in weight and measuring instruments such as
   weighbridges. Despite the advancement and complexity of weight and
   measuring instruments, the inspection methodology is weak and lacks of
   innovation. The conventional inspection method is merely based on the
   observation printed certificate of the software. This paper introduces
   Malaysia Software-Assisted Non-Automatic Weighing Instrument (NAWI)
   Inspection (MySANI), a method used to enhance the software inspection
   scheme in legal metrology. MySANI introduces security objects in order
   to assist and enhance the inspection process. The security evaluation is
   based on the best practices in IT in metrology, where the attack model
   on relevant assets of the security objects is simulated for the Attack
   Probability Tree. The attack tree is verified by integrating formal
   notation and comparison with finite state transition system domain to
   verify the correctness properties of the tree design before the model
   can be further used in a risk analysis procedure within the Attack
   Probability Tree framework. Results show that the designed attack tree
   is consistent with the designed simulation.},

Abstract = {Although security and privacy by design underpin effective engineering
   of software intensive systems, the dynamic reality of modern information
   systems means that such systems are the subject of changes of many
   different forms that can affect their operational environment, their
   behaviour, and the behaviour of their users, both legitimate and
   malicious. Systems must therefore be adaptive by design, in order to
   adapt effectively at runtime. In particular, these systems must be able
   to adapt their security and privacy controls, both proactively or in
   response to a variety of changes in their environment, in the threats
   they face, and in the assets they are required to protect. This talks
   presents both empirical and engineering challenges to achieving adaptive
   security and privacy in information systems. Acknowledging that
   information systems are increasingly both socio-technical and
   cyber-physical,the talk explores the impact of cyber-physical-social
   boundaries and their effective management when engineering secure,
   privacy-aware, and forensics-ready systems.},

   calculate the reliability indices based on the events that lead to load
   curtailment. These indices do not reflect whether or not a system is on
   the edge of being in trouble. A power system, however, operates under
   different degrees of stress anti strain throughout a period. This paper
   presents an approach to quantify a power network into several operating
   states in terms of the degree to which adequacy and security constraints
   are satisfied. The probabilistic indices calculated in this paper to
   quantify the power network at bulk load points and at system level
   reflect the actual operating behaviour of a power system. The algorithm
   proposed can be easily incorporated in any composite system reliability
   model that uses enumeration technique for reliability evaluation.},

Abstract = {Power system security analyses as well as decisions made to preserve
   system security are all on the basis of an approximate insight over the
   system status. This approximate insight is provided based on erroneous
   measurements throughout the system. The error in the input data may
   result in a misleading index which either increases system operating
   costs or jeopardizes service continuity. This paper aims at establishing
   an step-by-step algorithm to study impacts of error in measurements on
   system security indices. Two different security indices representing
   under voltage severity and over load severity are studied in this paper.
   The proposed algorithm has three major steps. In the first step, typical
   measurements are sampled according to the system operating state and
   randomly generated errors. This is done using Monte Carlo sampling
   approach. The second step is to extract an approximate model of the
   system true state which is done via state estimators. Then, security
   indices are calculated for both the approximated and true states in the
   third step. Comparison between the indices demonstrates impacts of the
   erroneous measurements on security assessment.},

Abstract = {Public-key encryption schemes rely for their IND-CPA security on
   per-message fresh randomness. In practice, randomness may be of poor
   quality for a variety of reasons, leading to failure of the schemes.
   Expecting the systems to improve is unrealistic. What we show in this
   paper is that we can, instead, improve the cryptography to offset the
   lack of possible randomness. We provide public-key encryption schemes
   that achieve IND-CPA security when the randomness they use is of high
   quality, but, when the latter is not the case, rather than breaking
   completely, they achieve a weaker but still useful notion of security
   that we call IND-CDA. This hedged public-key encryption provides the
   best possible security guarantees in the face of bad randomness. We
   provide simple RO-based ways to make in-practice IND-CPA schemes hedge
   secure with minimal software changes. We also provide non-RO model
   schemes relying on lossy trapdoor functions (LTDFs) and techniques from
   deterministic encryption. They achieve adaptive security by establishing
   and exploiting the anonymity of LTDFs which we believe is of independent
   interest.},

   network named back propagation neural network (BP network) to construct
   the system. The system can automatically and rapidly adapt the change
   when there is a new intrusion appearing in the network. The result of

Abstract = {The US electric grid is facing operational, stability, and security
   challenges. Transmission system operators need some measure of
   visibility into distribution system renewable generation. Distribution
   system generation needs to support transmission system voltage. The grid
   is experiencing an expansion in measurement systems. How to take full
   advantage of this expansion and defend against attacks, both cyber and
   physical, poses additional challenges. This paper introduces software
   designed to meet these challenges. At the center of the software is an
   Integrated System Model (ISM) that spans from transmission to secondary
   distribution. The ISM is employed in real-time abnormality detection,
   voltage stability forecasting, and multi-mode control. The software
   architecture along with selected analysis modules is presented. Testing
   results are presented for: 1-attacks on utility infrastructure; 2-energy
   savings from optimal control; 3-distribution system control response
   during a low voltage transmission system event; 4-cyber-attacks on PV
   inverters, where physical inverters are used in
   hardware-in-the-simulation-loop studies. Contributions of this work
   include real-time analysis that spans from three-phase transmission
   through secondary distribution; an approach for detecting abnormalities
   that employs measurements from three independent measurement systems;
   and a multi-mode distribution system control that responds to
   cyber-attacks, physical attacks, equipment failures, and transmission
   system needs.},

Abstract = {Recent work in the area of network security, such as IPsec, provides
   mechanisms for securing the traffic between any two interconnected
   hosts. However, it is not always possible, economical, or even practical
   from an administration and operational point of view to upgrade the
   software and configuration of all the nodes in a network to support such
   security protocols.
   One apparent solution to this problem is the use of security gateways
   that apply the relevant security protocols on behalf of the protected
   nodes, under the assumption that the ``last hop{''} between the security
   gateway and the end node is safe without cryptography. Such a gateway
   can be set to enforce specific security policies for different types of
   traffic. While this solution is appealing in static scenarios (such as
   building so-called ``intranets{''}), the use of Layer-3 (network)
   routers as security gateways presents some transparency and
   configuration problems with regards to peer authentication in the
   automated key management protocol.
   This paper describes the architecture and implementation of a Layer-2
   (link layer) bridge with extensions for offering Layer-3 security
   services. We extend the OpenBSD ethernet bridge to perform simple IP
   packet filtering and IPsec processing for incoming and outgoing packets
   on behalf of a protected node, completely transparently to both the
   protected and the remote communication endpoint. The same mechanism may
   be used to construct ``virtual local area networks,{''} by establishing
   IPsec tunnels between OpenBSD bridges connected geographically separated
   LANs. As our system operates in the link layer, there is no need for
   software or configuration changes in the protected nodes.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a multi-mode generalized modified transition chaotic
   map and a switched chaotic encryption scheme based on it. Eight
   different modes of operation can be selected based on the map graph
   (concave or convex), the range modification procedure (shrinking or
   widening) and the sign of one of its independent parameters. The
   generalization and modification preserve the controllability and
   continuous chaotic behavior properties, respectively. For the same
   encryption key and map equation, multi-mode operation occurs through
   switching between four alternatives of the dependent parameters.
   Switching between various modes is shown to overpass single modes in
   randomness by investigating the frequency distribution, autocorrelation
   function, histograms and 0-1 test. In addition, most bits, 75\%, of the
   scaled and quantized chaotic output are shown to be suitable for
   pseudo-random number generation based on National Institute of Standards
   \& Technology (NIST) statistical test suite. The performance of the
   proposed scheme is validated for several speech, grayscale and RGB
   images through various evaluation criteria, where good results are
   achieved. These criteria include basic perceptual and statistical
   aspects, the more advanced NIST tests, key sensitivity and robustness
   against brute force and differential attacks. The efficiency of the
   scheme is improved by up to three or six times faster than encrypting
   one sample or one channel of a pixel at a time for speech and image
   inputs, respectively. The proposed scheme demonstrates good security and
   efficiency with more applied evaluation criteria compared to similar
   recent works.},

Abstract = {Challenges of unprecedented proportions face the electric power industry
   who takes on the responsibility for scheduling spinning reserve of a
   wind-integrated power system in an economical and reliable way. This
   study proposed a cross-entropy (CE) based simulation method to evaluate
   two indices of loss of load probability and expected demand not
   supplied, as well as the empirical distribution of demand not supplied.
   The triple together could be used for predictively sketching a full
   picture of spinning reserve inadequacy risk of a wind-integrated power
   system at an imminent operating time instance. The stochastic feature of
   the concerned multi-state system is modelled with a discrete-state
   continuous-time Markov process. Case studies based on the RTS-79 were
   carried out to illustrate the spinning reserve adequacy fluctuation
   given different present states of a rapid-start unit combined with or
   without considering the wind power penetration. Meanwhile, the advantage
   of the proposed CE simulation method over the exact convolution method
   and classical Monte Carlo simulation method in case of adequate spinning
   reserve is also demonstrated.},

Abstract = {Risk management can benefit from Web-based tools fostering actions for
   treating risks in an environment, while having several individuals
   collaborating to face the endeavors related to risks. During the
   intervention, the security rules in place to preserve resources from
   unauthorized access, might need to be modified on the fly, e.g.,
   increasing the privileges of risk managers or letting rescue teams view
   the exact position of the victims. Modifications should respect the
   overall security policies and avoid security conflicts. This paper
   presents a dynamic access control model for environmental risks
   involving physical resources. Data structures included in our Web
   application to represent both risk and security are given. To keep the
   dynamic security rules compliant with overall organization security
   objectives, we consider rules grouped in Access Control Domains so that
   changes do not create security conflicts during collaboration in risk
   management. Considering work environments as an example, risk and access
   control models are introduced. Security is built on the ABAC (Attribute
   Based Access Control) paradigm. A Risk Management System (RMS) is
   illustrated: it captures events, signals potential risks, and outputs
   strategies to prevent the risk. Dynamic authorization is included in the
   RMS to vary subjects' privileges on physical resources based on risk
   level, people position and so on. These concepts are implemented in a
   prototype Web application appearing as a Web Dashboard for risk
   management. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Sabotage Attack Detection for Additive Manufacturing Systems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {27218-27231},
Abstract = {This paper presents a novel multi-modal sabotage attack detection system
   for Additive Manufacturing (AM) machines. By utilizing multiple
   side-channels, we improve system state estimation significantly in
   comparison to uni-modal techniques. Besides, we analyze the value of
   each side-channel for performing attack detection in terms of mutual
   information shared with the machine control parameters. We evaluate our
   system on real-world test cases and achieve an attack detection accuracy
   of 98.15\%. AM, or 3D Printing, is seeing practical use for the rapid
   prototyping and production of industrial parts. The digitization of such
   systems not only makes AM a crucial technology in Industry 4.0 but also
   presents a broad attack surface that is vulnerable to kinetic
   cyberattacks. In the field of AM security, sabotage attacks are
   cyberattacks that introduce inconspicuous defects to a manufactured
   component at any specific process of the AM digital process chain,
   resulting in the compromise of the component's structural integrity and
   load-bearing capabilities. Defense mechanisms that detect such attacks
   using side-channel analysis have been studied. However, most current
   works focus on modeling the state of AM systems using a single
   side-channel, thus limiting their effectiveness at attack detection. In
   this paper, we demonstrate the value of a multi-modal sabotage attack
   detection system in comparison to uni-modal techniques.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a msulti-stage procedure to overcome the effects of

   the best membership model for modeling power system variables. Also,
   this paper presents multi-modes of fired fuzzy linguistic rules inside
   the security regions for different constrained power dispatch (CPD)
   controller centers. The optimal preventive control actions from power
   generation and transmission line power flows are prepared using MFLP
   technique. This preparation helps the system operator to face any
   emergency conditions without making a corrective control action, while,
   all system constraints are kept within their permissible limits. The
   results show the capability of the proposed procedure to remove
   different emergency condition effects. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {With the increase in society's dependence on IT communication systems,
   the need for dependable, trustable, robust and secure adaptive systems
   becomes ever more acute. Modern autonomic message-oriented middleware
   platforms have stringent requirements for self-healing, adapting,
   evolving, fault-tolerance, security and active vulnerability assessment,
   especially when the internal working model of a system and the
   environmental influences on the system are uncertain during run-time. In
   this paper we present an adaptive and evolving security (AES), and an
   adaptive trust management (ATM) approach to such autonomic messaging
   middleware systems, an approach that learns, anticipates, evolves and
   adapts to a changing environment at run-time in the face of changing
   threats. The methodology used in this research is partly analytical and
   partly experimental. This involves analysis of how the principles of AES
   and ATM can be applied to the environment resulting in the development
   of theoretical models which are then tested in practice by prototyping.},

Abstract = {The deployment of biometric recognition systems has seen a considerable
   increase over the last decade, in particular for fingerprint based
   systems. To tackle the security issues derived from presentation attacks
   launched on the biometric capture device, automatic presentation attack
   detection (PAD) methods have been proposed. In spite of their high
   detection rates on the LivDet databases, the vast majority of the
   methods rely on the samples provided by traditional capture devices,
   which may fail to detect more sophisticated presentation attack
   instrument (PAI) species. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
   fingerprint PAD which relies on an analysis of: i) the surface of the
   finger within the short wave infrared (SWIR) spectrum, and ii) the
   inside of the finger thanks to the laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI)
   technology. On the experimental evaluation over a database comprising
   more than 4700 samples and 35 PAI species, and including unknown attacks
   to model a realistic scenario, a Detection Equal Error Rate (D-EER) of
   0.5\% has been achieved. Moreover, for a BPCER <= 0.1\% (i.e., highly
   convenient system), the APCER remains around 3\%.},

Title = {Security analysis of temporal RBAC under an administrative model},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {46},
Pages = {154-172},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Security analysis of access control models is critical to confirm
   whether they ensure certain security properties. Administrative models
   specify the rules for state transition for any given access control
   model. While security analysis of role-based access control (RBAC)
   systems has been done using administrative models, work on security
   analysis of its temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal extensions has so
   far not considered the presence of any corresponding administrative
   model. In this paper, we present a methodology for performing security
   analysis of temporal RBAC (TRBAC) where state changes occur using the
   relations defined in a recently proposed administrative model named as
   AMTRAC (Administrative Model for Temporal Role-based Access Control). We
   initially define a number of security properties for TRBAC. These
   properties along with a representation of the TRBAC system and the
   administrative relations in AMTRAC are then formally specified using
   Alloy, a first order logic based language. Subsequently, validity of the
   specified properties is analyzed using the Alloy analyzer. We study the
   impact of the number of roles, users and temporal elements of TRBAC as
   well as various relations defined in AMTRAC on the time taken for
   security analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {MAS-based solution to energy management strategy of distributed

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the energy management issue of a Distributed
   Generation System (DGS) for ensuring energy supply with high security.
   Firstly, considering that the DGS is composed of many types of
   Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and a group of loads, a Multi-Agents
   System (MAS) based two hierarchical decentralized coordinated control
   scheme is constructed to deal with the complex energy management problem
   of the DGS, and JADE platform is applied to implement the MAS based
   energy management strategies. Then, the mode switching behaviors of each
   DER or load unit are described based on Petri Net (PN) models. And a
   Voltage Security Assessment (VSA) L-index is constructed. According to
   the L-index, four different operating modes of the DGS are determined
   and the coordinated control commands in the upper level agent are
   drafted. Based on PN models, according to the coordinated control
   commands, the switching control strategies are designed in the lower
   level respective unit agent to ensure secure energy supply against
   variable operating conditions. Moreover, the decentralized continuous
   controller in the lower level unit agent is also presented to
   dynamically regulate the output performance. Finally, the validity of
   proposed control scheme is demonstrated by means of simulation results.

Abstract = {Enterprises are more and more involved in collaborative business. This
   leads to open and outsourcing all or part of their information system
   (IS) to create collaborative processes by composing business services
   picked in each partner IS and to take advantage of Cloud computing.
   Business services outsourcing and their dynamic collaboration context
   can bring lost of control on IS and new security risks can occur. This
   leads to inconsistent protection allowing competitors to access to
   unauthorized information. To address this issue, systematic security
   service invocations may be added, without paying attention to the
   business context leading to costly over protection. To address this
   issue, an adaptive security service model deployment is required to
   provide a business service consistent protection by taking into account
   the collaboration context (business service data criticity, partners
   involved in the collaboration, etc.), and the cloud deployment and
   execution environment. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security
   model based on MDS@run.time, the marriage of Model Driven Security (MDS)
   and Models@run.time approaches, allowing to select at runtime the
   appropriate security components to apply. The MDS approach is used to
   generate security policies, which are interpreted at runtime and load
   appropriate security mechanisms depending on the context (which takes
   advantage of the Models@run.time approach) ensuring business process end
   to end protection. A proof of concept prototype is built on top of the
   OW2 FraSCAti middleware, validating our proposition efficiency. Our
   experiments and simulations show that MDS@run.time improves the system
   efficiency when the over-protection risk rate increases.},

Abstract = {Network security requirements based on virtual network technologies in
   IaaS platforms and corresponding solutions were reviewed. A dynamic
   network security architecture was proposed, which was built on the
   technologies of software defined networking, Virtual Machine (VM)
   traffic redirection, network policy unified management, software defined
   isolation networks, vulnerability scanning, and software updates. The
   proposed architecture was able to obtain the capacity for detection and
   access control for VM traffic by redirecting it to configurable security
   appliances, and ensured the effectiveness of network policies in the
   total life cycle of the VM by configuring the policies to the right
   place at the appropriate time, according to the impacts of VM state
   transitions. The virtual isolation domains for tenants' VMs could be
   built flexibly based on VLAN policies or Netfilter/Iptables firewall
   appliances, and vulnerability scanning as a service and software update
   as a service were both provided as security supports. Through
   cooperation with IDS appliances and automatic alarm mechanisms, the
   proposed architecture could dynamically mitigate a wide range of
   network-based attacks. The experimental results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed architecture.},

Abstract = {In actual teleoperation system, due to the components, structure,
   security and the laws of physics limit, system input, state and output
   values can not be arbitrary. These restrictions on signals if without a
   second thought in design process will likely result in system
   performance losses and even system failure or collapse. With above
   considerations, the synchronization control design problem will be
   investigated for bilateral teleoperation system under input saturation
   and multiple states constraints. To deal with the input saturation
   problem, an auxiliary system is designed. Then, adaptive controllers are
   designed by applying the backstepping method for the master and the
   slave, respectively. By constructing Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF),
   the stability and synchronization performances are guaranteed with the
   new controllers under input and multi-state constraints in the presence
   of system uncertainties and external disturbances. Finally, an
   experiment is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   method.},

Abstract = {The utilization of voltage-source converter-based multi-terminal HVDC
   (VSC-MTDC) technology has been envisaged as a cost-effective solution to
   transmit bulk renewables from multiple sending ends to receiving-end AC
   systems. However, with complex configurations and various types of
   components, the reliability evaluation of a VSC-MTDC system is more
   complicated than that of a conventional HVDC system. In addition, due to
   stochastic failures and complex operating modes, the application of a
   VSC-MTDC system can have a significant influence on the reliability of
   hybrid AC/DC power systems. This paper presents a new technique for
   evaluating the nodal reliability of a hybrid AC/DC power system based on
   the VSC-MTDC system. The proposed technique is incorporated within a
   multi-state model for the VSC-MTDC system. Then, an optimization model
   for contingency management of a hybrid AC/DC power system is formulated.
   The model is established based on the optimal power flow technique for a
   VSC-MTDC based hybrid AC/DC power system. The objective of the model is
   to minimize the total system cost when determining the load curtailment
   and generation re-dispatch results for each contingency state. Nodal
   reliability indices for hybrid AC/DC power systems are proposed to
   evaluate the reliability performance of customers at each node. The
   effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated using a modified IEEE
   reliability test system.},

Abstract = {The security of well established secure channel technologies like
   transport layer security (TLS) or IP security (IPSec) can be
   significantly improved by emerging concepts like Trusted Computing. The
   use of trusted platform modules (TPMs) offers new methods for improving
   the security of these well established technologies. How secure channel
   technologies can be adapted to use trusted computing concepts is subject
   to current research. A major part of this research addresses the
   integration of the TCGs specified remote attestation. Remote attestation
   enables a platform to provide a trustworthy proof of its current
   configuration (i.e. software that has been loaded on the platform).
   Hence, based on this proof a remote platform can decide whether to open
   a channel to another platform or not. In current approaches, the proof
   of the platform configuration is processed before a secure channel is
   established, which is not opened if the reported configuration is not
   accepted by the hosts. However, one important problem has not been
   solved yet. Currently, no satisfying solution how the change of a
   platform's configuration can be securely and reliably reported to the
   remote platform whilst a channel is open, exists. A reliable method to
   provide a proof for a configuration change can be implemented with only
   minor modifications of the TPM specification and the TLS protocol.
   Experimental results show that it is possible to implement this proof
   mechanism with only a few additional TPM commands.},

Abstract = {Edge computing supports the deployment of ubiquitous, smart services by
   providing computing and storage closer to terminal devices. However,
   ensuring the full security and privacy of computations performed at the
   edge is challenging due to resource limitation. This paper responds to
   this challenge and proposes an adaptive approach to defense
   randomization among the edge data centers via a stochastic game, whose
   solution corresponds to the optimal security deployment at the network's
   edge. Moreover, security risk is evaluated subjectively based on
   Prospect Theory to reflect realistic scenarios where the attacker and
   the edge system do not similarly perceive the status of the
   infrastructure. The results show that a non-deterministic defense policy
   yields better security compared to a static defense strategy.},

Abstract = {Access control is an essential feature of industrial software systems
   security mechanisms. Role-based access control (RBAC), which is likely
   the most popular access-control technique, specifies ``user roles{''}
   and associates each role with ``permissions{''} to access distinct
   system functionalities. These role-permissions assignment rules, as well
   as the types of system users and system functionalities, evolve over
   time. In this paper, we describe a methodology for analyzing and
   understanding the RBAC-configuration evolution, its relation to the
   overall evolutionary lifecycle of industrial systems, and its impact on
   security vulnerabilities from which the system may suffer. Our
   methodology considers two different sources of information regarding the
   RBAC-configuration evolution: 1) the role-permissions matrices of
   subsequent system versions; and 2) the corresponding concept lattices,
   implied by these matrices. By examining the evolution of these two
   system properties, developers can easily notice which versions
   involve-more and more complex RBAC-configuration changes that may
   indicate higher security risks. We demonstrate our methodology using a
   study of four popular real-world systems: 1) MediaWiki; 2) Moodle; 3)
   Joomla; and 4) WordPress. Our findings show that the proposed metrics
   have strong, positive linear correlations with the security
   vulnerabilities' properties.},

Abstract = {Introducing security features in a system is not free and brings along
   its costs and impacts. Considering this fact is essential in the design
   of real-time embedded systems which have limited resources. To ensure
   correct design of these systems, it is important to also take into
   account impacts of security features on other non-functional
   requirements, such as performance and energy consumption. Therefore, it
   is necessary to perform trade-off analysis among non-functional
   requirements to establish balance among them. In this paper, we target
   the timing requirements of real-time embedded systems, and introduce an
   approach for choosing appropriate encryption algorithms at runtime, to
   achieve satisfaction of timing requirements in an adaptive way, by
   monitoring and keeping a log of their behaviors. The approach enables
   the system to adopt a less or more time consuming (but presumably
   stronger) encryption algorithm, based on the feedback on previous
   executions of encryption processes. This is particularly important for
   systems with high degree of complexity which are hard to analyze
   statistically.},

Abstract = {This paper presents computationally efficient artificial neural network
   technique for assessing the security of the power system against line
   outages. Performance index (PI), which accounts for various line limit
   violations per contingency, is defined. The basic purpose of ANN is to
   assess the severity of line outages in terms of PI, based on training
   examples from off-line analysis. The selection of input signals for ANN
   is influenced by the operating state of the system and the contingency
   in question which determines the extent of line power limit violations.
   In an attempt to attain perfection in PI prediction, suitable
   architecture and topology for the network is investigated. To expedite
   learning process, saturating linear coupled neuron model (sl-CONE) is
   also tried out. The effectiveness of proposed technique is demonstrated
   on 5-bus (7-line) and IEEE 14-bus (21-line) test systems. Computation
   efficiency of the method makes it potential candidate for inclusion in
   online comprehensive security analysis package. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {Modern power grid is the most complex human-made system, which is
   monitored by wide-area monitoring system (WAMS). Providing
   time-synchronized data of power system operating states, WAMS will play
   a crucial role in next generation smart grid protection and control.
   WAMS helps secure efficient energy transmission as well as reliable and
   optimal grid management. As the key enabler of a smart grid, numerous
   sensors such as PMU and current sensors transmit real-time dynamic data,
   which is usually protected by encryption algorithm from malicious
   attacks, over wide-area-network (WAN) to power system control centers so
   that monitoring and control of the whole system is possible. Security
   algorithms for power grid need to consider both performance and energy
   efficiency through code optimization techniques on encryption and
   decryption. In this paper, we take power nodes (sites) as platforms to
   experimentally study ways of energy consumptions in different security
   algorithms. First, we measure energy consumptions of various security
   algorithms on CrossBow and Ember sensor nodes. Second, we propose an
   array of novel code optimization methods to increase energy consumption
   efficiency of different security algorithms. Finally, based on careful
   analysis of measurement results, we propose a set of principles on using
   security algorithms in WAMS nodes, such as cryptography selections,
   parameter configuration, and the like. Such principles can be used
   widely in other computing systems with energy constraints.},

Abstract = {Multi-cipher and multi-mode reconfigurable cryptosystems are widely used
   for hardware acceleration in modern security protocols, such as SSL and
   IPsec, but there has been hardly any work which can process multiple
   cipher algorithms with varied block lengths, key lengths and operation
   modes at a session of communication owing to the lack of suitable
   scheduling algorithms for the crypto-coprocessors and reverse schemes
   for the ciphertext. This paper proposes a NOP-cycle-padding algorithm
   (NCPA) which enables crypto-coprocessors reconfigured with diverse
   encrypting bursts to be pipeline scheduled. With NCPA, the output
   ciphertext is reversible and can be orderly sent out without any added
   cost in hardware or software. Moreover, the throughput can be upgraded
   to the maximum with an optimized number of crypto-coprocessors derived
   from NCPA.},

Abstract = {In all biometrics, face features are widely used because of their
   advantages. Compared with other biological features, the recognition
   accuracy based on face features is not very high, and the system is easy
   to be deceived by photos. Identity authentication based on multi-modal
   biometric fusion has opened up a new field of development, which has
   higher technical requirements and better application performance than
   single biometric recognition and authentication system. As a dynamic
   feature, lip reading feature is not easy to imitate, and can be
   collected with face information at the same time, so it has high
   convenience. Fusion of lip reading and face information can improve the
   accuracy of the authentication system, at the same time, greatly enhance
   the anticounterfeiting ability of the recognition system. In this paper,
   Linear Preserving Projection (LPP) is used to extract face features, and
   Projection Local Spatiotemporal Descriptor (PLSD) is used to extract lip
   reading features. In Android smart phone platform, face and lip reading
   are fused by Extreme Learning Machine, which improves the applicability
   of multi-biometric identity authentication system. The multi-mode

Abstract = {Due to an increased penetration of distributed energy resources, as well
   as more uncertain operating environment, etc., present distribution
   power system is facing many challenges. For improving the performance
   regarding dynamic stability, self-healing, security, as well as
   economical and environmental benefit, this paper proposes a hierarchical
   management and control strategy for the high-penetrated distribution
   grid based on multi-agent systems structure via intelligent switching of
   operating mode. Corresponding to the complex hybrid behaviors, the
   hierarchical control scheme is designed as a three-level decentralized
   coordinated hybrid control. The simulation studies certify that the
   hierarchical hybrid control is effective and feasible to deal with
   comprehensive problems of high-penetrated distribution grids. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Biometric security depends on its accuracy and efficiency, but is
   especially vulnerable to spoof attacks. Currently liveness detection has
   become the standard method of reducing the impact of spoof attacks,
   however whilst this protects against spoof creation and presentation, it
   does nothing to detect legitimate users being coerced into accessing
   systems. This paper looks at this coercion concept, indicating the
   impact coercion could have on biometric security and how it can be
   detected. This paper will identify scenarios in which coercion detection
   could improve security as well as identifying the underlying concepts
   that make this area up, culminating in the presentation of four high
   level techniques which can be implemented within a multi-modal biometric
   system to detect coercion detection.},

Abstract = {The safety of the Industrial Internet Control Systems has been a hotspot
   in the information security. To meet the needs of communication, a large
   variety of proprietary protocols have emerged in the field of industrial
   control. The protocol field is often trusted in the implementation of
   industrial control terminal code. If attackers modify the data of these
   fields using the protocol defect, the operation of the program can be
   controlled and the entire system will be affected. To cope with such
   security threats, academia and industry generally adopt fuzz test
   methods. However, the current industrial control protocol fuzz test
   methods generally have low code coverage, where unified description
   models are missing and test cases are not targeted. A method of
   fuzzification processing combined with dynamic multi-modal sensor
   communication data is proposed. To track the program execution, the
   dynamic pollution analysis is used to search for the input fields that
   affect the execution of the conditional branch and capture the
   dependencies between the conditional branches to guide the grammar
   generation of test cases, which can increase the chances of executing
   deep code. The experimental results show that the proposed method
   improves the validity and code coverage of test cases to a certain
   extent and greatly increases the probability of anomaly detection in the
   protocol implementation.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a novel multi-modal biometric based encryption scheme for
   medical images is proposed. It is based upon the ever-secure Advanced
   Encryption Standard Cipher Block Chaining (AES-CBC) mode of encryption
   and Indexing-First One (IFO) hashing for the generation of the secret
   keys. The proposed system utilizes two biometrics of the user, the iris
   and the fingerprint, but instead of using the features of the biometrics
   directly, they are hashed through the IFO process to create a secret key
   that can be revoked and regenerated in case of a compromise ensuring the
   security of the users biometrics. The IFO hashes obtained from the
   biometric feature vectors are then used as two different secret keys in
   a two round AES-CBC system to encrypt the medical image. The medical
   image can be decrypted by performing the AES-CBC rounds in reverse with
   the correct keys, meaning that with high probability, only the correct
   user will be able to decrypt the image. This encryption technique
   improves upon many existing medical encryption schemes based on
   biometrics, which do not take the protection of the biometric template
   into account. We were able to perform one full key generation,
   encryption and decryption in .027 seconds. In addition, this processes
   is lossless, meaning that there is no change in the pixels of the
   medical image during the encryption or decryption process, which is
   necessary of a medical image encryption system.},

Abstract = {There has been a high penetration level of Distributed Generations (DGs)
   in distribution systems in Denmark. Even more DGs are expected to be
   installed in the coming years. With that, to utilize them in maintaining
   the security of power supply is of great concern for Danish utilities.
   During the emergency in the power system, some distribution networks may
   be intentionally separated from the main grid to avoid complete system
   collapse. If DGs in those networks could continuously run instead of
   immediately being shut down, the blackout could be avoided and the
   reliability of supply could be increased. However, when to island or how
   to ensure the islanded systems can survive the islanding transition is
   uncertain. This article proposes an Islanding Security Region (ISR)
   concept to provide security assessment of island operation. By comparing
   the system operating state with the ISR, the system operator can clearly
   know if it is suitable to conduct island operation at one specific
   moment. Besides, in order to improve the computation efficiency, the
   Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is applied for fast ISR formation. Thus,
   online application of ISR based islanding security assessment could be
   realized. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Most self-service payment terminals require network connectivity for
   processing electronic payments. The necessity to maintain network
   connectivity increases costs, introduces cybersecurity risks, and
   significantly limits the number of places where the terminals can be
   installed. Leading payment service providers have proposed offline
   payment solutions that rely on algorithmically generated payment tokens.
   Existing payment token solutions, however, require complex mechanisms
   for authentication, transaction management, and most importantly,
   security risk management. In this paper, we present VOLGAPAY, a
   blockchain-based system that allows merchants to deploy secure offline
   payment terminal infrastructure that does not require collection and
   storage of any sensitive data. We design a novel payment protocol which
   mitigates security threats for all the participants of VOLGAPAY, such
   that the maximum loss from gaining full access to any component by an
   adversary incurs only a limited scope of harm. We achieve significant
   enhancements in security, operation efficiency, and cost reduction via a
   combination of polynomial multi-hash chain micropayment channels and
   blockchain grafting for off-chain channel state transition. We implement
   the VOLGAPAY payment system, and with thorough evaluation and security
   analysis, we demonstrate that VOLGAPAY is capable of delivering a fast,
   secure, and cost-efficient solution for offline payment terminals.},

   and software maintenance to identify the internal routes of execution
   and state changes while the software operates. Its quality has a high
   influence on the duration of the analysis required to locate software
   faults. Nevertheless, execution tracing quality has not been described
   by a quality model, which is an impediment while measuring software
   product quality. In addition, such a model needs to consider
   uncertainty, as the underlying factors involve human analysis and
   assessment. The goal of this study is to address both issues and to fill
   the gap by defining a quality model for execution tracing. The data
   collection was conducted on a defined study population with the
   inclusion of software professionals to consider their accumulated
   experiences; moreover, the data were processed by genetic algorithms to
   identify the linguistic rules of a fuzzy inference system. The
   linguistic rules constitute a human-interpretable rule set that offers
   further insights into the problem domain. The study found that the
   quality properties accuracy, design and implementation have the
   strongest impact on the quality of execution tracing, while the property
   legibility is necessary but not completely inevitable. Furthermore, the
   quality property security shows adverse effects on the quality of
   execution tracing, but its presence is required to some extent to avoid
   leaking information and to satisfy legal expectations. The created model
   is able to describe execution tracing quality appropriately. In future
   work, the researchers plan to link the constructed quality model to
   overall software product quality frameworks to consider execution
   tracing quality with regard to software product quality as a whole. In
   addition, the simplification of the mathematically complex model is also
   planned to ensure an easy-to-tailor approach to specific application
   domains.},

Abstract = {The rapid growth in the demand for Future Internet services with many
   emerging group applications has driven the development of satellite,
   which is the preferred delivery mechanism due to its wide area coverage,
   multicasting capability and speed to deliver affordable future services.
   Nevertheless, security has been one of the obstacles for both satellite
   services as well as smart grid group applications, especially with
   logical/geographical/cryptographic domains spanning heterogeneous
   networks and regions. In this paper, adaptive security architecture is
   implemented to protect satellite services for smart grid group
   applications. The focus is on key management and policy provisioning.
   Leveraging Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) as the standard for
   smart grid centralized key/policy management architecture, a single
   Domain of Interpretation (DOI) is deployed and evaluated critically in
   terms of the added protocol signaling overhead on the satellite system
   for a fixed-network scenario. This also partially realizes the growing
   trend towards the use of TCP/IP technology for smart grid applications.},

Abstract = {Many aspects of cryptographic security proofs can be seen as the proof
   that a certain system (e.g. a block cipher) is indistinguishable from an
   ideal system (e.g. a random permutation), for different types of
   distinguishers.
   This paper presents a new generic approach to proving upper bounds on
   the information-theoretic distinguishing advantage (from an ideal
   system) for a combined system, assuming upper bounds of certain types
   for the component systems. For a general type of combination operation
   of systems, including the XOR of functions or the cascade of
   permutations, we prove two amplification theorems. The first is a,
   product theorem, in the spirit of XOR-lemmas: The distinguishing
   advantage of the combination of two systems is at most twice the product
   of the individual distinguishing advantages. This bound is optimal. The
   second theorem states that the combination of systems is secure against
   some strong class of distinguishers, assuming only that the components
   are secure against some weaker class of distinguishers.
   A key technical tool of the paper is the proof of a tight two-way
   correspondence, previously only known to hold in one direction, between
   the distinguishing advantage of two systems and the probability of
   winning an appropriately defined game.},

Abstract = {A popular countermeasure against IP piracy is to obfuscate the Finite
   State Machine (FSM) which is assumed to be the heart of a digital
   system. Most of the existing FSM obfuscation strategies rely on
   additionally introduced set of obfuscation mode state-transitions to
   protect the original state-transitions of the FSM. Although these
   methods assume that it is difficult to extract the FSM behavior from the
   flattened gate-level netlist, some recent reverse engineering attacks
   could successfully break the defense of these schemes. The capability of
   differentiating obfuscation mode state-transitions from normal mode
   state-transitions makes these attacks powerful. As a countermeasure
   against these attacks, we propose a new strategy that offers a key-based
   obfuscation to each state-transition of the FSM. We use a special class
   of non-group additive cellular automata (CA), called D1 {*} CA, and it's
   counterpart D1{*}CA(dual) to obfuscate each state-transition of the FSM.
   Each state-transition has its own customized key, which must be
   configured correctly in order to get correct state-transition behavior
   from the synthesized FSM. A second layer of protection to the
   state-transition logic enhances the security of the proposed scheme. An
   in-depth security analysis of the proposed easily testable
   key-controlled FSM synthesis scheme demonstrates its ability to thwart
   the majority of the state-of-the-art attacks, such as FSM reverse
   engineering, SAT, and circuit unrolling attacks. Thus, the proposed
   scheme can be used for IP protection of the digital designs.
   Experimentations on various IWLS'93 benchmark FSM designs show that the
   average area, power, and delay overheads our proposed multi-bit
   key-based obfuscated FSM design are 56.43\%, 6.87\%, and 23.41\% while
   considering the FSMs as standalone circuits. However, experimentation on
   the Amber23 processor core shows these overheads drastically reduce
   (reported area, power, and delay overheads values are 0.0025\%, 0.44\%,
   and 0\%, respectively) while compared with respect to the entire design.},

Title = {Dynamic Security Domain Scaling on Embedded Symmetric Multiprocessors},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {We propose a method for dynamic security-domain scaling on SMPs that
   offers both highly scalable performance and high security for future
   high-end embedded systems. Its most important feature is its highly
   efficient use of processor resources, accomplished by dynamically
   changing the number of processors within a security-domain (i.e.,
   dynamically yielding processors to other security-domains) in response
   to application load requirements. Two new technologies make this scaling
   possible without any virtualization software: (1) self-transition
   management and (2) unified virtual address mapping. Evaluations show
   that this domain control provides highly scalable performance and incurs
   almost no performance overhead in security-domains. The increase in OSs
   in binary code size is less than 1.5\%, and the time required for
   individual state transitions is on the order of a single millisecond.
   This scaling is the first in the world to make possible the dynamic
   changing of the number of processors within a security-domain on an ARM
   SMP.},

Abstract = {Due to its extreme vulnerability satisfactory security provisioning in
   Wireless Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks (WAHSN) is crucial; however, often a
   highly secure mechanism inevitably consumes a rather large amount of
   system resources, which in turn many unintentionally cause a security
   servce Denial of Service (SSDoS) attack. The scheme proposed in this
   paper sets out a framework which is capable of deploying different
   combinations of security services to satisfy different security, need at
   different time for different applications. Consequently, a suitable
   security service is provisioned in an adaptive way to achieve the
   maximum overall security-services against nework-performance-services
   throughout the course of WAHSN operation. Furthermore, additional
   security capability can be achieved via the self-adaptive security
   services hopping.},

Abstract = {User authentication is fundamental to the protection of information
   systems. It is the first and most critical link in the security chain
   that restricts access to system and data resources to legitimate users
   only. The advantages of using biometrics to verify a person's identity
   over using passwords or tokens have been broadly presented. However,
   recent research has revealed that biometric technologies can be defeated
   with low-tech and cheap materials. This presents a new challenge at a
   time when people are encouraged to use biometrics as a means to enhance
   network security. Since biometrics are not secrets, there exists a risk
   of them being captured, copied, and forged. In this paper, the biometric
   authentication's vulnerability to various attacks is analyzed, and
   efforts to defeat the spoofing attacks are presented. In particular,
   multi-modal biometric fusion approaches are presented to counteract
   security threats.},

Abstract = {An effort to deploy security devices by the network provider has been
   increasing as the network is being exposed to various types of network
   attacks. However, network providers are incapable of handling all types
   of attacks as each security device is designed for a certain purpose. If
   an attack breaks out, only one particular device becomes busy in terms
   of resource usage while others being idle. Moreover, it is hard to
   adjust a level of security service with respect to the importance of
   network flow. To address these issues, we propose a new security
   solution, QoSE, which provides adaptive security services based on
   Network Function Virtualization (NFV). QoSE provides a capability to
   manage resource usage that the network flow is not concentrated on a
   specific node. We design QoSE considering a distributed NFV environment
   to avoid a single point of failure and a bottleneck problem. Our
   proposed solution has also shown a quick recovery from fault situation.
   In addition, we provide a novel resource optimization algorithm to
   operate security services efficiently. We have implemented a prototype
   system to verify our ideas and have checked that QoSE shows reasonable
   performance compared with a common device.},

   In IBR, a ciphertext is associated with a set of revoked users instead
   of a set of receivers and the maximum number of users in the system can
   be an exponential value in the security parameter. In this paper, we
   reconsider the general method of Lee et al. (ESORICS 2014) that
   constructs a public-key revocation (PKR) scheme by combining the subset
   difference (SD) method of Naor, Naor, and Lotspiech (CRYPTO 2001) and a
   single revocation encryption (SRE) scheme. Lee et al. left it as an open
   problem to construct an SRE scheme under the standard assumption without
   random oracles. In this paper, we first propose a selectively secure SRE
   scheme under the standard assumption without random oracles. We also
   propose a fully secure SRE scheme under simple static assumptions
   without random oracles. Next, we present an efficient IBR scheme that
   supports fast decryption by combining the SD method and our SRE scheme.
   The security of our IBR scheme depends on that of the underlying SRE
   scheme. Finally, we implemented our SRE and IBR schemes and measured the
   performance.},

Pages = {9442-9453},
Abstract = {We investigate the secrecy rate optimization problem in a wiretap
   channel with a single-antenna source, a single-antenna eavesdropper, and
   a multiple-antenna full-duplex (FD) destination. To fully utilize the
   spatial degrees-of-freedom of multiple antennas, the function of
   antennas at the destination is not predefined, i.e., each antenna can
   operate in a transmit or receive mode. We propose a low-complexity
   near-optimal joint optimization scheme by jointly applying the dynamic
   antenna mode switching (AMS) and optimal power allocation (OPA)
   techniques, to maximize the secrecy rate of the FD destination-based
   jamming (DBJ) system. The proposed joint optimization scheme is valid
   for two different eavesdropping channel state information (ECSI)
   availability cases, i.e., instantaneous ECSIs and statistical ECSIs.
   Specifically, closed-form expressions of OPA factors are first derived,
   and then the optimal transmit and receive antennas sets at the
   destination are determined by combining the OPA factor and applying a
   greedy-search-based AMS approach for both ECSIs availabilities,
   respectively. Moreover, through complexity analysis, the search
   complexity of the proposed scheme is proven to be significantly reduced
   compared with the exhaustive searching method. Simulation results verify
   the secrecy performance superiority of the proposed scheme over the
   conventional FD-DBJ method.},

Abstract = {Recent studies have shown that information misuse is more abundant
   within organizations, possibly from the modern proliferation of phishing
   and social engineering attacks, To address this problem, security
   experts have proposed local, internal inspection, known as Host-Based
   Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS). This technique allows detection of
   malicious activity to occur at the endpoints the individual host. This
   research proposes AHNSR: Active Host-based Network Security Response,
   which utilizes HIDS with Software Defined Networking (SDN) in order to
   enhance system security, allowing dynamic active response and
   reconstruction from a global network topology perspective. Vital to the
   operational architecture, SDN introduces new programming capabilities
   that resolve the rigid configurations of traditional networks. This is
   essential in an era of rapidly evolving threats that require unique and
   adaptive security defenses in both virtualized and enterprise
   environments. SDN-software security controls aim at providing access to
   legitimate users, protecting systems from attacks, and providing
   mitigation or countermeasures when attacks do occur. AHNSR is a complete
   and automated dynamic security solution, starting with alert generation
   and ending with an appropriate SON enabled response on physical switch
   flow tables. Responses can include traffic redirection, host
   quarantining, filtering, and more. SON allows greater flexibility and
   command/control compared to legacy, manual administrator response or the
   iptables solution of traditional IDS. By pushing security event
   information to a global controller, immediate and intelligent changes
   can be made across the network. When an attack occurs, AHNSR increases
   responsiveness while decreasing information damage- a goal every
   incident response team should have. We compare different methods of
   pushing security event information from hosts and the resulting system
   performance at specified security level thresholds. A testable
   SON-controlled network is constructed with multiple hosts, OpenFlow
   enabled switches, and a Floodlight controller, all linked to a custom,
   novel interface for the Open-Source SECurity (OSSEC) HIDS framework,
   OSSEC is implemented in a server-agent architecture, allowing scale
   bility and OS independence. System effectiveness is evaluated against
   the following factors: alert density, file integrity check frequency,
   rootkit detection status, and log monitoring workload, At the expected
   operational load of 500 events per second (EPS), results reveal a mean
   system response time of.5564 seconds from log generation to flow table
   update via Floodlight's Access Control List module, Load testing further
   assesses performance of response methods at EPS levels 10- 10000.},

Abstract = {Securing any information exchanged within a Body Area Network (BAN) from
   unauthorized tampering is essential to ensure that such systems are
   safe, and thus do no harm, to the people using them. Solutions for
   enabling information security in BANs require extensive use of
   cryptographic primitives that involve considerable performance overhead.
   Consequently, information security is typically not available in
   wearable technologies. We need adaptive security solutions that increase
   the level of security in the event of threats but otherwise impose
   minimal security overhead in order for them to viable for BANs. The
   first step in building adaptive security for BANs is to detect the
   threats. In this paper we propose a solution for detecting adversaries
   attacking the communication channel of a BAN called a wearable honeypot
   system. It works by communicating fake user health information between
   the base station and a set of designated decoy nodes in the BAN. Any
   alteration of this traffic, in content or arrival time, is considered
   adversarial tampering. A preliminary implementation of this wearable
   honeypot system demonstrates that it is effective in detecting a variety
   of communication attacks on a BAN.},

Abstract = {The notion of extended nested dual system groups (ENDSG) was recently
   proposed by Hofheinz et al. {[}PKC 2015] for constructing almost-tight
   identity based encryptions (IBE) in the multi-instance, multi-ciphertext
   (MIMC) setting. However only a composite-order instantiation was
   proposed and more efficient prime-order instantiations are absent. The
   paper fills the blank by presenting two constructions.
   We revise the definition of ENDSG and realize it using prime-order
   bilinear groups based on Chen and Wee's prime-order instantiation of
   nested dual system groups {[}CRYPTO 2013]. This yields the first
   almost-tight IBE in the prime-order setting achieving weak adaptive
   security in MIMC scenario under the d-linear (d-Lin) assumption. We
   further enhanced the revised ENDSG to capture stronger security notions
   for IBE, including B-weak adaptive security and full adaptive security.
   We show that our prime-order instantiation is readily B-weak adaptive
   secure and full adaptive secure without introducing extra assumption.
   We then try to find better solutions by fine-tuning ENDSG again and
   realizing it using the technique of Chen, Gay, and Wee {[}EUROCRYPT
   2015]. This leads to an almost-tight secure IBE in the same setting with
   better performance than our first result, but the security relies on a
   non-standard assumption, d-linear assumption with auxiliary input
   (d-LinAI) for an even positive integer d. However we note that, the
   2-LinAI assumption is implied by the external decisional linear (XDLIN)
   assumption. This concrete instantiation could also be realized using
   symmetric bilinear groups under standard decisional linear assumption.},

Abstract = {The potential impacts of man-made and natural disasters on chemical
   plants, complexes, and supply chains are of great importance to homeland
   security. To be able to estimate these impacts, we developed an
   agent-based chemical supply chain model that includes: chemical plants
   with enterprise operations such as purchasing, production scheduling,
   and inventories; merchant chemical markets, and multi-modal chemical
   shipments. Large-scale simulations of chemical-plant activities and
   supply chain interactions, running on desktop computers, are used to
   estimate the scope and duration of disruptive-event impacts, and overall
   system resilience, based on the extent to which individual chemical
   plants can adjust their internal operations (e.g., production mixes and
   levels) versus their external interactions (market sales and purchases,
   and transportation routes and modes). To illustrate how the model
   estimates the impacts of a hurricane disruption, a simple example model
   centered on 1,4-butanediol is presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {With the rapid development of bulk power grid under extra-high voltage
   (EHV) AC/DC hybrid power system and extensive access of distributed
   energy resources (DER), operation characteristics of power grid have
   become increasingly complicated. To cope with new severe challenges
   faced by safe operation of interconnected bulk power grids, an in-depth
   analysis of bulk power grid security defense system under the background
   of EHV and new energy resources was implemented from aspects of
   management and technology in this paper. Supported by big data and cloud
   computing, bulk power grid security defense system was divided into two
   parts: one is the prevention and control of operation risks. Power grid
   risks are eliminated and influence of random faults is reduced through
   measures such as network planning, power-cut scheme, risk pre-warning,
   equipment status monitoring, voltage control, frequency control and
   adjustment of operating mode. The other is the fault recovery control..
   By updating ``three defense lines{''}, intelligent relay protection is
   used to deal with the challenges brought by EHV AC/DC hybrid grid and
   new energy resources. And then security defense system featured by
   passive defense is promoted to active type power grid security defense
   system.},

Abstract = {Using high-level security policy rules to regulate low-level system, the
   security management system with a high level of expansibility and
   flexibility was made. For purpose of managing network security policy
   duly and flexibly in the complex network environment, and resolving its
   issue efficiency, a dynamic and self-adaptive security policy
   realization mechanism is proposed. The accident monitor and policy
   life-cycle are put forward, and the impact of safety equipment or user
   requests, such as system resources found on the flow control can be
   calculated automatically. The system can independently carry out a
   dynamic, flexible and real-time to adjust and control in the network
   environment and security needs change. The distribution model is given
   to response policy request rapidly, take the appropriate policy
   dissemination methods, and reduce PDP computing tasks, system resource
   consumption, which introduces the concepts of issue affecting factors,
   security domain addresses allocation, etc. Expression and making ways of
   the strucure-dissimilarity policy faced on attribute characters and
   operation are analyzed emphatically. The effectiveness of the proposed
   model and algorithms is proved by experiments.},

Abstract = {With the development of web-application, especially E-commerce, many
   software designers need to incorporate either low-level security
   function-alities into their programs. This involves the implementation
   of security features using Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA), Java
   Cryptography Extension (JCE) and Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) API
   provided by Sun Corporation {[}1]. Through our discovery, we find that
   many functional security related features in software systems are
   usually implemented by a few methods. The use of these methods results
   to some necessary structural patterns in reduced control flow graph of
   the program. In this papers, we present our way to recover the security
   features by recognizing these methods invocations automatically and
   transform the reduced control flow graph to state transition diagram
   through functional abstractions. We believe that it would not only
   facilitate the comprehension of the security framework implemented in
   the program, but also make the further verification of the security
   features possible.},

Abstract = {This study aims to perceive the potential security threats in unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted communication networks and to determine
   the feasible and effective security solutions in order to ensure secured
   UAV assisted cyber physical system (CPS) (UAV-a-CPS). Fifth generation
   (5G) and beyond wireless technology is capable to provide support for a
   plethora of data hungry and time sensitive applications. UAV is one of
   the vital features of SG and beyond cellular technology to be deployed
   in a wide gamut of applications. Since the application domain of UAV
   networks includes civilian, aviation, and military sectors, thus it can
   be a prime target to the hackers. This work emphasizes the security
   issues that require to be prioritized and addressed with appropriate
   security measures to make UAV-a-CPS secured and safe enough for
   commercial applications. Moreover, we provide several innovative,
   scalable, and insightful design considerations to encounter security
   threats inherent to UAV networks. It is shown that the multi-layer based
   adaptive security approaches would be beneficial to protect UAV-a-CPS
   from the potential and emerging security threats effectively. Finally,
   we provide probable futuristic research directions to add newer

   Biometric systems are broadly categories into two types: Uni-modal and
   Multi-modal. By comparing both these systems, it is clear that
   multi-modal biometric systems are gathering more popularity as it has
   the capability of dealing challenges involved in uni-modal biometric
   systems such as: non-universality, captured data noise, variations

Abstract = {Increasing the penetration of variable generation has a substantial
   effect on the operational reliability of power systems. The higher level
   of uncertainty that stems from this variability makes it more difficult
   to determine whether a given operating condition will be secure or
   insecure. Data-driven techniques provide a promising way to identify
   security rules that can be embedded in economic dispatch model to keep
   power system operating states secure. This paper proposes using a sparse
   weighted oblique decision tree to learn accurate, understandable, and
   embeddable security rules that are linear and can be extracted as sparse
   matrices using a recursive algorithm. These matrix rules can then be
   easily embedded as security constraints in power system economic
   dispatch calculations using the Big-M method. Tests on several large
   datasets with high renewable energy penetration demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the sparse weighted
   oblique decision tree outperforms the state-of-art weighted oblique
   decision tree while keeping the security rules simple. When embedded in
   the economic dispatch, these rules significantly increase the percentage
   of secure states and reduce the average solution time.},

   dynamic aspects such as redundant mechanisms, fault and error recovery
   mechanisms, and different operation modes. The conventional nodes of
   attack trees can not adequately capture the attacks towards those

   difficult. This paper introduces new nodes to model the security of
   those systems. The nodes include: PAND node, k/n node, SEQ node, CSUB
   node, and Housing node. We provide the syntax and graphical
   representation for each node. The nodes allow us to model attacks that
   require exploitation of vulnerabilities which have dependence on
   ordering events, sequence-dependant events, conditional failures and
   mechanisms which involve configuration changes with time. We use the
   nodes to construct attack trees for different security related systems.},

Abstract = {Quantum information protocol with quantum resources shows a great
   advantage in substantially improving security, fidelity, and capacity of
   information processing. Various quantum information protocols with
   diverse functionalities have been proposed and implemented. However, in
   general, the present quantum information system can only carry out a
   single information protocol or deal with a single communication task,
   which limits its practical application in the future. Therefore, it is
   essential to develop a multifunctional platform compatible with multiple
   different quantum information protocols. In this Letter, by utilizing an
   all-optical platform consisting of a gain-tunable parametric amplifier,
   a beam splitter, and an entanglement source, we experimentally realize
   the partially disembodied quantum state transfer protocol, which links
   the all-optical quantum teleportation protocol and the optimal 1 -> N
   coherent state cloning protocol. As a result, these three protocols,
   which have different physical essences and functionalities, are
   implemented in a single all-optical machine. In particular, we
   demonstrate that the partially disembodied quantum state transfer
   protocol can enhance the state transfer fidelity compared with
   all-optical quantum teleportation under the same strength of
   entanglement. Our all-optical quantum state transfer machine paves a way
   to implement the multifunctional quantum information system.},

Abstract = {Software-defined networks (SDNs) pose both an opportunity and challenge
   to the network security community. The opportunity lies in the ability
   of SDN applications to express intelligent and agile threat mitigation
   logic against hostile flows, without the need for specialized inline
   hardware. However, the SDN community lacks a secure control-layer to
   manage the interactions between the application layer and the switch
   infrastructure (the data plane). There are no available SDN controllers
   that provide the key security features, trust models, and policy
   mediation logic, necessary to deploy multiple SDN applications into a
   highly sensitive computing environment. We propose the design of
   security extensions at the control layer to provide the security
   management and arbitration of conflicting flow rules that arise when
   multiple applications are deployed within the same network. We present a
   prototype of our design as a Security Enhanced version of the widely
   used OpenFlow Floodlight Controller, which we call SE-Floodlight.
   SE-Floodlight extends Floodlight with a security-enforcement kernel
   (SEK) layer, whose functions are also directly applicable to other
   OpenFlow controllers. The SEK adds a unique set of secure application
   management features, including an authentication service, role-based
   authorization, a permission model for mediating all configuration change
   requests to the data-plane, inline flow-rule conflict resolution, and a
   security audit service. We demonstrate the robustness and scalability of
   our system implementation through both a comprehensive functionality
   assessment and a performance evaluation that illustrates its sub-linear
   scaling properties.},

   events in the classified domains can be utilized to calculate system
   operating limits and risk indices. The identified system outage events
   can provide power engineers with additional information which can be
   used to evaluating reinforcement or modifications. Studies on a

Title = {Enhancing Sensor Network Security with Improved Internal Hardware Design},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), sensors are
   being widely applied in industry and human life. Sensor networks based
   on IoT have strong Information transmission and processing capabilities.
   The security of sensor networks is progressively crucial. Cryptographic
   algorithms are widely used in sensor networks to guarantee security.
   Hardware implementations are preferred, since software implementations
   offer lower throughout and require more computational resources.
   Cryptographic chips should be tested in a manufacturing process and in
   the field to ensure their quality. As a widely used
   design-for-testability (DFT) technique, scan design can enhance the
   testability of the chips by improving the controllability and
   observability of the internal flip-flops. However, it may become a
   backdoor to leaking sensitive information related to the cipher key, and
   thus, threaten the security of a cryptographic chip. In this paper, a
   secure scan test architecture was proposed to resist scan-based
   noninvasive attacks on cryptographic chips with boundary scan design.
   Firstly, the proposed DFT architecture provides the scan chain reset
   mechanism by gating a mode-switching detection signal into reset input
   of scan cells. The contents of scan chains will be erased when the
   working mode is switched between test mode and functional mode, and
   thus, it can deter mode-switching based noninvasive attacks. Secondly,
   loading the secret key into scan chains of cryptographic chips is
   prohibited in the test mode. As a result, the test-mode-only scan attack
   can also be thwarted. On the other hand, shift operation under
   functional mode is disabled to overcome scan attack in the functional
   mode. The proposed secure scheme ensures the security of cryptographic
   chips for sensor networks with extremely low area penalty.},

Abstract = {This paper exhibits varied methods for voltage security assessment in a
   restructured power system. This paper primarily lays emphasis on two
   methods that are Probabilistic Fuzzy Decision Tree (PFDT) and Case Based
   Reasoning (CBR). In PFDT, Decision Tree plays an integral role for
   classification of system. For further classification of power system
   security, an algorithm is developed to categorise the buses which
   trouble the security most. After classification of system, by using
   minimum amount of load curtailment of voltages on buses which made
   insecure to secure load. Optimization of load is done by curtailing
   reactive power from insecure buses. In CBR, old cases from database are
   used for solving the problems of new case. Hence, PFDT is retrained in
   system during real operation for solving the new operating states which
   are found insecure in CBR approach. In case of emergency or a critical
   situation, structure of the power system networks changes but in such a
   condition CBR also gives better results by using re-training process.
   After re-training in real-time, CBR revises its database by accepting
   new conditions and stored for their further uses. These two methods are
   analysed on the standard test system i.e. IEEE-30 Bus along with desired
   accuracy. Copyright (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {In response to the multi-state simulation business process requirements
   of large power grids in actual engineering, a logic configuration
   platform of large power grid security and stability simulation is
   designed in this paper. In order to improve the application adaptability
   of the existing configuration software, firstly, the overall
   architecture and visual operation interface design of the logic
   configuration platform of large power grid security and stability
   simulation are proposed. Secondly, the key technologies to realize the
   generalized logic configuration platform of large power grid simulation
   are deeply discussed from the aspects of logic compilation and engine
   implementation. Thirdly, based on the configuration platform, the
   innovative application of intelligent large power grid operation mode
   arrangement system is realized. Practice shows that after the
   introduction of logic configuration, the time consumption is reduced by
   more than 85\% compared with the traditional manual flow coding method
   and by more than 90\% compared with the traditional manual batch power
   flow calculation and modulation process, which effectively improves the
   work efficiency and greatly saves the working time. In the system
   development, the visual logic configuration mode replaces the
   engineering customization mode of conventional manual software coding,
   which greatly improves the engineering adaptability of multi-state large
   power grid simulation business requirements. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Abstract = {Measurement and control system integrating different software and
   hardware is used to measure parameters, monitor process and control
   operation, which has been widely applied in critical infrastructures and
   has adopted Ethernet for data exchange. The recent publications have
   indicated that measurement and control systems are very vulnerable when
   they are exposed to cyber-attacks due to various intrinsic security
   weakness. Fins protocol as one of the most popular protocols is built
   into a larger number of Ormon devices that are used in different kinds
   of measurement, and control systems and has been targeted as the
   desirable candidate for cyber-attack. However, the traditional detection
   method based on traffic analysis and function code compliance detection
   is unable to detect mode-switching attack that is consistent with the
   protocol syntax, and it is a very harmful network attack against
   industrial devices. In this paper, we analyze the defects of measurement
   and control system using Fins protocol, launch mode-switching attack
   against Ormon PLC devices and display how to defend against this attack
   by designing a detection rules insert into Snort. Then, this detection
   approach is carried out to protect the security of Ormon PLC. Finally,
   the experimental results show that our detection approach can
   distinguish and detect this malicious cyber-attack efficiently.},

Abstract = {This paper presents case-based reasoning (CBR) technique, a novel
   approach for voltage security assessment in real time environment. The
   CBR is an artificial intelligence methodology; extract the information
   of voltage security from large sets of possible operating conditions of
   the power system, which are screened off-line by randomly varying the
   real and reactive loads at PQ buses. In real time environment, data-base
   may be created by keeping the record of operating states by state
   estimation. The severity of contingency for each case with respect to
   different contingencies (single line outages) is assessed by number of
   secure and insecure operating states, which is predicted by CBR Security
   classes are defined by threshold value of maximum loadability margins,
   calculated using the continuation power flow analysis. The effectiveness
   of the proposed approach is tested on 30-Bus IEEE test system. The
   proposed method gives fast and accurate voltage security information for
   unknown patterns and it is found to be suitable for on-line applications
   at energy management systems.},

Abstract = {Corrective transmission switching schemes are an essential part of grid
   operations and are used to improve the reliability of the grid as well
   as the operational efficiency. Today, the transmission switching schemes
   are established based on the operator's past knowledge of the system as
   well as other ad-hoc methods. In this paper, three topology control
   (corrective transmission switching) methodologies are presented along
   with the detailed formulation of robust corrective switching. By
   incorporating robust optimization into the corrective switching
   framework, the switching solution is guaranteed to be feasible for a
   range of system operating states. The robust model can be solved offline
   to suggest switching actions that can be used in a dynamic security
   assessment tool in real-time. The proposed robust topology control
   algorithm can also generate multiple corrective switching actions for a
   particular contingency. The robust topology control formulation is
   tested on an IEEE 118-bus test case with different uncertainty sets.},

Abstract = {Accurate determination of present operating state of power system takes
   utmost importance for utility operator for reliable and secure operation
   of power system. Conventional power flow methods have the limitations of
   larger memory requirement, longer computational time and infeasible
   options for real time applications for security assessment. Moreover,
   using performance index based on bus voltage deviations and line
   loadings for security assessment suffers with masking problem and fails
   to discriminate the contingency cases with the closer violations. Hence,
   composite security index has been formulated in this work addressing
   hyper-ellipse encompassed within a hyper-box concept to address
   multiclass classification problem of power system security using support
   vector machine (SVM). Sequential forward selection has been implemented
   for optimal feature selections to achieve the highest classification
   accuracy and the least mis-classification rate. The results of the
   proposed method have been validated and compared with existing method
   for three IEEE standard test systems. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by

Title = {Adaptive security management of real-time storage applications over NAND
   based storage systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS},

Volume = {52},
Pages = {139-153},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Embedded devices are much easier to be stolen or lost due to the
   characteristics of mobility and less caring, which may result in the
   information disclosure and privacy loss without any security protection
   of critical data. With the advantages of low cost and fast access speed,
   non-volatile memories (NVMs) like NAND flash memory have become a
   critical component in building security-critical real-time embedded
   devices. Therefore, to improve the security protection of NVM-based
   embedded systems becomes a great challenge. In this paper, we are
   interested in online optimization of security-sensitive storage
   applications over modern NVM-based embedded systems, whose workloads are
   unpredictable but have explicit timing constraint and certain security
   constraint. Sensitive data must be stored before a specific deadline,
   otherwise it will lose its validity. To address these challenges, this
   paper presents a Feedback Vulnerability and Utilization Control (FVUC)
   mechanism. FVUC employs two proportional-integral controllers, the
   Utilization Controller and the Vulnerability Controller, to build a big
   feedback loop which dynamically monitors the system run-time status as
   well as decides how many flash pages would be encrypted by a
   cryptography service. Relied on the accurate model and design, FVUC can
   make a balance between the utilization and vulnerability, and achieve a
   better overall performance. Based on synthetic experiments, we obtain
   that FVUC can fully beat other three mechanisms on the overall
   performance with acceptable time overhead. Equipped with
   proportional-integral controller, FVUC can make the system more stable
   than the one with only proportional controller. The proposed mechanism
   can be utilized to resist on-line confidential attack and even achieve
   the off-line privacy protection when embedded devices are lost or
   stolen. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Airspace security is a mission that is shared by the Federal Aviation
   Administration (FAA), Department of Defense (DoD), Department of
   Homeland Security (DHS), and National Airspace System (NAS) users among
   others including civil airspace users. Because events can unfold rapidly
   in the air domain, Shared Situational Awareness among the players is
   needed to facilitate rapid decision-making that can have life-or-death
   consequences. The current airspace security operation relies heavily on
   telephonic coordination with limited shared situational awareness, and
   treats potential threats in a ``one-size-fits-all{''} manner, rather
   than focusing on highest risk. The future vision is the Next Generation
   Air Transportation system (NextGen) Secure Airspace concept, which is
   part of a multi-layered, adaptive security service that is
   risk-informed, is integrated into trajectory-based operations, and
   operates in a net-enabled environment.
   This paper describes the airspace security mission, the future concept,
   mission partner perspectives for information sharing, and challenges and
   opportunities in improving shared situational awareness.},

Abstract = {In this study, the authors present an efficient public-key broadcast
   encryption (PKBE) scheme with sub-linear size of public keys, private
   keys and ciphertexts and prove its adaptive security under standard
   assumptions. Compared with the currently best scheme of Garg et al. (CCS
   2010) that provides adaptive security under standard assumptions and
   sub-linear size of various parameters, the ciphertext size of the
   author's scheme is 94\% shorter and the encryption algorithm of their
   scheme is also 2.8 times faster than the scheme of Garg et al. To
   achieve their scheme, they adapt the dual system encryption technique of
   Waters. However, there is a challenging problem to use this technique
   for the construction of PKBE with sub-linear size of ciphertexts such as
   a tag compression problem. To overcome this problem, they first devise a
   novel tag update technique for broadcast encryption. Using this
   technique, they build an efficient PKBE scheme in symmetric bilinear
   groups, and prove its adaptive security under standard assumptions.},

Abstract = {In public key broadcast encryption systems, anyone could run the
   encryption algorithm to broadcast messages by using the public
   parameters. The unsupervised broadcast strategy allows malicious users
   (even though someone outside the system with the intentionally divulged
   public parameters) to distribute junk messages without responsibility.
   Consequently, content distributor authentication is essential for
   broadcast encryption systems to forbid spreading of junk information. In
   this work, we devise a solution for public key broadcast encryption
   system with adaptive security to resolve the aforementioned vicious
   broadcaster problem, which is neglected in the previous related works.
   In our scheme, any user could distribute an encryption of messages with
   both public parameters and his/her own secret keys, and each message is
   associated to its broadcaster. The construction is based on the
   composite order bilinear groups and its adaptive security depends on the
   hardness of the general subgroup decisional assumptions. Furthermore,
   this allows our scheme to be flexible in terms on the overhead of
   ciphertexts, which is constant sized. Compared with previous related
   broadcast encryption systems constructed in the composite order bilinear
   groups, our scheme inherits the superiority of adaptive security based
   non-interactive falsifiable assumption, and simultaneously achieves the
   optimal ciphertext overhead and the authentication of broadcasters.},

Abstract = {The digital revolution and faster switching devices have introduced more
   sophisticated control systems that require high quality and reliable

   system, which has the reduced number of switching elements preserving
   the same power conversion functionality is proposed. The proposed
   multi-mode energy conversion system is able to supply energy from
   multi-sources (renewable energy source, battery, and ultra-capacitor) to
   a load and store energy with the minimum number of switching elements.
   The proposed approach is verified both by simulations and experiments.
   The results will enable more timely and wide usage of

Abstract = {Based on Markov chain analysis method, the situation prediction of smart
   grid security and stability can he judged in this paper. First component
   state transition probability matrix and component state prediction were
   defined. A fast derivation method of Markov state transition probability
   matrix using in system state prediction was proposed. The Matlab program
   using this method was compiled to analyze and obtain the future state
   probability distribution of grid system. As a comparison the system
   state distribution was simulated based on sequential Monte Carlo method,
   which was in good agreement with the state transition matrix, and the
   validity of the method was verified. Furthermore, the situation
   prediction of the six-node example was analyzed, which provided an
   effective prediction and analysis tool for the security situation.},

Abstract = {Real-time network applications depend on schedulers to guarantee the
   quality of service (QoS). Conventional real-time schedulers focus on the
   timing constraints but are much less effective in satisfying the
   security requirements. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
   security-aware scheduling system for packet switched networks using a
   real-time multi-agent design model. The proposed system combines
   real-time scheduling with security service enhancement. The scheduling
   unit uses the differentiated-earliest-deadline-first (Diff-EDF)
   scheduler and the security enhancement scheme adopts a congestion
   control mechanism. The required QoS is guaranteed for different types
   (audio and video) of real-time data flows, while the packet security
   levels are adaptively enhanced according to the feedbacks from the
   congestion control module. Compared with the IPsec protocol, the
   proposed scheme reduces the number of pending packets at the
   destinations. In implementation, the proposed scheme can overload the
   priority code point and the virtual-LAN identifier fields of the IEEE
   802.1Q frame format, hence eliminating the overhead of the security
   associations performed by the IPsec protocol.},

Abstract = {Collaborative autonomous systems operating at edges, e.g., TurtleBots,
   need adaptive security mechanisms (i.e., Confidentiality, Integrity,

   security platform that supports secure communication among autonomous
   systems of robots (e.g., TurtleBots), security of Robot Operating System
   (ROS) communication network, the integrity of the information exchanged
   among the robots and secured availability of the data and access to
   services. For designing the security platform, we have used architecture
   and design patterns along with the respective security protocols. Our
   solution provides seamless security incorporation in heterogeneous
   collaborative autonomous entities. We have leveraged architectural
   strategies to incorporate public-key encryption, maintain global order
   of events and incorporate fault tolerance. We assert that the presented
   security platform can facilitate easy adoption of secure control,
   communication and information gathering in collaborative autonomous
   systems with resource constraint edge nodes.},

Abstract = {Broadcast encryption schemes rely on a centralized authority to generate
   decryption keys for each user. It is observed that, when a broadcast
   encryption scheme is deployed for secret escrows, a dishonest dealer can
   read the escrowed secrets without leaving any witnesses. We present a
   new broadcast encryption paradigm referred to as fully distributed
   broadcast encryption (FDBE) without suffering from this vulnerability.
   In the new paradigm, there are multiple dealers, and by contacting a
   number of them equal to a threshold or more, any user can join the
   system; then the secrets can be encrypted to any subset of users and
   only the intended receivers can decrypt, while an attacker cannot get
   any information about the encrypted message even if the attacker
   controls all the users outside the receiver set and corrupts some
   dealers, provided that the number of corrupted dealers is less than a
   threshold. We realize the first fully distributed broadcast encryption
   scheme which is proven secure under the decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman
   Exponentiation assumption in the standard model. A variant is also shown
   to achieve sub-linear complexity in terms of public key, decryption key
   and ciphertext, comparable to up-to-date regular broadcast encryption
   schemes without robustness and strong security against misbehaving
   dealers.},

Abstract = {In allusion to the fact that the traditional off-fine security analysis
   based on the data of one time section can not adapt to the continuous
   state change of power system appropriately, a time process-oriented
   security analysis method is presented in the paper. The basic idea of
   time process-oriented method is explained. With the abundant
   measurements and load forecasting information, the characteristic vector
   of each time section is extracted. The load curve is partitioned into
   several time sub-processes by the improved K-means clustering algorithm
   considering the successive time series of power load. The indices
   extracting the maximum and minimum characteristic sections of every time
   sub-process are defined. Then the representativeness of the
   characteristic sections is verified. While ensuring the static security,
   the time process-oriented method can improve the transmission efficiency
   to some extent. The calculation and analysis of IEEE 30-bus system shows
   the effectiveness of the method proposed in the paper.},

Abstract = {The automobile seat is an important and unique device in the automobile
   system, which directly contacts the human body. The dynamic
   characteristics of the automobile seat are the key parameters for its
   vibration security and dynamic performance. Both experiments and finite
   element simulations are conducted to analyse the fore-and-aft operating
   modes of a new type of automobile seat system in this paper. The results
   and their correlation analysis between the experimental data and the
   computational models are given. By using finite element simulations, the
   computational results of the modes with the first 12 orders for the
   automobile seat are in the range 0-100 Hz, including the integral modes
   and the local modes of the automobile seat. An experimental method was
   designed to measure the seat frame mode using an impact hammer, a
   triaxial accelerometer, uniaxial accelerometers and a 24-channel LMS
   vibration test system. The experimental data were analysed by estimating
   the frequency response function and the modal parameters and validated
   using LMS Test.Lab software. The experimental results for five integral
   modal parameters of the automobile seat between 0 Hz and 100 Hz are
   given. The orthogonal experimental method is used to design nine
   different working states of the automobile seat with variations in the
   positions of different adjustable devices (the headrest, the height
   adjuster, the recliner and the track slide). Finally, the influences of
   the above-mentioned adjustable devices on the fore-and-aft operating
   mode are analysed by the single-factor analysis method using finite
   element simulations.},

Abstract = {Multimodal hearing aids (HAs) aim to deliver more intelligible audio in
   noisy environments by contextually sensing and processing data in the
   form of not only audio but also visual information (e.g. lip reading).
   Machine learning techniques can play a pivotal role for the contextual
   processing of multimodal data, however, due to the low computational
   power of the HA devices, the data must be processed either on the edge
   or cloud which, in turn, poses privacy concerns for the users' sensitive
   data. Existing literature proposes several techniques for data
   encryption but their computational complexity is a major bottleneck to
   meet strict latency requirements for the development of future
   multi-modal hearing aids. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes
   a novel real-time audio/visual data encryption scheme based on
   chaos-based encryption using the Tangent-Delay Ellipse Reflecting
   Cavity-Map System (TD-ERCS) and Non-linear Chaotic (NCA) Algorithms. The
   results achieved against different security analysis parameters such as
   Correlation Coefficient, Unified Averaged Changed Intensity (UACI), Key
   Sensitivity Analysis, Number of Changing Pixel Rate (NPCR), Mean-Square
   Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Entropy test, and

   increased key-space against modern brute-force attacks and lightweight

Abstract = {We propose new constructions for inner product encryption - IPE1 and
   IPE2, both secure under the eXternal Diffie-Hellman assumption (SXDH) in
   asymmetric pairing groups. The first scheme has constant-size
   ciphertexts whereas the second one is weakly attribute hiding. IPE2 is
   derived from the identity-based encryption scheme of Jutla Roy
   (Asiacrypt 2013), that was extended from tag-based quasi-adaptive
   non-interactive zero-knowledge (QA-NIZK) proofs for linear subspaces of
   vector spaces over bilinear groups. The verifier common reference string
   (CRS) in these tag-based systems are split into two parts, that are
   combined during verification. We consider an alternate form of the
   tag-based QA-NIZK proof with a single verifier CRS that already includes
   a tag, different from the one defining the language. The verification
   succeeds as long as the two tags are unequal. Essentially, we embed a
   two-equation revocation mechanism in the verification. The new QA-NIZK
   proof system leads to IPE1, a constant-sized ciphertext IPE scheme with
   very short ciphertexts. Both the IPE schemes are obtained by applying
   the n-equation revocation technique of Attrapadung and Libert (PKC 2010)
   to the corresponding identity based encryption schemes and proved secure
   under SXDH assumption. As an application, we show how our schemes can be
   specialised to obtain the first fully secure identity-based broadcast
   encryption based on SXDH with a trade-off among the public parameters,
   ciphertext and key sizes, all of them being sub-linear in the maximum
   number of recipients of a broadcast.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, parallel disk systems have been highly scalable and
   able to alleviate the problem of disk I/O bottleneck, thereby being
   widely used to support data-intensive applications. Although a variety
   of parallel disk systems were developed, most existing disk systems lack
   a means to adaptively control the quality of security for dynamically
   changing workloads. We address this gap in disk technology by designing,
   implementing, and evaluating a quality of security control framework for
   parallel disk systems, or ASPAD for short, that makes it possible for
   parallel disk systems to adapt to changing security requirements and
   workload conditions. The ASPAD framework comprises four major
   components, namely, a security service middleware, a dynamic
   data-partitioning mechanism, a response time estimator, and an adaptive
   security quality controller. The framework is conducive to adaptively
   and expeditiously determining security services for requests submitted
   to a parallel disk system in a way to improve security of the disk
   system while making an effort to guarantee desired response times of the
   requests. We conduct extensive experiments to quantitatively evaluate
   the performance of the proposed ASPAD framework. Empirical results show
   that ASPAD significantly improves the overall performance of parallel
   disk systems over the same disk systems without using the ASPAD
   framework. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Counting clicks and beeps: Exploring numerosity based haptic and audio

Abstract = {Haptic and audio cues now appear commonly in computer interfaces,
   partially due to inherent advantages such as their support for eyes-free
   interaction. Their invisible, unobservable nature also makes them ideal
   candidates for security interfaces in which users have to enter secret
   information such as passwords. In particular, researchers have explored
   this idea through the design of PIN entry authentication systems based
   on multi-modal combinations of visual and non-visual content or on the
   recognition of small sets of unimodal haptic or audio stimuli. This
   paper highlights the benefits and performance limitations of these
   approaches and introduces an alternative based on unimodal audio or
   haptic temporal numerosity - the ability to accurately and rapidly
   determine the number of cues presented in rapid temporal succession. In
   essence, in a numerosity interface, rather than recognizing distinct
   cues, users must count the number of times that a single cue occurs. In
   an iterative process of design and evaluation, three prototypes
   implementing this concept are presented and studies of their use
   reported. The results show the fastest PIN entry times and lowest error
   rates to be 8 s and 2\%, figures that improve substantially on previous
   research. These results are attained while maintaining low levels of
   workload and substantial resistance to observation attack (as determined
   via camera attack security studies). In sum, this paper argues that
   unimodal audio and haptic numerosity is a valuable and relatively
   unexplored metaphor for non-visual input and demonstrates the validity
   of this claim in the demanding task of unobservable authentication
   systems. (C) 2012 British Informatics Society Limited. All rights

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present a way to acquire some knowledge
   for the development of an expert system for security analysis. The paper
   discusses principally the problem of security in steady state and
   especially the problem of overloaded branches. The proposed method is
   based on a hybrid approach which includes rules and numerical
   computations to evaluate the effect of outages on the power system.
   The basic idea is to use a systematic analysis of the single
   contingencies to build a knowledge base. In real time the knowledge base
   is used to perform a single contingency analysis around the working
   point for which the base case has been calculated. The same knowledge
   base is also used to carry out a double contingency analysis at the
   working point for which it has been established. Rules are extracted by
   considering similarities between the knowledge bases obtained for
   different characteristic operating states. An advantage of the proposed
   method is that, by using filtering, it provides a general way to extract
   rules for each contingency.},

   applying FACTS device STATCOM. On normal operating state the voltage
   profiles are within. limits according to the Grid Code, but on peak load
   we might have this voltage profiles decreased. The voltage profiles on
   peak load in SS Peja1 and SS Peja2 is 13 kV and on SS Degam is 12 kV
   decreased from their nominal values. The analysis and implementation of
   the STATCOM to inject or reject reactive power might used for future

Abstract = {Authors propose a hardware based approach for reliable encryption in
   wireless network using Cellular Automata (CA). Distinct layers of
   encryption have been utilized in proposed model for enhancing data
   security. Transmitter and receiver modules are designed for performing
   state transition based encrypted activities. Transmitter module is
   required for capturing environmental turbulences (noise) from a specific
   geographical location and send encrypted signal to receiver module
   through wireless network. Receiver module analyses received signal after
   decryption for desired activities based on real time situations.
   Different hardware components are selected and compared based on market
   study targeting efficient construction of proposed modules. Time
   complexity and code break complexity are measured using different key
   lengths, keysets, and data sizes for proposed CA based encryption scheme
   achieving unique results in hardware based cryptography system.
   Encryption key length, index, and keyset are required for computing code
   break complexity in design model. Large data size is effectively managed
   to calculate protection ratio and reliability factor for realizing
   efficient protectiveness and accuracy. Comparative study between
   existing encryption technique and proposed CA based encryption technique
   is established based on time complexity and code break complexity.},

Abstract = {Sensor networks is a solid basis for the Internet of Things (IoT) to
   provide resources, business models and opportunities to build potential
   industrial systems improving manufacturing systems with efficient

Abstract = {With the improvement of industrial informatization, various industrial
   control system network protocols have also been widely used. The
   reliability of these protocols will directly affect the safety of
   industrial control systems. As an effective method that can
   automatically analyze system reliability, model checking has been widely
   used in the verification of various safety-critical systems. In this
   paper, we propose a modeling design method for industrial control
   network protocol based on time semantic reconstruction of time state
   transition matrix (TSTM). In addition, we provide a TSTM model checking
   method based on linear temporal logic (LTL). In order to effectively
   alleviate the state space explosion, the method adopts bounded model
   checking (BMC) technology. Furthermore, we implement a TSTM model
   verification tool called ICPV. Finally, we apply the above method to the
   modeling and verification of the industrial control network protocol
   Powerlink and through a comparison experiment with UPPAAL to illustrate
   the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper.},

Abstract = {The paper introduces a formal security model for a microprocessor
   hardware system. The model has been developed as part of the evaluation
   process of the processor product according to ITSEC assurance level E4.
   Novel aspects of the model are the need for defining integrity and
   confidentiality objectives on the hardware level without the operating
   system or application specification and security policy being given, and
   the utilization of an abstract function and data space. The security
   model consists of a system model given as a state transition automaton
   on infinite structures and the formalization of security objectives by
   means of properties of automaton behaviors. Validity of the security
   properties is proved. The paper compares the model with published ones
   and summarizes the lessons learned throughout the modeling process.},

Abstract = {Various underwater communication applications are proposed to maintain
   different economic, environmental, and security gains. To support the
   high quality of service (QoS) requirements of the involved communication
   tasks, one solution is to rely on multi-mode (i.e., acoustic, optical,
   magnetic induction (MI), and radio frequency (RF)) communication
   systems. Such a multi-mode communication system can take advantage of
   the complementary modes' features, to obtain QoS requirements per
   transmission flow. However, challenges including high system cost and
   coordination between different modes need to be addressed. Therefore, in
   this paper a Universal Underwater Software Defined Radio ( UniSDR)
   architecture is proposed that realizes joint operation of different
   modes, in order to deal with the latest use cases demands. Detailed
   description of the UniSDR architecture is presented. Novelty of the
   architecture provides flexibility, allowing designer to build a radio
   that includes any set of modes, which can operate jointly by exchanging
   data, control and synchronization. A numerical evaluation is conducted
   to assess the performance of the proposed UniSDR architecture. It
   clearly shows that the utilization of UniSDR allows to decrease the
   transmission latency and improve energy efficiency, while maintaining
   the reliability and robustness.},

Journal = {NANO RESEARCH},

Volume = {13},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Optical silicon (Si)-based materials are highly attractive due to their
   widespread applications ranging from electronics to biomedicine. It is
   worth noting that while extensive efforts have been devoted to
   developing fluorescent Si-based structures, there currently exist no
   examples of Si-based materials featuring phosphorescence emission,
   severely limiting Si-based wide-ranging optical applications. To address
   this critical issue, we herein introduce a kind of Si-based material, in
   which metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are in-situ growing on the surface
   of Si nanoparticles (SiNPs) assisted by microwave irradiation. Of
   particular significance, the resultant materials, i.e.,
   MOFs-encapsulated SiNPs (MOFs@SiNPs) could exhibit pH-responsive
   fluorescence, whose maximum emission wavelength is red-shifted from 442
   to 592 nm when the pH increases from 2 to 13. More importantly, distinct
   room-temperature phosphorescence (maximum emission wavelength: 505 nm)
   could be observed in this system, with long lifetime of 215 ms. Taking
   advantages of above-mentioned unique optical properties, the MOFs@SiNPs
   are further employed as high-quality anti-counterfeiting inks for
   advanced encryption. In comparison to conventional fluorescence
   anti-counterfeiting techniques (static fluorescence outputs are
   generally used, thus being easily duplicated and leading to
   counterfeiting risk), pH-responsive fluorescence and room-temperature
   phosphorescence of the resultant MOFs@SiNPs-based ink could offer
   advanced multi-modal security, which is therefore capable of realizing
   higher-level information security against counterfeiting.},

Journal = {IIE TRANSACTIONS},

Volume = {40},

Pages = {122-132},
Abstract = {The computation of the reliability of weighted voting systems is an
   important problem in reliability theory due to its potential application
   in security, target identification, safety and monitoring areas. Voting
   systems are used in a wide variety of applications where an acceptance
   or rejection decision has to be made about a binary proposition
   presented to the system. For these systems, it is of interest to obtain
   the probability so that based on the vote of decision-making units, the
   system aggregates these votes into the right decision when presented
   with such a proposition. This paper presents a holistic work on weighted
   voting system reliability by presenting modeling, computation,
   estimation and optimization techniques. The modeling part takes
   advantage of the structure of weighted voting systems to present a model
   of its reliability as a multi-state system. Next, based on the
   multi-state view of the system, an exact computational approach based on
   multi-state minimal cut and path vectors is introduced. The paper then
   acknowledges the computational complexity of the problem and provides a
   Monte Carlo simulation approach that estimates system reliability
   accurately and in an efficient computational time. Finally, an
   optimization heuristic that generates quasi-optimal solutions is
   presented that is able to solve the problem of maximizing the
   reliability of a weighted voting system based on a specified number of
   decision- making units with known reliability characteristics.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a two-stage multi-mode data-driven Volt/Var
   optimization-based conservation voltage reduction (VVO/CVR) strategy to
   reduce total energy consumption while mitigating fast voltage violations
   in distribution networks. In the first stage, optimal power flow (OPF)
   is performed in the central controller (CC) to obtain day-ahead dispatch
   results of on-load tap changers (OLTC) and capacitor banks (CBs) based
   forecasting data of PV and load. In the second stage, a multi-mode
   data-driven local control strategy is designed in real-time Volt/Var
   control (VVC) with three operation modes, which are energy saving mode,
   reactive power reservation mode and security operation mode
   respectively. The coordination and transition among different control
   modes allow system operators to achieve both energy savings and voltage
   security under various conditions. The flexible reactive power margin of
   PVs can also be adaptively improved through cooperation with CBs.
   Moreover, a data-driven deep convolution neural network (CNN) is
   developed and trained as a local controller (LC) to regulate the
   reactive power of PVs based on local measurements. The influence of
   input selections on training losses is analyzed in detail, and a
   clustering-based data preprocessing method is also proposed to simplify
   the training process without compromising the training performance. The
   proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system and
   simulation results verify the effectiveness both in saving energy and
   addressing voltage problems.},

Abstract = {The paper introduces a formal security model for a microprocessor
   hardware system. The model has been developed as part of the evaluation
   process of the processor product according to ITSEC assurance level E4.
   Novel aspects of the model are the need for defining integrity and
   confidentiality objectives on the hardware level without the operating
   system or application specification and security policy being given, and
   the utilisation of an abstract function and data space. The security
   model consists of a system model given as a state transition automaton
   on infinite structures, and the formalisation of security objectives by
   means of properties of automaton behaviours. Validity of the security
   properties is proved. The paper compares the model with published ones
   and summarises the lessons learned throughout the modelling process.},

Abstract = {During power system operations, the system operators are often
   struggling with identifying the dynamic operating security modes of the
   system in a fast, accurate and reliable manner. The system security
   constraints are in fact boundaries that surround all possible operating
   modes (scenarios) of the power system. In other words, these boundaries
   form the feasible operating domain - in the parameter space spanned by
   various operating variables - within which the system can safely be
   operated. For a given operating scenario, the associated security level
   is measured by the ``distance{''} (for example, the Euclidean norm) of
   the operating point from the security region boundary. This paper
   reports on the results of a recently completed research and development
   paper, which included the development of innovative computerized
   schemes, which are capable of identifying dynamic operating security
   modes during the on-line operation of electric power systems. The
   methodology adopted in this paper includes the development of advanced,
   highly efficient computerized algorithms for fast identification of
   dynamic operating security modes of power systems. One of the salient
   outcomes of this paper is the development of a novel framework for
   identification and representation of operating security regions in power
   systems as well as evaluation of security levels associated with
   different operating scenarios. While the concepts and principles
   presented are general, the work of this paper is confined to the
   interpretation of the security boundary in terms of system stability
   criteria. Of course, the framework presented is applicable quite as well
   to other criteria that may be considered.},

   research activities are regularly stored in three significantly

   Additional features of the described system include (1) the use of Grid

   framework intended to address both potential security and patient
   confidentiality concerns that arise when transmitting or otherwise

Abstract = {Boneh, Waters and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2014) used multilinear maps to provide
   a solution to the long-standing problem of public-key broadcast
   encryption (BE) where all parameters in the system are small. In this
   work, we improve their result by providing a solution that uses only
   bilinear maps and Learning With Errors (LWE). Our scheme is fully
   collusion-resistant against any number of colluders, and can be
   generalized to an identity-based broadcast system with short parameters.
   Thus, we reclaim the problem of optimal broadcast encryption from the
   land of ``Obfustopia{''}.
   Our main technical contribution is a ciphertext policy attribute based
   encryption (CP-ABE) scheme which achieves special efficiency properties
   - its ciphertext size, secret key size, and public key size are all
   independent of the size of the circuits supported by the scheme. We show
   that this special CP-ABE scheme implies BE with optimal parameters; but
   it may also be of independent interest. Our constructions rely on a
   novel interplay of bilinear maps and LWE, and are proven secure in the
   generic group model.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of transparently authenticating a
   user to a local terminal (e.g., a desktop computer) as she approaches
   towards the terminal. Given its appealing usability, such zero-effort
   authentication has already been deployed in the real-world where a
   computer terminal or a vehicle can be unlocked by the mere proximity of
   an authentication token (e.g., a smartphone). However, existing systems
   based on a single authentication factor contains one major security
   weakness - unauthorized physical access to the token, e.g., during
   lunch-time or upon theft, allows the attacker to have unfettered access
   to the terminal.
   We introduce ZEMFA, a zero-effort multi-factor authentication system
   based on multiple authentication tokens and multi-modal behavioral
   biometrics. Specifically, ZEMFA utilizes two types of authentication
   tokens, a smartphone and a smartwatch (or a bracelet) and two types of
   gait patterns captured by these tokens, mid/lower body movements
   measured by the phone and wrist/arm movements captured by the watch.
   Since a user's walking or gait pattern is believed to be unique, only
   that user (no impostor) would be able to gain access to the terminal
   even when the impostor is given access to both of the authentication
   tokens. We present the design and implementation of ZEMFA. We
   demonstrate that ZEMFA offers a high degree of detection accuracy, based
   on multi-sensor and multi-device fusion. We also show that ZEMFA can
   resist active attacks that attempt to mimic a user's walking pattern,
   especially when multiple devices are used.},

   hidden Markov model is expanded from five-tuple to seven-tuple, and two
   parameters of network defense efficiency and risk loss vector are added
   so that the model can describe network security situation more
   completely. Then, an initial algorithm of state transition matrix was
   defined, observation vectors were extracted from the fusion of various
   system security detection data, the network state transition matrix was
   created and modified by the observation vectors, and a solution
   procedure of the hidden state probability distribution sequence based on
   extended hidden Markov model was derived. Finally, a method of
   calculating risk loss vector according to the international definition
   was designed and the current network risk value was calculated by the
   hidden state probability distribution; then the global security
   situation was assessed. The experiment showed that the model satisfied
   practical applications and the assessment result is accurate and
   effective.},

Abstract = {In the context of internet of things, mobile operators face the
   challenge to host millions of devices with various capabilities and
   intelligence. With the traditional connectivity management in Long Term
   Evolution / Evolved Packet System (LTE/EPS) networks, security services
   such as confidentiality and integrity protection are designed to be
   activated in a systematic manner leading to significant signaling and
   processing cost. Therefore, new strategies need to be devised for
   cost-effective security provision. In this paper, we motivate the
   integration of a context-aware security controller into LTE/EPS networks
   to minimize the overall security cost. This controller activates
   security mechanisms according to the contextual information such as the
   application type and the device capabilities. By means of detailed
   quantitative analysis, we evaluate the processing cost associated to
   each security service. We demonstrate that the gain that is achieved in
   terms of processing cost justify taking additional complexity to support
   adaptive security mechanisms.},

Abstract = {Malicious lateral movement-based attacks have become a potential risk
   for many systems, bringing highly likely threats to critical
   infrastructures and national security. When launching this kind of
   attacks, adversaries first compromise a fraction of the targeted system
   and then move laterally to the rest of the system until the whole system
   is infected. Various approaches were proposed to study and/or defend
   against lateral movement-based attacks. However, few of them studied
   transient behaviors of dynamic attacking and dynamic targeted systems.
   This paper aims to analyze the transient security of a dynamic network
   system under lateral movement-based attacks from the time that
   attack-related abnormity in the system is detected until mechanisms are
   designed and deployed to defend against attacks. We explore state-space
   modeling techniques to construct a survivability model for quantitative
   analysis. A phased piecewise constant approximation approach is also
   proposed to derive the formulas for calculating model state transient
   probabilities, with which we derive formulas for calculating metrics of
   interest. The proposed approach allows both model state transition rates
   and the number of model states to be time-varying during the system
   recovery. Numerical analysis is carried out for investigating the impact
   of various dynamic system parameters on system security.},

Abstract = {Cloud Computing, SDN and virtual networking technologies have completely
   modified the relationship between the applications and the hardware
   resources that are used to execute them. They are no more tightly
   coupled to each other in a static context. However, elastic on-demand
   provisioning, auto-scaling and migration provided by cloud resources to
   address fluctuations in workload demands or available resource pools
   also bring with them new issues in managing security. In this paper, the
   authors propose a novel security system based on the concept of
   cognitive control overlay to proactively manage the security of service
   transactions. In particular, when the application components move, their
   configuration changes and the conventional intrusion detection systems
   (IDS) not aware of the mobility will fail. The cognitive overlay makes
   the IDS become aware of the mobility and take appropriate action. The
   solution addresses application security independent of server and
   network based security management systems.},

Abstract = {Self-adaptive security methods have been extensively leveraged for
   securing software systems and users from runtime threats in online and
   elastic environments, such as the cloud. The existing solutions treat
   security as an aggregated quality by enforcing ``one service for all{''}
   without considering the explicit security requirements of each asset or
   the costs associated with security. Dealing with the security of assets
   in ultra-large environments calls for rethinking the way we select and
   compose services-considering not only the services but the underlying
   supporting computational resources in the process. We motivate the need
   for an asset-centric, self-adaptive security framework that selects and
   allocates services and underlying resources in the cloud. The solution
   leverages learning algorithms and market-inspired approaches to
   dynamically manage changes in the runtime security goals/requirements of
   assets with the provision of suitable services and resources, while
   catering for monetary and computational constraints. The proposed
   framework aims to inform the self-adaptive security efforts of security
   researchers and practitioners operating in dynamic large-scale
   environments, such as the Cloud. To illustrate the utility of the
   proposed framework it is evaluated using simulation on an application
   based scenario, involving cloud-based storage and security services.},

Abstract = {The main challenge in building efficient broadcast systems is to encrypt
   messages with short ciphertexts. The well-known constructions of
   identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) with constant size
   ciphertexts in the standard model are based on the non-standard
   cryptography assumption. In addition, these constructions cannot solve
   the trade-off between the private keys and ciphertexts. These folklore
   construction methods lead to schemes that are somewhat inefficient and
   leave open the problem of finding more efficient direct constructions.
   In this paper, we give a secure identity-based broadcast encryption
   scheme with a constant-size ciphertext and private keys. It is
   constructed by using dual techniques in the subgroups. The proposed
   scheme achieves the full security (adaptive security) under three static
   (i.e. non q-based) assumptions. It is worth noting that only recently
   Waters's scheme achieves adaptive security under simple assumptions. One
   feature of our scheme is that it is relatively simple to get adaptive
   security. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {As business is getting sensitive to knowledge, the importance of the
   business contents that has business information and knowledge is rapidly
   increasing. Moreover, this business information includes diverse
   sensitive data, which should be handled in secured way.
   In sociological terms and information technical terms, it is important
   to have attention for the phenomenon that occurred in South Korea. Over
   the last decade in South Korea, many firms have been trying to equip
   some specialized security system for their internal content, which is
   known as `Document (Contents) Centralization System'.
   This `Document Centralization System' business became one of the biggest
   and hottest businesses in the area of Enterprise Contents Management
   Business and Contents Security Business in South Korea. Surprisingly,
   this system doesn't have any specialized security technologies.
   Moreover, it is not limited to digital security technology, but also
   some industrial security consideration based on business behavior.
   Additionally, this system needs the concept of serviced security.
   In order to understand this phenomenon and system effectively, it is not
   enough only to study information technology and security. Except for
   individual security technologies, we need to study other many sub
   themes, such as knowledge contents business, business behavior pattern
   in terms of industrial security, smart work business and knowledge
   product service system.
   Finally, this paper presented the adaptive security system in terms of
   management of technology, which means that security need to be managed ;
   not installed.. This system has diverse characteristics, such as the
   convergence capability of digital security technologies, flexible system
   mechanism corresponding to business behavior and effective cloud system
   which is capable of servicing of knowledge contents.},

Abstract = {At present, there are few security models which control the
   communication between virtual machines (VMs). Moreover, these models are
   not applicable to multi-level security (MLS). In order to implement
   mandatory access control (MAC) and MLS in virtual machine system, this
   paper designs Virt-BLP model, which is based on BLP model. For the
   distinction between virtual machine system and non-virtualized system,
   we build elements and security axioms of Virt-BLP model by modifying
   those of BLP. Moreover, comparing with BLP, the number of state
   transition rules of Virt-BLP is reduced accordingly and some rules can
   only be enforced by trusted subject. As a result, Virt-BLP model
   supports MAC and partial discretionary access control (DAC), well
   satisfying the requirement of MLS in virtual machine system. As space is
   limited, the implementation of our MAC framework will be shown in a
   continuation.},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present an adaptively secure identity-based broadcast
   encryption system featuring constant sized ciphertext in the standard
   model. The size of the public key and the private keys of our system are
   both linear in the maximum number of receivers. In addition, our system
   is fully collusion-resistant and has stateless receivers. Compared with
   the state-of-the-art, our scheme is well optimized for the broadcast
   encryption. The computational complexity of decryption of our scheme
   depends only on the number of receivers, not the maximum number of
   receivers of the system. Technically, we employ dual system encryption
   technique and our proposal offers adaptive security under the general
   subgroup decisional assumption. Our scheme demonstrates that the
   adaptive security of the schemes utilizing a composite order group can
   be proven under the general subgroup decisional assumption, while many
   existing systems working in a composite order group are secure under
   multiple subgroup decision assumptions. We note that this finding is of
   an independent interest, which may be useful in other scenarios.},

Abstract = {System-on-chip (SoC) architectures are a heterogeneous mix of
   microprocessors, custom accelerators, memories, interfaces, peripherals,
   and other resources. These resources communicate using complex on-chip
   interconnect networks that attempt to quickly and efficiently arbitrate
   memory transactions whose behaviors can vary drastically depending on
   the current mode of operation and system operating state. Security- and
   safety-critical applications require access control policies that define
   how these resources interact to ensure that malicious and unsafe
   behaviors do not occur. Aker is a design and verification framework for
   on-chip access control. The core of Aker is the access control wrapper
   (ACW)-a high-performance yet efficient hardware module that dynamically
   arbitrates on-chip communications. Aker distributes ACWs across the SoC
   and programs them to perform local access control. Aker provides a
   firmware generation tool and a property-driven security verification
   methodology to ensure that the ACWs are properly integrated and
   configured. Aker security verification confirms that the ACW behaves
   properly at IP level. It verifies the hardware root of trust firmware
   configures the ACW correctly. And it evaluates system-level security
   threats due to interactions between shared resources. Aker is
   experimentally validated on a Xilinx UltraScale+ programmable SoC.
   Additionally, an Aker access control system is integrated into the
   OpenPULP multicore archtiecture that uses OpenTitan hardware
   root-of-trust for firmware configuration.},

Abstract = {In the SECREDAS project, the car-sharing system embodies one of the
   laboratory demonstrators (pilots). The system consists of an embedded
   device for car access, a backend server, and a mobile app. In addition,
   the system can be easily adapted to an access control system in general,
   such as car fleet management. Our team designed, implemented, and
   validated the system in a laboratory environment, therefore TRL
   (Technology Readiness Level) 4 was achieved. The implementation was also
   supported by design patterns developed in the project. Moreover, we
   addressed the security, safety, and privacy issues. This article reports
   the progress of work and the results achieved. Key aspects such as
   Identity management, Representative State Transfer (REST) API
   (Application Programming Interface), threat assessment and key transfer
   methods are also described in more detail. In this work, the symmetric
   rent token (car key) is heavily used; however, other techniques are

Abstract = {This paper presents the application of the Software as a Service (SaaS)
   approach of software streaming. Streaming refers to downloading software
   to client hardware platforms for temporary local execution. OS and
   application software is managed from a centralized server and provided
   only on-demand. Users obtain a clean, consistent, current build each
   time they log in, removing the nuisance of security patching and
   rebooting for environmental changes. Local execution and caching
   preserves user experience comparable to traditionally installed
   applications.
   To explore feasibility, Intel conducted a Proof-of-Concept (POC) to
   evaluate streaming in its call center and manufacturing environments on
   multi-user systems. The four-part study included performance, usability,
   IT operations and total cost of ownership (TCO). The proof-of-concept
   was successful in identifying streaming as a feasible technology with
   good performance and positive TCO in the tested scenarios. The biggest
   benefits were related to locking down the client and thus eliminating
   service calls related to configuration changes, software installation
   and viruses. The major challenges encountered were around the high
   learning curve and the software maturity related to packing applications
   for streaming. Based on the strong positive outcome of the POC, Intel
   has added streaming to its IT roadmaps.},

   which rules derived from a decision tree learner are used to determine
   the necessary control actions to make an insecure power system state
   secure. A representative set of system operating states are classified
   as transiently stable or unstable by the Extended Equal Area Criterion
   (EEAC) for fast evaluation of transient stability and used as a training
   set for the decision tree, which outputs a set of classification rules.
   Security control is achieved by selecting optimal control actions to
   change the current, insecure state into a state within a secure region,
   without violating the acquired security rules. The technique is
   demonstrated on the 39 bus New England test system.},

Abstract = {Embedded devices based on emerging technologies of the Internet of
   Things (IoT) are used to provide resources, business models and
   opportunities to build potential industrial systems improving
   manufacturing systems with efficient operations. In this context, IoT
   networks are dynamic environments and changes are also being
   increasingly frequent, modifying the environment execution.
   Nevertheless, severe threats will increase the complexity and difficulty
   to protect existing vulnerabilities in smart devices of IoT network. In
   this context, this work proposes an architecture of the ontology-based
   security framework to decision-making using adaptive security model to
   improve secure information for the industrial systems. IoTSec ontology
   contributes to feed the system using queries of contextual information
   collected in the environment. The main contribution of this approach is
   validated as an integration with C2NET project to ensure security
   properties in some critical scenarios.},

Abstract = {Efficient contingency screening and ranking method has gained importance
   in modern power systems for its secure operation. This paper proposes
   two artificial neural networks namely multi-layer feed forward neural
   network (MFNN) and radial basis function network (RBFN) to realize the
   online power system static security assessment (PSSSA) module. To assess
   the severity of the system, two indices have been used, namely active
   power performance index and voltage performance index, which are
   computed using Newton Raphson load flow (NRLF) analysis for variable
   loading conditions under N - 1 line outage contingencies. The proposed
   MFNN and RBFN models based PSSSA module, are fed with power system
   operating states, load conditions and N - 1 line outage contingencies as
   input features to train the neural network models, to predict the
   performance indices for unseen network conditions and rank them in
   descending order based on performance indices for security assessment.
   The proposed approaches are tested on standard IEEE 30-bus test system,
   where the simulation results prove its performance and robustness for
   power system static security assessment. The comparison of severity
   obtained by the neural network models and the NRLF analysis in terms of
   time and accuracy, signifies that the proposed model is quick, accurate
   and robust for power system static security evaluation for unseen
   network conditions. Thus, the proposed PSSSA module implemented using
   MFNN and RBFN models are found to be feasible for online implementation.

Abstract = {Online dynamic stability analysis plays a key role in modern power
   systems and is becoming even more vital with the penetration of
   Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). Identification of an accurate
   lower-order model for the `external system' makes it possible to carry
   out the stability analysis of a study system faster than the analysis
   for the original detailed system. However, the identified lower-order
   model becomes invalid when the operating state changes in the power
   system. `Black box' representation of the `external system' with the
   application of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is widely discussed in the
   literature. In such equivalent models, the DNN response changes based on
   two aspects i.e. the operating point of the power system and the
   location/type of the fault. In this paper, a clustering algorithm is
   proposed to identify the clusters of the `external system' models for
   different states of the power system, and a DNN is trained for each
   cluster. The clustering algorithm is based on the pre-fault steady-state
   power flow from the `external system' to the `study system', which is a
   reflection of changes in the system state. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   between responses of the actual fault and the predicted fault is used to
   evaluate the accuracy of the identified system. The proposed technique
   is easy to implement and requires a lesser number of DNN models compared
   to identifying an individual DNN model for each operating point to
   represent the `external system'.},

Abstract = {In modern power system, a single fault seldom leads to the catastrophe
   like blackout, but often causes other faults, which result in cascading
   failures and blackouts. Therefore simulate the cascading process of
   power system is more meaningful than a single device contingency
   analysis. Against such backgrounds, this paper proposes a method for
   cascading failure simulation with static security analysis method, which
   considers the load variation during the fault. The method is divided
   into two steps: firstly, a self-adapting step is figured out with the
   climbing rate of the daily load curve, and secondly, the power flow at
   the self-adapting step, which is used to judge if another fault or even
   the cascading event has happened is calculated. In this way, the process
   of cascading failure can be simulated and monitored, which is beneficial
   for the operators to obtain the operating state of the power system in
   time and adopt appropriate measures to prevent the system from
   deteriorating into a large-scale blackout accidents. Finally, the
   standard IEEE 30-bus testing system is adopted to verify the correctness
   of the method.},

Abstract = {Researchers are becoming more and more interested in the security issues
   of software engineering. It will effectively reduce the cost of
   development and maintenance in order to detect and predict security
   threats. In this paper, attack patterns are analysed in the field of
   software engineering, and Bayesian Networks is applied to construct
   attack networks topology, to find the dependencies of attack patterns.
   It helps to find the vulnerable points, locate the path of security
   threats effectively, and predict probable attacks reasonably. We use
   multi-variant statistical analysis for the attack networks, and factor
   analysis is applied to reduce the relevance. In Dirichlet distribution,
   the state transition distribution of each attack node is calculated to
   detect and predict the security threats. In order to verify the
   effectiveness and robustness of the approach, buffer flow is chosen as
   the analysis domain, and 14 attack patterns are selected for the
   experiments. It shows that attack patterns are effectively modelled
   based on Bayesian Networks and potential attack patterns are discovered,
   while threats are predicted and located accurately.},

Abstract = {In the context of the clean energy revolution and the high penetration
   of renewables and power electronics, data-driven Transient Security
   Assessment (TSA) models can significantly reduce the computational
   burden of power system TSA and adapt to the quickly changing operating
   states of modern power systems. In this paper, a multi-channel time
   series data mining framework is proposed to enhance the performance of
   data-driven TSA models. During the training procedures, a Lagrangian
   dual framework is adopted to enhance the feature extraction ability of
   different types of disturbed system trajectories. The proposed method is
   adopted to an ordinary Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and numerical
   tests are carried out in the IEEE-39 system. The test results show that
   the proposed method can effectively improve the performance and
   generalization ability of the data-driven TSA model. (C) 2022 Published

Abstract = {power grid is the most involved human-made system. Designing energy
   efficient security protocol first requires an understanding of and data
   related to the energy consumption of common encryption schemes.
   Providing time-synchronized data of power system operating states, WAMS
   will play a vital role in next generation smart grid protection and
   control. WAMS helps efficient energy transmission as well as reliable
   and optimal grid management. Security algorithms for power grid need to
   consider both performance and energy efficiency through code
   optimization techniques on encryption and decryption. In this paper, we
   take power nodes (sites) as platforms to experimentally study ways of
   energy consumptions in different security algorithms. First, we measure
   energy consumptions of various security algorithms on Cross Bow and
   Ember sensor nodes. Second, we propose an array of novel code
   optimization methods to increase energy consumption efficiency of
   different security algorithms. And then, we compare the results of first
   experiments (AES) and RC4, two energy efficient symmetric key algorithms
   that are commonly suggested or used in WLANs. Our results show that RC4
   is more suitable for large packets and AES for small packets. Finally,
   based on careful analysis of measurement results},

Abstract = {This work addresses the functional approach to ensuring cyber resiliency
   as a kind of adaptive security management. For this purpose, we propose
   a learning automaton model capable of self-learning and adapting to
   changes while interacting with the external environment. Each node in
   the under-controlled system has a set of probable actions with respect
   to neighboring nodes. The same actions are represented in the graph of
   the learning automaton, but the probabilities of actions in the graph
   model are permanently updated based on the received reinforcement
   signals. Due to the adaptive reconfiguration of the nodes, the system is
   able to counteract the cyberattacks, preserving resiliency. The
   experimental study results for the emulated wireless sensor network
   (WSN) are presented and discussed. The packets loss rate stays below
   20\% when the number of malicious nodes is 20\% of the total number of
   nodes, while the common system loses more than 70\% of packets. The
   network uptime with the proposed solution is 30\% longer; the legitimate
   nodes detect malicious nodes and rebuild their interaction with them,
   thereby saving their energy. The proposed mechanism allows ensuring the
   security and functional sustainability of the protected system
   regardless of its complexity and mission.},

Abstract = {Parallel disk systems, which have been widely used in building networked
   and data intensive applications, are highly scalable and can alleviate
   the problem of disk I/O bottleneck. Although a number of parallel disk
   systems have been developed, the systems lack a means to optimize
   quality of security for dynamically changing networked environments. We
   remedy this situation by proposing an adaptive quality of security
   control scheme for networked parallel disk systems (or ASPAD for short)
   that makes it possible for networked disk systems to adapt to changing
   security requirements and workload conditions. ASPAD is carried out in
   three phases: dynamic data partitioning, response time estimation, and
   adaptive security quality control. Hence, ASPAD is conducive to
   adaptively and expeditiously determining security schemes for disk
   requests in a way to improve security of networked parallel disk systems
   while making an effort to guarantee desired response times of the
   requests To prove the efficiency of the proposed approach, we simulate a
   networked parallel disk system into which nine cryptographic schemes are
   integrated. Empirical results show that ASPAD significantly improves
   overall performance over an existing strategy with an average of 65\%.},

Abstract = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is an advanced cryptographic tool and
   useful to build various types of access control systems. Toward the goal
   of making ABE more practical, we propose key-policy (KP) and
   ciphertext-policy (CP) ABE schemes, which first support unbounded sizes
   of attribute sets and policies with negation and multi-use of
   attributes, allow fast decryption, and are adaptively secure under a
   standard assumption, simultaneously. Our schemes are more expressive
   than previous schemes and efficient enough. To achieve the adaptive
   security along with the other properties, we refine the technique
   introduced by Kowalczyk and Wee (Eurocrypt'19) so that we can apply the
   technique more expressive ABE schemes. Furthermore, we also present a
   new proof technique that allows us to remove redundant elements used in
   their ABE schemes. We implement our schemes in 128-bit security level
   and present their benchmarks for an ordinary personal computer and
   smartphones. They show that all algorithms run in one second with the
   personal computer when they handle any policy or attribute set with one
   hundred attributes.},

Abstract = {The great efficiency and dependability of cloud computing enhance the
   efficiency of mining and analyzing large data in education. Big data in
   education have been more prevalent in the cloud environment, and the
   efficiency of data processing has been greatly enhanced, elevating the
   significance of big data in education and teaching practice. However,
   the promotion of education big data in the cloud environment has
   revealed an increasing number of issues. People pay increasing attention
   to the security of big data in education, i.e., whether big data in
   education can be safely maintained, retrieved, and utilized in the cloud
   environment. It focuses on the relationships between education big data
   producers, users, and cloud service providers. The primary topics of
   this article are, therefore, how to govern the connections between the
   three parties, the adoption of stringent technical means, and the
   establishment of data use guidelines and a regulatory structure.
   Consequently, this paper investigated the multimodal information fusion
   technology and the data security model of education in colleges and
   universities, as well as constructing a cognitive psychological model
   for education in colleges and universities based on multimodal
   information fusion and conducting experimental research on it. The
   research showed that under the cognitive psychology mode of education in

Abstract = {Grid operating security studies are typically employed to establish
   operating boundaries, ensuring secure and stable operation for a range
   of operation under NERC guidelines. However, if these boundaries are
   violated, the existing system security margins will be largely unknown.
   As an alternative to the use of complex optimizations over dynamic
   conditions, this work employs the use of Reinforcement-based Machine
   Learning to identify a sequence of secure state transitions which place
   the grid in a higher degree of operating security with greater static
   and dynamic stability margins. The approach requires the training of a
   Machine Learning Agent to accomplish this task using modeled data and
   employs it as a decision support tool under severe, near-blackout
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Self-adaptive systems have received great attention in the last decade.
   In the context of self-adaptive systems, adaptive security concerns with
   adjusting protection mechanisms at runtime while changes occur in the
   operating environment. One of the challenges with self-adaptation
   paradigm is that the reasoning engine must leverage existing
   requirements and constraints and at the same time deal with different
   types of imperfections due to absence of knowledge or data. The problem
   arises when the existing runtime requirements models offer no explicit
   support for imperfections. By imperfections, we mean the values of some
   attributes of interest are not available at certain points. To address
   this problem, we propose uncertain reasoning based on imperfect
   requirements using non-monotonic logic. We model security requirements,
   system executions and changes in operation environment through
   non-monotonic logic that explicitly represents imperfect information and
   accounts for uncertainty.},

Abstract = {Intel recently introduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to enable
   applications to protect their selected code and data from privileged
   platform software. As it draws wider attention from the security
   research community, an open-source emulator for SGX (OpenSGX) has been
   developed to allow researchers to explore the SGX environment. To the
   best of our knowledge, OpenSGX is currently the only publicly available
   SGX emulation platform; however, its system-level support is largely
   limited owing to its user-mode emulation. In particular, experiments
   that require system functionalities or device emulation cannot be
   conducted with the current OpenSGX. To solve this problem, we propose
   System-OpenSGX (S-OpenSGX), which leverages QEMU's system emulation to
   provide researchers with full system-level support for exploring SGX
   enclave-based programming. In this paper, we show the design of
   S-OpenSGX, including system functionalities such as scheduling,
   multithreading, page table handling, and SGX paging. Non-trivial issues
   derived from the difference between user-mode and system emulation, and
   our approaches to addressing them are also described. Lastly, we utilize
   S-OpenSGX to experiment with a new mitigation method against the data
   leaking attack on enclave threads and an APIC (Advanced Programmable
   Interrupt Controller) device modification to reduce SGX's mode switch
   overhead. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the context of the clean energy revolution and the high penetration
   of renewables and power electronics, the uncertainty level of operating
   states significantly increases, which brings new challenges to the safe
   and stable operation of power grids. Power system preventive control is
   an important measure to ensure the safe and stable operation of power
   systems by adjusting the active generation and nodal voltage of
   generators. In this paper, a power system preventive control algorithm
   aided by a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Transient Security
   Assessment (TSA) surrogate is proposed. A GNN-based fast contingency
   scanning model is constructed based on power network topology, which can
   predict the contingency scanning results rapidly only based on the power
   flow by transforming the original contingency scanning problem into the
   node classification problem on the GNN. The obtained GNN is then used as
   a surrogate model for TSA to speed up the solution of particle swarm
   optimization-based transient security-constrained optimal power flow.
   Numerical Tests are carried out in the IEEE-39 system and the test
   results indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve the
   efficiency without affecting the solution accuracy. (C) 2022 The

Abstract = {Discovering and identifying system changes caused by events such as
   software installation and updates, configuration changes, and security
   patches are important functionalities for change management, security,
   compliance and problem diagnosis in emerging cloud platforms. Currently,
   most discovery tools use manually written rules, which require specific
   knowledge of software and systems. Approaches based on manually written
   rules are often fragile and require constant maintenance in this era of
   continuous integration. In this paper, we propose a novel ``discovery by
   example{''} approach to autonomously search for and identify system
   changes. Our approach learns characteristic features of system changes
   automatically, without requiring any explicit rule definitions or
   specific knowledge of the underlying software or systems. In this
   approach, given a system change, our method searches a repository that
   contains previous stored system changes and returns those that are
   similar to it. We further explore the use of various forms of
   ``fingerprints{''} to represent system changes efficiently and
   faithfully in a compact manner. We propose and evaluate two types of
   fingerprints: the ``basename fingerprint{''} and the ``1-D histogram
   fingerprint{''}. We show that both fingerprints exhibit different
   efficiency and accuracy trade-offs, and they can be effectively employed
   in different use cases. We evaluate the performance of our approach with
   both techniques and further present an application of it in system
   real-time streaming monitoring.},

Abstract = {A majority of recent large-scale blackouts have been the consequence of
   instabilities characterized by sudden voltage collapse phenomena. This
   paper presents a method for voltage instability monitoring in a power
   system with a hybrid artificial neural network which consist of a
   multilayer perceptron and the Kohonen neural network. The proposed
   method has a couple of the following functions: the Kohonen network is
   used to classify the system operating state; the Kohonen output patterns
   are used as inputs to train of a multilayer perceptron for
   identification of alarm states that are dangerous for the system
   security. The approach is targeting a blackout prevention scheme; given
   that the blackout signal is captured before it can collapse the power
   system. The proposed method is realized in R and demonstrated the
   modified IEEE One Area RTS-96 power system.},

Title = {Efficient dynamic threshold identity-based encryption with constant-size
   ciphertext},

Abstract = {This paper revisits the notion of dynamic threshold identity-based
   encryption, due to the recent practical interest. In this notion, an
   encryptor selects n recipients and a threshold value t for the creation
   of the ciphertext. The plaintext can only be recovered if at least t
   receivers cooperate. The key issue in this notion is its dynamicity,
   where after the users enroll to the system, the sender can dynamically
   select the set of recipients as well as dynamically set the threshold t
   upon the creation of the ciphertext. Another essential feature of this
   notion is the need for a constant-size ciphertext. Interestingly, the
   work by Delerablee and Pointcheval in Crypto 2008 is the only work that
   achieves this essential feature. In this work, we propose a new scheme
   achieving all of these nice properties with significant improvements in
   terms of the computational efficiency (both the encryption and
   decryption). In our scheme, there is no need to conduct any encryption
   and decryption using additional dummy users, which are not part of the
   recipient group, which is in contrast to Delerablee and Pointcheval's
   work. This improvement has significantly reduced the amount of
   computations required in both encryption and decryption algorithms. (C)

   System for Long-Term Cyber-Security Risk Evaluation},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {178605-178617},
Abstract = {Through virus-based reconnaissances, the attacker may compromise
   critical power substations and induce power outages. Meanwhile, the
   power system operator may conduct defensive measures to prevent
   virus-spreading. In this paper, a graphical evolutionary game model is
   developed to solve the equilibrium of competitions between virus
   propagations and countermeasures, which helps to evaluate the
   cyber-security risk of power systems under long-term virus-based
   intrusions. In the proposed game model, the virus is supposed to
   propagate itself in a cyber network connecting cyber nodes belonging to
   power substations. Each cyber node may play as an attacker or a defender
   according to its state. A death-birth rule is adopted to model
   probabilistic strategies and state transfers, which reflects the bounded
   rationality of the viruses. Then, an evolution dynamic equation is
   derived to obtain the portion of the infected substations when the
   equilibrium is reached, and simulation algorithm is also given to
   estimate the infection probability of each substation under the
   persistent virus-based intrusion. Assuming a virus may trip all breakers
   in the infected substation, the cyber-security risk is evaluated to
   identify system-level vulnerabilities. The IEEE 118-bus system with a
   layered cyber network is used for case studies. Test results validate
   the proposed model and provide further insights into the virus-based
   intrusion.},

Abstract = {Role based access control reduces the cost of security administration of
   large-scale systems. However, it mainly abstracts a user from the

   control is based on not only the function attribute, but domain and

   attributes of a user need to adapt to state changes. We present a

Abstract = {Cybersecurity is no longer an issue discussed only between the
   professionals or technologists, but it is also closely related to
   ordinary people whose daily life is exposed to kinds of cyberattacks.
   And Womabat Security Technologies conducted a survey revealed that
   ransomware is an unknown concept to nearly two-thirds of employees. In
   practical, almost 95\% of cybersecurity attacks are due to human error.
   At fact, expensive and sophisticated systems cannot work effectively
   without considering the human factor, while human factor is the major
   vulnerability in cybersecurity. Thus, it has great significance to give
   people cybersecurity awareness training. In this paper, we present a
   system, named ASURA, providing adaptive training aimed at improving
   cybersecurity awareness of people. Three issues can't be neglected in
   adaptive cybersecurity awareness training, as follows. Firstly, we need
   to decide the proper training contents from the huge training materials.
   Secondly, the training contents should be timely updated, as cyber
   attacks constantly changing. At last, we should conduct training through
   effective and acceptable approach. We solved above three issues in this
   paper, and the innovative idea of this paper is constructing
   hierarchical concept map from the LOD database DBpedia. Then, we employ
   a series of processing on hierarchical concept map, including PageRank
   algorithm used to calculate the importance of each concept node, and
   filtering used to filtered out undefined and unrelated concepts. In
   particular, we get training contents from DBpedia dynamically and timely
   updated, so that training contents is keeping up to date. ASURA
   delivered training contents completely online, thus significant trimmed
   budget and allowed learners accessing training outside of a traditional
   classroom. Moreover, ASURA provide adaptive training targeted to
   individual learner, as it generate training contents based on the
   keyword from the learner.},

Abstract = {Security assessment has been related to contingencies produced by
   internal causes, such as operating failures or external, such as
   short-circuit caused by incidental atmospheric conditions in system
   components. However, terrorism actions could be considered as the
   largest threat to the power infrastructure in some countries.
   The robustness and security of a power system has to be related to the
   ability of the system to support contingencies due to terrorism actions.
   Therefore, methods and techniques should be developed with the main aim
   of improving power system security against terrorism.
   To collaborate to this effort this paper proposes an extension of a well
   known classification of events and operating states. A classification
   that includes, internal and external natural and unnatural or man caused
   events is important for proposing new security analysis methods that
   consider event uncertainties. Natural events are mainly random while
   unnatural event uncertainty are ambiguous, vague or confuse and some
   kind of expert elicitation should be applied. In Colombia during year
   2002 about 500 towers were destroyed by terrorists. These kinds of
   events are the main cause of security problems in the power system.},

Abstract = {This paper describes work in our project funded by DARPA Dynamic
   Coalitions program to design, develop, and demonstrate a system for
   automatically managing security policies in dynamic networks..
   Specifically, we aim to reduce human involvement in network management
   by building a practical network reconfiguration system so that simple
   security policies stated as positive and negative invariants are upheld
   as the network changes. The focus of this project is a practical tool to
   help systems administrators verifiably enforce simple multi-layer
   network security policies. Our key design considerations are
   computational cost of policy validation and the power of the enforcement
   primitives. The central component is a policy engine populated by models
   of network elements and services that validates policies and computes
   new configuration settings for network elements when they are violated
   We instantiate our policy enforcement tool using a monitoring and
   instrumentation layer that reports network changes as they occur and
   implements configuration changes computed by the policy engine.},

Abstract = {The Fiat-Shamir transformation is the most efficient construction of
   non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs.
   This paper is concerned with two variants of the transformation that
   appear but have not been clearly delineated in existing literature. Both
   variants start with the prover making a commitment. The strong variant
   then hashes both the commitment and the statement to be proved, whereas
   the weak variant hashes only the commitment. This minor change yields
   dramatically different security guarantees: in situations where
   malicious provers can select their statements adaptively, the weak
   Fiat-Shamir transformation yields unsound/ unextractable proofs. Yet
   such settings naturally occur in systems when zero-knowledge proofs are
   used to enforce honest behavior. We illustrate this point by showing
   that the use of the weak Fiat-Shamir transformation in the Helios
   cryptographic voting system leads to several possible security breaches:
   for some standard types of elections, under plausible circumstances,
   malicious parties can cause the tallying procedure to run indefinitely
   and even tamper with the result of the election.
   On the positive side, we define a form of adaptive security for
   zero-knowledge proofs in the random oracle model ( essentially
   simulation-sound extractability), and show that a variant which we call
   strong Fiat-Shamir yields secure non-interactive proofs.
   This level of security was assumed in previous works on Helios and our
   results are then necessary for these analyses to be valid. Additionally,
   we show that strong proofs in Helios achieve non-malleable encryption
   and satisfy ballot privacy, improving on previous results that required
   CCA security.},

Abstract = {Intrusion detection and response research has so far mostly concentrated
   on known and well-defined attacks. We believe that this narrow focus of
   attacks accounts for both the successes and limitation of commercial
   intrusion detection systems (IDS). Intrusion tolerance, on the other
   hand, is inherently tied to functions and services that require
   protection. This paper presents a state transition model to describe the
   dynamic behavior of intrusion tolerant systems. This model provides a
   framework from which we can define the vulnerability, and the threat set
   to be addressed. We also show how this model helps us to describe both
   known and unknown security exploits by focusing on impacts rather than
   specific attack procedures. By going through the exercise of mapping
   known vulnerabilities to this transition model, we identify, a
   reasonably complete fault space that should be considered in a general
   intrusion tolerant system.},

   Assumption in prime-order groups (as opposed to q-type assumptions or

   improvements come at the cost of a larger public key. Finally, we show
   that our scheme achieves adaptive security in the multi-ciphertext
   setting with a security loss that is independent of the number of

Abstract = {Relationship-based access control (ReBAC) policies can express intricate
   protection requirements in terms of relationships among users and
   resources (which can be modeled as a graph). Such policies are useful in
   domains beyond online social networks. However, given the updating graph
   of user and resources in a system and expressive conditions in access
   control policy rules, it can be very challenging for security
   administrators to envision what can (or cannot) happen as the protection
   system evolves.
   In this paper, we introduce the security analysis problem for this class
   of policies, where we seek to answer security queries about future
   states of the system graph and authorizations that are decided
   accordingly. Towards achieving this goal, we propose a state-transition
   model of a ReBAC protection system, called RePM. We discuss about
   formulation of security analysis queries in RePM and present our initial
   results for a limited version of this model.},

Abstract = {The oil or gas station is an important producing unit, building a
   perimeter security system is an available method for protecting the
   stations and improving the capacity of dealing with the emergency

   stations are the main protecting methods, it is difficult to detect
   invasion immediately. So, it is necessary to construct a stable and
   reliable perimeter security system to protect the station. Traditional
   fiber perimeter security technology protects the station by sensing
   fiber on the fence or wall, but the wind will produce many false alarms.
   In this paper, a multi-mode sensing cable buried in the ground, systems
   can not only effectively detect intrusions, but more importantly, avoid
   false alarms by wind disturbance. Intrusions will produce non-stationary
   random signals, through the signal processing and recognizing technique,
   we can identify the invasion and improve the accuracy and stability of
   the system.},

Title = {Adaptively secure non-interactive threshold cryptosystems},
Journal = {THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {478},
Pages = {76-100},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Threshold cryptography aims at enhancing the availability and security
   of decryption and signature schemes by splitting private keys into
   several (say n) shares (typically, each of size comparable to the
   original secret key). In these schemes, a quorum of at least (d <= n)
   servers needs to act upon a message to produce the result (decrypted
   value or signature), while corrupting less than d servers maintains the
   scheme's security. For about two decades, extensive study was dedicated
   to this subject, which created a number of notable results. So far, most
   practical threshold signatures, where servers act non-interactively,
   were analyzed in the limited static corruption model (where the
   adversary chooses which servers will be corrupted at the system's
   initialization stage). Existing threshold encryption schemes that
   withstand the strongest combination of adaptive malicious corruptions
   (allowing the adversary to corrupt servers at any time based on its
   complete view), and chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA) all require
   interaction (in the non-idealized model) and attempts to remedy this
   problem resulted only in relaxed schemes. The same is true for threshold
   signatures secure under chosen-message attacks (CMA). To date (for about
   10 years), it has been open whether there are non-interactive threshold
   schemes providing the highest security (namely, CCA-secure encryption
   and CMA-secure signature) with scalable shares (i.e., as short as the
   original key) and adaptive security. This paper answers this question
   affirmatively by presenting such efficient decryption and signature
   schemes within a unified algebraic framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {A Dynamic Programming Model for Internal Attack Detection in Wireless
   Sensor Networks},
Journal = {DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2017},
Abstract = {Internal attack is a crucial security problem of WSN (wireless sensor
   network). In this paper, we focus on the internal attack detection which
   is an important way to locate attacks. We propose a state transition
   model, based on the continuous time Markov chain (CTMC), to study the
   behaviors of the sensors in a WSN under internal attack. Then we conduct
   the internal attack detection model as the epidemiological model. In
   this model, we explore the detection rate as the rate of a compromised
   state transition to a response state. By using the Bellman equation, the
   utility for the state transitions of a sensor can be written in standard
   forms of dynamic programming. It reveals a natural way to find the
   optimal detection rate that is by maximizing the total utility of the
   compromised state of the node (the sum of current utility and future
   utility). In particular, we encapsulate the current state,
   survivability, availability, and energy consumption of the WSN into an
   information set. We conduct extensive experiments and the results show
   the effectiveness of our solutions.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an optimal allocation method for flexible ac
   transmission system (FACTS) devices for market-based power systems
   considering congestion relief and voltage stability. The purpose of the
   FACTS devices installation is to provide benefit for all entities
   accomplished by both minimizing annual device investment cost and
   maximizing annual benefit defined as difference between expected
   security cost (ESC) with and without FACTS devices installation.
   Different from previous approaches, the proposed method accurately
   evaluates the annual cost and benefits obtainable by FACTS devices
   installation by formulating a large-scale optimization problem that
   contains power flow analyses for a large number of system states
   representing annual power system operations. In addition, dynamic state
   transitions caused by specified contingencies are also simulated in the
   optimization problem to evaluate the effect of FACTS control actions as
   well as the other coordinated controls. The expected cost consists of
   operating cost under normal and contingency states along with their
   related probabilities to occur. Maximizing social welfare is the
   objective for normal state while minimizing compensations for
   generations re-scheduling and load shedding as well as maximizing social
   welfare are the objectives in case of contingency. Although installation
   cost of FACTS devices is required, they are useful as cost free means,
   which can reduce effectively the annual costs for generations
   re-scheduling and load shedding.},

   assessment, total transfer capacity evaluation, preventive and
   corrective control schemes etc. are developed in this system. To
   estimate the forthcoming state's security level, all these modules also
   run in the forecasted 15-minutes ahead operating state. And some key
   technologies, such as PEBS based contingency screen and distributed
   computing technology, are used to improve the efficiency of the system
   to accommodate real-time application. Enhanced total transfer capacity
   calculating (TTC) method are developed which can both calculate
   pessimistic value and optimistic value of TTC in the same time. The
   preventive control algorithm is developed which is based on transient
   energy function sensitivity. Some engineering-oriented methods are also
   introduced which are used to solve practical problems emerged in real
   application. In the last part of the paper, some data from a real system

Abstract = {This paper presents the first adaptively simulation secure functional
   encryption (FE) schemes for attribute-weighted sums. In such an FE
   scheme, encryption takes as input N pairs of attribute \{(xi, zi)\} (i
   is an element of{[}N]) for some N is an element of N where the
   attributes \{xi\} (i is an element of{[}N]) are public while the
   attributes \{zi\} (i is an element of{[}N]) are private. The indices i
   is an element of {[}N] are referred to as the slots. A secret key
   corresponds to some weight function f, and decryption recovers the
   weighted sum Sigma(N)(i=1) f(x(i))z(i). This is an important
   functionality with a wide range of potential real life applications. In
   the proposed FE schemes attributes are viewed as vectors and weight
   functions are arithmetic branching programs (ABP). We present two
   schemes with varying parameters and levels of adaptive security. (a) We
   first present a one-slot scheme that achieves adaptive security in the
   simulation-based security model against a bounded number of ciphertext
   queries and an arbitrary polynomial number of secret key queries both
   before and after the ciphertext queries. This is the best possible level
   of security one can achieve in the adaptive simulationbased framework.
   From the relations between the simulation-based and
   indistinguishability-based security frameworks for FE, it follows that
   the proposed FE scheme also achieves indistinguishabilitybased adaptive
   security against an a-priori unbounded number of ciphertext queries and
   an arbitrary polynomial number of secret key queries both before and
   after the ciphertext queries. Moreover, the scheme enjoys compact
   ciphertexts that do not grow with the number of appearances of the
   attributes within the weight functions. (b) Next, bootstrapping from the
   one-slot scheme, we present an unbounded-slot scheme that achieves
   simulation-based adaptive security against a bounded number of
   ciphertext and pre-ciphertext secret key queries while supporting an
   a-priori unbounded number of post-ciphertext secret key queries. The
   scheme achieves public parameters and secret key sizes independent of
   the number of slots N and a secret key can decrypt a ciphertext for any
   a-priori unbounded N. Further, just like the one-slot scheme, this
   scheme also has the ciphertext size independent of the number of
   appearances of the attributes within the weight functions. However, all
   the parameters of the scheme, namely, the master public key,
   ciphertexts, and secret keys scale linearly with the bound on the number
   of pre-ciphertext Our schemes are built upon asymmetric bilinear groups
   of prime order and the security is derived under the standard
   (bilateral) k-Linear (k-Lin) assumption. Our work resolves an open
   problem posed by Abdalla, Gong, and Wee in CRYPTO 2020, where they
   presented an unbounded-slot FE scheme for attribute-weighted sum
   achieving only semi-adaptive simulation security. At a technical level,
   our work extends the recent adaptive security framework of Lin and Luo
   {[}EUROCRYPT 2020], devised to achieve compact ciphertexts in the
   context of indistinguishability-based payload-hiding security, into the
   setting of simulation-based adaptive attribute-hiding security. Our
   schemes are built upon asymmetric bilinear groups of prime order and the
   security is derived under the standard (bilateral) k-Linear (k-Lin)
   assumption. Our work resolves an open problem posed by Abdalla, Gong,
   and Wee in CRYPTO 2020, where they presented an unbounded-slot FE scheme
   for attribute-weighted sum achieving only semi-adaptive simulation

Abstract = {As a new security defense theory, Cyberspace mimic defense (CMD)
   provides an architecture named Dynamic heterogeneous redundancy (DHR) to
   enhance the defense level of system security. Due to the new dynamic
   defense mechanism DHR introduced in CMD systems, traditional security
   modelling and analysis methods can hardly be used for them. In this
   paper, we propose a Security ontology-based modelling method for CMD
   systems (SOCMD), which uses ontology to represent DHR components and to
   define their inner relationships. SOCMD also connects information
   components including DHRs with security vulnerabilities, threats and
   attackers in cyberspace. Next, attacking rules, multi-mode arbitration
   mechanism and combination rules are designed with SOCMD for CMD systems
   and a new logical-checking method is proposed to make judgement about
   the security state of SOCMD. Finally, different use cases and
   performance tests are developed to demonstrate the application process
   for the model and to verify the validity of our method.},

Abstract = {For the purpose of improving comprehensive performance including
   stability, security and economic benefit of power system, in this study
   a two-level hierarchical hybrid control is proposed in a real-time
   manner. First, a novel hybrid model is founded to clearly explain the
   hybrid dynamical behaviors of the power systems. On the basis of the
   model, a hybrid control scheme is designed in an interaction manner
   between the discrete control strategies at the upper level and the
   continuous dynamical controls at the lower level. The upper level
   discrete control strategies are responsible for converting operating
   modes to guarantee the security during significant disturbances and the
   economic benefit of overall system. After locating operating modes, the
   lower level local continuous controllers are responsible for regulating
   dynamic behavior of each controlled unit to obtain the satisfactory
   stability performance. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid control
   is demonstrated through simulation examples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {In a typical supply chain network, a purchaser is a manufacturer or a
   retail distributor. In order to keep the cost down, a purchaser tends to
   send out the request for quotation for a group of potential suppliers.
   The purchaser will choose a supplier with the best combination of price
   and quality. Sometimes a potential supplier will try to collect the
   information about other suppliers so he/she can provide the best bid to
   the purchaser. Since most transactions am done through a computer.
   network system such as Extranet or Internet, the confidentiality becomes
   very important between suppliers and the purchaser.
   The Bell-LaPadula model is one of security models for information
   confidentiality and has been adopted by military for a long time. Chen
   et. al. has proposed the application of Bell-Lapadula model in the
   design of supply chain network. In the Bell-Lapadula model a subject can
   be in one of different security clearance and an object can be in one of
   various security classifications. This paper attempts to model the
   security on the supply chain networks using Markov chain by combining
   subjects and objects as its states to simulate the security state
   transitions.},

Title = {Discovering and utilising expert knowledge from security event logs},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {48},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Vulnerability assessment and security configuration of computer systems
   is heavily dependent on human experts, which are widely attributed as
   being in short supply. This can result in a system being left insecure
   because of the lack of easily accessible experience and specialist
   resources. While performing security tasks, human experts often revert
   to a system's event logs to establish security information
   (configuration changes, errors, etc.). However, finding and exploiting
   knowledge from event logs is a challenging and time-consuming task for
   non-experts. Hence there is a strong need to provide mechanisms to make
   the process easier for security experts, as well as providing tools for
   those with significantly less security expertise. In this paper, we
   present a novel technique to process security event logs of a system
   that have been evaluated and configured by a security expert, extract
   key domain knowledge indicative of human decision making, and
   automatically apply acquired knowledge to previously unseen systems by
   non-experts to propose security improvements.
   The proposed solution utilises rule mining algorithms to extract
   security actions from event log entries. The set of identified rules is
   represented as a domain action model. The domain model and problem
   instance generated from a previously unseen system can then be used to
   produce a plan-of-action, which can be exploited by non-professionals to
   improve their system's security. Empirical analysis is subsequently
   performed on 21 event logs, where the acquired domain model and
   identified plans are discussed in terms of accuracy and performance. (C)

Abstract = {Software-defined networking (SDN) allows the smart grid to be centrally
   controlled and managed by decoupling the control plane from the data
   plane, but it also expands attack surface for attackers. Existing
   studies about the security of SDN-enabled smart grid (SDSG) mainly
   focused on static methods such as access control and identity
   authentication, which is vulnerable to attackers that carefully probe
   the system. As the attacks become more variable and complex, there is an
   urgent need for dynamic defense methods. In this paper, we propose a
   security function virtualization (SFV) based moving target defense of
   SDSG which makes the attack surface constantly changing. First, we
   design a dynamic defense mechanism by migrating virtual security
   function (VSF) instances as the traffic state changes. The centralized
   SDN controller is re-designed for global status monitoring and migration
   management. Moreover, we formalize the VSF instances migration problem
   as an integer nonlinear programming problem with multiple constraints
   and design a pre-migration algorithm to prevent VSF instances' resources
   from being exhausted. Simulation results indicate the feasibility of the
   proposed scheme.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a vital component of many future
   industries. By intelligent integration of sensors, wireless
   communications, computing techniques, and data analytics, IoT can
   increase productivity and efficiency of industries. Reliability of data
   transmission is key to realize several applications offered by IoT. In
   this paper, we present an overview of future IoT applications, and their
   major communication requirements. We provide a brief survey of recent
   work in four major areas of reliable IoT including resource allocation,
   latency management, security, and reliability metrics. Finally, we
   highlight some of the important challenges for reliable IoT related to
   machine learning techniques, 6G communications and blockchain based
   security that need further investigation and discuss related future
   directions.},

Abstract = {Almost 50 years ago, D. E. Bell and L. LaPadula published the first
   formal model of a secure system, known today as the Bell-LaPadula (BLP)
   model. BLP is described as a state machine by means of first-order logic
   and set theory. The authors also formalize two state invariants known as
   security condition and {*}-property. Bell and LaPadula prove that all
   the state transitions preserve these invariants. In this paper we
   present a fully automated proof of the security condition and the
   {*}-property for all the model operations. The model and the proofs are
   coded in the \{log\} tool. As far as we know this is the first time such
   proofs are automated. Besides, we show that the \{log\} model is also an
   executable prototype. Therefore we are providing an automatically
   verified executable prototype of BLP.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a formulation for VAR planning method for
   guaranteeing secure power system operation in competitive environments.
   The formulation is useful for the evaluation of reactive power value,
   for effective investment of slow and fast VAR devices, for the
   examination of pricing and procurement of VARs through market. Since
   load shedding is the last resort for keeping security, the annual
   expectation of the load shedding cost is used as a security index to
   evaluate the overall benefits of VAR resources which respond in dynamic
   state transitions in contingencies. The proposed formulation takes into
   account the multiple benefits of reactive power in a single problem,
   which may be useful to evaluate the real value of the VARs. It is
   demonstrated that the maximum cost saving is achieved by a balanced
   installation of SC and SVC with keeping a specified security level. A
   VAR procurement method through market is also investigated using the
   formulation.},

Title = {Towards Further Formal Foundation of Web Security: Expression of
   Temporal Logic in Alloy and Its Application to a Security Model With
   Cache},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {74941-74960},
Abstract = {Security analysis of a web system is complicated, and thus analysis
   using formal methods to describe system specification mathematically has
   attracted attention. Some previous studies have adopted formal methods,
   but their models cannot express parallel communication completely. This
   limitation gives rise to problems where web functions, such as a cache
   that stores contents, cannot be defined and attacks that forge contents
   cannot be analyzed. These problems are present in the Alloy-based
   implementations of current models that do not have the ability to
   express temporal logic. Therefore, we design implementation and
   evaluation of temporal logic in Alloy to express time series and
   parallel computation for web security analysis. In doing so, state
   transitions in the web can be expressed by fitting them in our proposed
   syntax. As concrete applications, we describe a web security model that
   includes caches and show that our proposed syntax can analyze
   state-of-the-art attacks, such as unauthorized access to users' account
   pages via caches. The source code of our proposed model in Alloy is
   publicly available.},

Title = {Tag-based ABE in prime-order groups via pair encoding},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {89},

Abstract = {Predicate/pair encodings are simple frameworks for designing
   attribute-based encryption (ABE) for complex predicates, with pair
   encodings being able to handle more complex predicates. Thus far,
   several generic constructions of prime-order ABE schemes have been
   proposed with these encodings. Chen, Gay, and Wee (CGW) (Eurocrypt' 15)
   and Chen and Gong (CG) (Asiacrypt' 17) proposed generic constructions
   with predicate encodings with a trade-off in efficiency. In particular,
   the former construction (CGW ABE) has the shorter secret keys, whereas
   the latter construction (CG ABE) has the shorter master public keys and
   ciphertexts. Moreover, CG ABE requires three pairing operations during
   decryption, while CGW ABE requires four. Agrawal and Chase (AC) (TCC'
   16) proposed a generic construction with pair encodings that is an
   extension of CGW ABE and can handle more complex predicates.
   Specifically, if pair encoding schemes satisfy perfect security (resp.
   relaxed perfect security), then AC ABE satisfies full security (resp.
   semi-adaptive security) from the standard k-linear assumption. However,
   there is no extension of CG ABE with pair encodings. In this paper, we
   construct this extension. As with the trade-off between CGW ABE and CG
   ABE, our proposed ABE has shorter master public keys and ciphertexts and
   larger secret keys, requires less pairing operations during decryption
   than AC ABE. Furthermore, as with AC ABE, our proposed ABE satisfies
   full security (resp. semi-adaptive security) if pair encoding schemes
   satisfy perfect security (resp. relaxed perfect security) from the
   standard k-linear assumption. As an application, we propose a
   ciphertext-policy ABE scheme for non-monotone span programs with compact
   ciphertexts satisfying semi-adaptive security.},

Abstract = {We propose a new generic framework for constructing fully secure
   attribute based encryption (ABE) in multilinear settings. It is
   applicable in a generic manner to any predicates. Previous generic
   frameworks of this kind are given only in bilinear group settings, where
   applicable predicate classes are limited. Our framework provides an
   abstraction of dual system paradigms over composite-order graded
   multilinear encoding schemes in a black-box manner.
   As applications, we propose new fully secure ABE systems for general
   predicates, namely, ABE for circuits. We obtain two schemes for each of
   key-policy (KP) and ciphertext-policy (CP) variants of ABE. All of our
   four fully secure schemes can deal with unbounded-size circuits, while
   enjoy succinctness, meaning that the key and ciphertext sizes are (less
   than or) proportional to corresponding circuit sizes. In the CP-ABE
   case, no scheme ever achieves such properties, even when considering
   selectively secure systems. Furthermore, our second KP-ABE achieves
   constant-size ciphertexts, whereas our second CP-ABE achieves
   constant-size keys. Previous ABE systems for circuits are either
   selectively secure (Gorbunov et al. STOC'13, Garg et al. Crypto'13, and
   subsequent works), or semi-adaptively secure (Brakerski and
   Vaikuntanathan Crypto' 16), or fully-secure but not succinct and
   restricted to bounded-size circuits (Garg et al. ePrint 2014/622, and
   Garg et al. TCC' 16-A).},

Abstract = {Multi-modal biometric verification systems are in active development and
   show impressive performance nowadays. However, such systems need
   additional protection from spoofing attacks. In our paper we present
   full pipeline of anti-spoofing method (based on our previous work) for
   bimodal audiovisual verification system. This method allows to evaluate
   parameters of quality for a sequence of face images during a
   verification process. Based on this parameters it's decided whether the
   data is suitable for processing by the standard method (fiducial points
   based audiovisual liveness detection, FALD). If the quality of data is
   not sufficient, then our system switches to a new algorithm (svm-based
   audiovisual liveness detection, SALD), which provides less protection
   quality, but is able to operate when FALD is unsuitable. To improve the
   quality of the FALD algorithm we have collected the special dataset.
   This dataset allows to get better reliability of the algorithm for
   searching of fiducial points on the user's face image. Tests show that
   developed system can significantly improve the quality of anti-spoofing
   protection versus our previous work.},

Abstract = {One way to show that a system is not secure is to demonstrate that a
   malicious or mistake-prone user or program can break security by causing
   the system to reach a nonsecure state. A fundamental aspect of a
   security model is a proof that validates that every state reachable from
   a secure initial state is secure. A sequential security model assumes
   that every command that acts as a state transition executes
   sequentially, while a concurrent security model assumes that multiple
   commands execute concurrently. This paper presents a security model
   called the Centralized-Parallel-Distributed model (CPD model) that
   defines security for logically, or physically centralized, parallel, and
   distributed systems. The purpose of the CPD model is to define

Abstract = {With the rapid development of technology and the proliferation of
   uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), there is an immediate need for security
   solutions. Toward this end, we propose the use of a multi-robot system
   for autonomous and cooperative counter-UAS missions. In this paper, we
   present the design of the hardware and software components of different
   complementary robotic platforms: a mobile uncrewed ground vehicle (UGV)
   equipped with a LiDAR sensor, an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) with a
   gimbal-mounted stereo camera for air-to-air inspections, and a UAV with
   a capture mechanism equipped with radars and camera. Our proposed system
   features 1) scalability to larger areas due to the distributed approach
   and online processing, 2) long-term cooperative missions, and 3)
   complementary multimodal perception for the detection of multirotor
   UAVs. In field experiments, we demonstrate the integration of all
   subsystems in accomplishing a counter-UAS task within an unstructured
   environment. The obtained results confirm the promising direction of
   using multirobot and multi-modal systems for C-UAS.},

   Specifically, our scheme is built from composite order multilinear maps
   and enjoys ciphertext overhead of a constant number of group elements
   which are O(1) bits. Furthermore, the private key size and public key
   size are all poly-logarithmic in the total number of users. Herein, we
   generalize the methodology of Lewko and Waters for realizing dual system
   encryption to the composite order multilinear groups, and then prove the
   adaptive security of our scheme under static assumptions in the standard
   model. Compared with the state-of-the-art, our scheme achieves the
   adaptive security in simple and non-interactive falsifiable assumptions
   with the optimized parameter size for BE.},

Abstract = {The System Management Mode (SMM) is a highly privileged processor
   operating mode in x86 platforms. The goal of the SMM is to perform
   system management functions, such as hardware control and power
   management. Because of this, SMM has powerful resources. Moreover, its
   executive software executes unnoticed by any other component in the
   system, including operating systems and hypervisors. For that reason,
   SMM has been exploited in the past to facilitate attacks, misuse, or
   alternatively, building security tools capitalising on its resources. In
   this paper, we discuss how the use of the SMM has been contributing to
   the arms race between system's attackers and defenders. We analyse the
   main work published on attacks, misuse and implementing security tools
   in the SMM and how the SMM has been modified to respond to those issues.
   Finally, we discuss how Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX)
   technology, a sort of ``hypervisor in processor{''}, presents a possible
   answer to the issue of using SMM for security purposes.},

Abstract = {A scientific discipline which includes methods that enable

   Enhancement of security and the increase in its demand has paved way to
   an interest in an automated method of personal authentication which is
   based on Biometrics in recent times. Owing to the availability of
   multiple factors of evidence biometric systems that are multi-modal are
   considered to be more reliable. In visual interactions among humans,
   facial recognition is one of the most commonly acceptable biometrics.
   Selection of features is a challenging task as the interaction among the
   facial features can be complex. Therefore, Particle Swarm Optimization
   (PSO) which is a feature selection based on algorithm has been proposed
   as suitable for the multi-modal biometric system which in turn can bring
   down significantly the dimension by making use of different fusion
   schemes and identifying optimal features from among them.},

Abstract = {Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is a self-configuring network depending
   upon infrastructure, also is a significant technology which supplies
   virtual hardware and software resources as per requirement of mobile ad
   hoc network. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been established
   to protect Cross Interior (routing) at source to goal from different
   types of attack. Current IDS approaches can be classified as either
   anomaly or signature-based methods such as Rule-based expert systems,
   State transition analysis, Bayesian alarm networks aspects are various
   challenges with respect to the efficiency as well as performance. The
   major challenge is the compromise of performance because of unavailable
   resources with respect to the MANET. To increase the MANET environment's
   performance, various techniques are employed for routing, security
   purpose. An efficient security module requires a routing in terms of
   packet loss. The Integrated Cross Interior (ICI) structure for Intrusion
   Detection System (IDS) namely ICIs for IDS are proposed for exactness of
   black hole attacks detection. The ICIs for IDS performs the task of
   routing of the mobile nodes. The proposed (ICIs for IDS) produces the
   enhancement of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) with routing algorithm
   named as Integrated Cross Interior algorithm that performs maps the
   security with the secure IDS communication and distributes the packets
   among different destination, based on priority. This paper proposes a
   novel Integrated Cross Interior structure for Intrusion Detection System
   (ICIS for IDS) to secure our network from black hole attacks. This
   algorithm is proposed for node routing and node security by considering
   maximum throughput 83.5\% with minimum routing cost, response time with
   6.3ms. The experimental results specify that ICIs for IDS based security
   policy effectively minimizes the response time as well as the mobile
   routing cost, response time of an application with respect to other
   existing approaches such as IDS with AODV. The proposed algorithm is
   experimented using Network Simulator-2 and the results demonstrated that
   the performance of the algorithm is better than other conventional
   algorithms like IDS with AODV. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Implementing REST API for SDN is quite challenging compared to
   conventional web services. First, the state transfers in SDN are more
   complex among network devices, controllers, and applications. Second,
   SDN provides more granular resources in both the controller and the
   network device itself. Those challenges require SDN to have a proper
   REST API security definition, which is currently not available in most
   of the SDN controllers. In this paper, we propose and implement a REST
   API security module for SDN controller based on OAuth 2.0. We answer the
   SDN REST API security challenges by presenting novel access control
   parameters to cope with the granular resources introduced by SDN. Our
   prototype maintains the best trade-off between performance and safety by
   generating a maximum value of 15\% overhead during our benchmark. It
   also offers a customizable and flexible access control for the network
   in various use cases.},

Title = {Impact analysis of cyber system in microgrids: Perspective from economy
   and reliability},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {135},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {With the increasing requirements of power supply quality and operation
   economy of the microgrid in smart grid field, real-time energy
   scheduling methods that highly rely on the cyber system are inevitable
   supports for the optimal operation of microgrids. As a typical
   cyber-physical system, the disturbance and failure on the cyber side may
   make the performance of microgrids deviate from the expected ones. To
   quantify the degree to which these cyber contingencies influence the
   microgrid system, we propose a novel quantification and analytical
   framework. In this framework, the cyber system of a centrally controlled
   microgrid is abstracted consisting of information conversion,
   transmission and routing forward, as well as fusion and calculation. On
   this basis, the general in-formation flow is modeled through information
   mapping between measured state and control command. Furthermore, an
   equivalent model for a cyber-physical microgrid system is formulated by
   integrating informa-tion mapping model into the state transition of
   physical microgrid. With this equivalent model, a unified impact
   analytical procedure is presented to accurately quantify the physical
   impact of multi-cyber-contingencies in both economy and reliability
   aspects. Numerical simulations on a microgrid validate the
   reasonableness and effec-tiveness of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {The recent Meltdown and Spectre attacks took the community by surprise.
   Rather than exploiting an incorrect implementation of the ISA, these
   attacks leverage the undocumented implementationspecific speculation
   behavior of high-performance microarchitectures to affect the
   extra-architectural state of the machine (e. g., caches).
   Inspired by these novel speculation-based attacks, we argue it is time
   to rethink the traditional ISA layers. Programmers and security
   professionals need a framework to reason about the effects of
   speculation and other microarchitectural performance optimizations. We
   propose judiciously extending the ISA to include the extraarchitectural
   state so that an ISA implementation either completely squashes all
   system state changes caused by mis-speculated instructions or the
   potential changes are rigorously documented. We hope this new framework
   will give architects and security researchers tools to reduce the
   likelihood of future surprise vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {The smart power grid enables intelligent automation at all levels of
   power system operation, from electricity generation at power plants to
   power usage in the home. The key enabling factor of an efficient smart
   grid is its built-in ICT, which monitors the real-time system operating
   state and makes control decisions accordingly. As an important building
   block of the ICT system, power system state estimation is of critical
   importance to maintain normal operation of the smart grid, which,
   however, is under mounting threat from potential cyber attacks. In this
   article, we introduce a graph-based framework for performing
   cyber-security analysis in power system state estimation. Compared to
   conventional arithmetic-based security analysis, the graphical
   characterization of state estimation security provides intuitive
   visualization of some complex problem structures and enables efficient
   graphical solution algorithms, which are useful for both defending and
   attacking the ICT system of the smart grid. We also highlight several
   promising future research directions on graph-based security analysis
   and its applications in smart power grid.},

Abstract = {In recent years the wide spread introduction of small embedded systems
   into every corner of everyday life lead to the strong need for highly
   reliable and secure computing machines. These machines now affect the
   safety of humans as well as the security of personal data and
   consequently money transactions. To ensure the integrity of these
   systems' operating state, several fault detection mechanisms have been
   developed to safely correct or stop unforeseen execution behavior.
   Because of the rise of battery or even field-supplied systems these
   mechanisms often heavily decrease available power budgets or lead to
   significantly increased production costs.
   Therefore, this paper introduces novel micro-architectural execution
   signature characterization and handling techniques for system-on-chip
   designs providing power estimation hardware. Existing power sensor
   infrastructure is reused to enable efficient system-state monitoring
   using micro-architectural hashes to cover a wide range of implemented
   system functionality. Reduced hashing implementations are characterized
   for their fault detection efficiency. This hardware-based approach
   provides a completely transparent solution to counteract faults
   resulting from emerging wear-out defects or intentional attacks on the
   execution integrity.},

   considering ramping capabilities and multi-states of gas and thermal

   into account for spinning reserves scheduling together with thermal

   established, and embedded in proposed energy storage optimal

Abstract = {One of the chief computer security problems is not the long list of
   viruses and other potential vulnerabilities, but the vast number of
   systems that continue to be easy prey, as their system administrators or
   owners simply aren't able to keep up with all of the available patches,
   updates, or needed configuration changes in order to protect them from
   those known vulnerabilities. Even up-to-date systems could become
   vulnerable to attacks, due to inappropriate configuration or combined
   used of applications and services.
   Our mobile agent-based security tool (MAST) is designed to bridge this
   gap, and provide automated methods to make sure that all of the systems
   in a specific domain or network are secured and up-to-date with all
   patches and updates. The tool is also designed to check systems for
   misconfigurations that make them vulnerable. Additionally, this user
   interface is presented in a domain knowledge model known as a Concept
   Map that provides a continuous teaming experience for the system
   administrator.},

Abstract = {Significant emphasis has been placed recently on the hardening of
   databases and on regular audits of such systems by independent auditors
   and certified Information Systems Security Officers (ISSO). Data centers
   hosting sensitive data and mission -critical systems, especially centers
   that belong to governmental agencies, have been under tremendous
   pressure to secure their databases in compliance with several security
   guidelines. Such requirements mandate that each system passes a strict
   security scan before it is deemed suitable to go into operational mode
   and that it be subjected to regular audits thereafter This in turn has
   been putting tremendous pressure on database administrators who, in many
   cases, are already overwhelmed by the tasks of installing, properly
   maintaining, and configuring their systems in a way that provides
   optimal performance. However, it is becoming extremely challenging, time
   consuming, and resource intensive to address security demands under
   tight budgets and timelines. Therefore, it would be advantageous to
   implement autonomic features into database systems to address some
   aspects of this challenge. This paper presents a framework that embeds
   autonomic capabilities into database systems to provide self-protection
   features in case of unauthorized, inadvertent, or intentional change in
   security parameters. This is achieved by embedding into the database the
   capability to compare each security configuration parameter change
   attempt (or request) with an embedded predefined security policy before
   allowing or rejecting the change. The paper demonstrates how the
   proposed framework can be implemented in an Oracle 10g Release 2
   database.},

Abstract = {The development of the digital transformation in the organizations has
   become more expanding in these present and future years. This is because
   of the active demand to use the ICT services among all the organizations
   whether in the government agencies or private sectors. While digital
   transformation has led manufacturers to incorporate sensors and software
   analytics into their offerings, the same innovation has also brought
   pressure to offer clients more accommodating appliance deployment
   options. So, their needs a well plan to implement the cyber
   infrastructures and equipment. The cyber security play important role to
   ensure that the ICT components or infrastructures execute well along the
   organization's business successful. This paper will present a study of
   security management models to guideline the security maintenance on
   existing cyber infrastructures. In order to perform security model for
   the currently existing cyber infrastructures, combination of the some
   security workforces and security process of extracting the security
   maintenance in cyber infrastructures. In the assessment, the focused on
   the cyber security maintenance within security models in cyber
   infrastructures and presented a way for the theoretical and practical
   analysis based on the selected security management models. Then, the
   proposed model does evaluation for the analysis which can be used to
   obtain insights into the configuration and to specify desired and
   undesired configurations. The implemented cyber security maintenance
   within security management model in a prototype and evaluated it for
   practical and theoretical scenarios. Furthermore, a framework model is
   presented which allows the evaluation of configuration changes in the
   agile and dynamic cyber infrastructure environments with regard to
   properties like vulnerabilities or expected availability. In case of a
   security perspective, this evaluation can be used to monitor the
   security levels of the configuration over its lifetime and to indicate
   degradations.},

Abstract = {Biometrics is an emerging technology in this era, which has been widely
   used in many application such as secured access to a computer and any
   other system, criminal identification, person authentication, etc. Face
   recognition is a biometric method of identifying a person by comparing
   the data with the stored information of that person. But the recognition
   of face can be affected by illumination variation, facial expression and
   other issues. Therefore, the authentication using only face image might
   be difficult for the system. To overcome this challenge, biometric
   authentications have to rely on more than one method. In this paper, we
   consider audio-video person authentication based on two sources of
   information. Single modality evidence has limitations in both security
   and robustness. Therefore, here, audio recognition is added with visual
   recognition. Facial features, as well as speech is extracted separately
   from audiovisual data and integrate both the modality for secure user
   authentication. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) is used as
   the speech feature. Viola-Jones and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform
   (SIFT) algorithm are used for visual feature extraction. After the
   extraction of audio and visual features, the feature selection method is
   employed. The two-phase algorithm consisting of statistical analysis,
   Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) is
   proposed to select significant features from audio-visual data. The
   Audio and Video processing is done in two separate phases using machine
   learning algorithms. The results of both the modalities are then
   combined at the decision level based on majority voting. It has been
   observed that multiple modalities of both audio-visual information give
   immensely good results compared to a standalone single modality.},

Abstract = {The security hash algorithm 512 (SHA-512), which is used to verify the
   integrity of it message. involves computational iterations on data. The
   huge computation delay generated in such iterations limits the entire
   throughput of the system and makes it difficult to pipeline the
   computation. We describe it way to pipeline the computation using
   fine-grained pipelining with balanced critical paths. In this method.
   one critical path is broken into two stages by using data forwarding.
   The other critical path is broken into three stages by using computation
   postponement. The resulting critical paths all have two adder-layers
   with some data movements, and thus are balanced. In addition, the method
   also allows register reduction. Also, the similarity in SHA-384 and
   SHA-512 are used for it multi-mode design, which can generate a message
   digest for both versions with the same throughput, but with only a small
   increase in hardware size. Experimental results show that our
   implementation achieved not only the best area performance rate
   (throughput divided by area), but also a higher throughput than almost
   all related work.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the programmable protocol processor (PRO3)
   architecture, which is capable of supporting advanced security services
   over high-speed networks. Security services include such things as a
   firewall, packet and flow classification, connection-state handling
   (i.e., stateful inspection), higher-layer protocol data unit (PDU)
   reassembly (i.e., application-level firewalls), and packet encryption
   and decryption. The PRO3, which is integrated with a high-speed line
   card, attempts to accelerate the performance of the firewall by
   implementing key functionality in hardware and by optimizing the balance
   between hardware and software functions. In this way, significant
   performance enhancements can be achieved, such as making transport
   control protocol (TCP) and Internet protocol (IP) data transactions
   secure, and protecting and separating virtual private networks (VPNs)
   from the external public network. The PRO3 incorporates an innovative
   scheme-a reduced instruction set computing (RISC)-based pipelined module
   with line-rate throughput-that makes it possible to process high- and
   low-level streaming operations efficiently. Using microcode profiling
   and simulation, we give performance results for a stateful-inspection
   firewall application with network address translation (NAT) support. (C)

Abstract = {The application areas of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are
   increasing due to its hardware acceleration and reprogrammable features.
   From large-scale computation systems like cloud, aerospace, and defence
   to small-scale computation systems like home automation and mobile
   phones, the dynamic partial reconfiguration property is found to be
   attractive to design adaptive systems for self-reconfiguration and
   self-healing. The article presents two self- adaptive security systems
   for small scale as well as for large-scale systems. The security system
   is designed to include encryption accelerators and hash code generation
   accelerators. The security system designed for small-scale systems saves
   space and power using hardware adaptation by loading or creating only
   the required accelerator during execution of the application. It uses
   light weight cryptographic algorithms. A second design for large-scale
   systems focuses on getting more throughput by allocating more resources
   to the required accelerator at runtime. Two designs are created for
   hardware adaptation based on the accelerator requirement at runtime.
   Proposed adaptive design for small-scale systems achieved 68.50\%
   decrease in resource consumption and design for large-scale systems
   achieved 25.93\% more throughput than the best existing implementations.},

Abstract = {Recently, as result of dramatic connectivity between devices from a
   computer to mobile systems, security of information and availability of
   the services become more and more challenging. Along with raising the
   number of novel attacks, many types of countermeasures have taken place
   to stop them. One of the most efficient methods to stop network attacks
   is using IDS/IPS Systems. The ultimate goal of an IDPS system is to stop
   security attacks before they have been carried successfully.
   This paper proposed an efficient network-based IDPS System which takes
   multiple counteractions against network attacks. The proposed system's
   first reaction after detecting malicious packets is to generate an alert
   and log them; if the number of packets goes beyond threshold limit in
   one second, the second counteraction takes place to block the attackers
   IP address through firewall. Finally, if the system fails to block these
   packets, the third counteraction takes place to remotely stop the
   corresponding service. In this case the system prevents an attack from
   being successfully carried.},

Abstract = {This paper propose a meta-heuristic algorithm known as the enhanced
   cuckoo search (ECS) algorithm for contingency constrained economic load
   dispatch (CCELD) in order to relieve transmission line overloading. The
   power system security assessment deals with finding out the secure and
   the insecure operating states, whereas the security enhancement deals
   with the necessary control action against overloads under contingency
   scenario. By generation rescheduling the overloaded lines can be
   relieved from the severity. In the proposed ECS algorithm, in order to
   improve the solution vectors, dynamically variable parameters namely the
   step size and the probability are incorporated instead of the fixed
   values of the parameters. The CCELD problem includes scheduling of
   generators to minimize the severity index with minimum fuel cost. A
   standard IEEE-30 bus system is considered to study the effectiveness of
   the proposed ECS algorithm for CCELD problem. Numerical results reveals
   that, for 100 iterations the proposed ECS algorithm out performs the
   other state-of-the-art algorithms, namely cuckoo search (CS), Bat
   algorithm (BA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm in
   obtaining the minimum fuel cost and the minimum severity index in
   minimum time. Thus, the proposed ECS algorithm is found to be efficient
   to obtain the solution of contingency constrained economic load dispatch
   problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Threshold cryptography aims at enhancing the availability and security
   of decryption and signature schemes by splitting private keys into
   several (say n) shares (typically, each of size comparable to the
   original secret key). In these schemes, a quorum of at least (t <= n)
   servers needs to act upon a message to produce the result (decrypted
   value or signature), while corrupting less than t servers maintains the
   scheme's security. For about two decades, extensive study was dedicated
   to this subject, which created a number of notable results. So far, most
   practical threshold signatures, where servers act non-interactively,
   were analyzed in the limited static corruption model (where the
   adversary chooses which servers will be corrupted at the system's
   initialization stage). Existing threshold encryption schemes that
   withstand the strongest combination of adaptive malicious corruptions
   (allowing the adversary to corrupt servers at any time based on its
   complete view), and chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA) all require
   interaction (in the non-idealized model) and attempts to remedy this
   problem resulted only in relaxed schemes. The same is true for threshold
   signatures secure under chosen-message attacks (CMA).
   To date (for about 10 years), it has been open whether there are
   non-interactive threshold schemes providing the highest security
   (namely, CCA-secure encryption and CMA-secure signature) with scalable
   shares (i.e., as short as the original key) and adaptive security. This
   paper answers this question affirmatively by presenting such efficient
   decryption and signature schemes within a unified algebraic framework.},

Title = {Application design phase risk assessment framework using cloud security
   domains},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {55},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Security risk assessment is done to identify the vulnerabilities of a
   client's application and develop strong security measures within
   budgetary constraints. However, while migrating to the Cloud platform, a
   generic notion of their publicly available security policies make it
   challenging for clients to assess the security threats solely relevant
   to their applications. Additionally, traditional risk assessment
   techniques cannot address these challenges as they neither consider
   cloud security domains as assessment criteria nor identifies critical
   system resources that need to be protected in the likelihood of a
   successful attack. In order to address these challenges, this paper
   presents a risk assessment framework for clients' applications that is
   characterized by the inclusion of cloud security metrics to perform risk
   assessment during the design phase of an application by incorporating
   the techniques of cloud misuse patterns. It also helps improve the
   security requirements phase that precedes risk assessment, by
   illustrating clients how different attack scenarios can spread through
   the applications by using the concepts of percolation centrality and
   probabilistic state transition diagrams. One of the key findings this
   work address is how to systematically gain a distinction between
   multiple system resources belonging to the same security defense
   priority level.},

   group communication systems (GCSs) in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) to
   dynamically adjust operational settings to best satisfy
   application-imposed performance and security requirements, leveraging
   the inherent tradeoff between security and performance properties of the
   system. These adaptive security protocols include an intrusion detection
   protocol for dealing with insider attacks and a scalable region-based
   hierarchical group key management protocol for dealing with outsider
   attacks. Our design settings include the time interval over which
   intrusion detection should he performed, and the regional area size for
   the region-based hierarchical group key management protocol for group
   key management. When given a set of parameter values characterizing
   operational and environmental conditions of a GCS, we identify optimal
   design settings to be used by the system dynamically to maximize the
   mean time to security failure of the system while minimizing the total
   group communication cost incurred for GCSs in MANET environments.},

Abstract = {Future Software Defined Radio (SDR) waveforms require increasing
   throughputs and at the same time security and anti-jamming capabilities
   to support wide variety of applications for military, commercial and
   civilian applications. It requires combination of spectral efficiency
   and anti-jamming capabilities. To meet this requirements, a multi-mode
   wideband waveform for software defined radio based on hybrid Continuous
   Phase Modulation \& Code Division Multiple Access (CPM-CDMA) concept is
   proposed in this paper. The proposed waveform has three modes of
   operation and maximum achievable throughput of 1.33 Mbps. The user
   throughput of the proposed hybrid waveform is compared with the
   classical CDMA scheme using the same bandwidth. Due to higher spectral
   efficiency provided by CPM, it is shown that the proposed waveform
   achieves higher throughput for appropriate choice of pulse length L and
   modulation index h as compared to the CDMA based waveform. At the end
   BER performance of hybrid CPM-CDMA proposed mode is analyzed and is
   compared with traditional CDMA based waveform.},

   The proposed scheme has constant size ciphertexts and achieves adaptive

Abstract = {Stabilizing control of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is an important yet
   challenging problem since system modelling may face the coexistence of
   multiple uncertainties including unknown disturbances, unknown bounded
   delays, stochastic malicious attack and stochastic mode switching in
   complex environment, which cause system performance to deteriorate or
   even be unstable. However, the above uncertainties are rarely considered
   simultaneously in existing study. To this end, a novel system model is
   proposed to reflect not only the nonlinear characteristics, external
   disturbances and time-varying delays, but also the randomly occurring
   deception attacks, which is energy-constrained and lead to the system
   mode switching. We aim at designing a controller such that the system
   achieve the prescribed Ho., disturbance rejection level. By constructing
   an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) and using the
   stochastic analysis techniques, the addressed controller design problem
   is transformed to an convex optimization problem, which can be solved by
   a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. An example is given to show
   the effectiveness of the designed controller.},

Abstract = {Mobile offloading systems have been proposed to migrate complex
   computations from mobile devices to powerful servers. While this may be
   beneficial from the performance and energy perspective, it certainly
   exhibits new challenges in terms of security due to increased data
   transmission over networks with potentially unknown threats. Among
   possible security issues are timing attacks which are not prevented by
   traditional cryptographic security. Metrics on which offloading
   decisions are based must include security aspects in addition to
   performance and energy-efficiency. This paper aims at quantifying the
   security attributes and their impact on the performance of mobile
   offloading systems. The offloading system is modeled as a hybrid CTMC
   and queueing model. The proposed model focuses on state transition and
   state-based control. The quantification analysis is carried out for
   steady-state behavior of the CTMC model as to optimize the weighted-sum
   cost measure. By transforming the security model to a model with
   absorbing state, we compute the ``mean time to security failure{''}
   (MTTSF) measure. Finally, a security and performance tradeoff measure is
   computed based on the system model and optimum parameter set is found
   for the system.},

Abstract = {Verifiable random functions (VRFs) are essentially digital signatures
   with additional properties, namely verifiable uniqueness and
   pseudorandomness, which make VRFs a useful tool, e.g., to prevent
   enumeration in DNSSEC Authenticated Denial of Existence and the CONIKS
   key management system, or in the random committee selection of the
   Algorand blockchain.
   Most standard-model VRFs rely on admissible hash functions (AHFs) to
   achieve security against adaptive attacks in the standard model. Known
   AHF constructions are based on error-correcting codes, which yield
   asymptotically efficient constructions. However, previous works do not
   clarify how the code should be instantiated concretely in the real
   world. The rate and the minimal distance of the selected code have
   significant impact on the efficiency of the resulting cryptosystem,
   therefore it is unclear if and how the aforementioned constructions can
   be used in practice.
   First, we explain inherent limitations of code-based AHFs. Concretely,
   we assume that even if we were given codes that achieve the well-known
   Gilbert-Varshamov or McEliece-Rodemich-Rumsey-Welch bounds, existing
   AHF-based constructions of verifiable random functions (VRFs) can only
   be instantiated quite inefficiently. Then we introduce and construct
   computational AHFs (cAHFs). While classical AHFs are
   information-theoretic, and therefore work even in presence of
   computationally unbounded adversaries, cAHFs provide only security
   against computationally bounded adversaries. However, we show that cAHFs
   can be instantiated significantly more efficiently. Finally, we use our
   cAHF to construct the currently most efficient verifiable random
   function with full adaptive security in the standard model.},

Abstract = {An important problem in the Electrical Power System operation is the
   steady-state security prediction. In order to take into account the load
   uncertainty, in this paper the authors apply a Monte-Carlo method
   together with an opportune Security Index to evaluate in a preventive
   manner the probability to fall in insecure operating state, by
   determining the security index probability density function. For this
   aim, in a previous paper proposed by the authors, it has been possible
   to take advantage of an Artificial Neural Network, trained to evaluate
   the Security Index probability density function in presence of the
   optimal economical dispatching of the generation powers for the load
   forecast. In the present paper, a more complex scenario is considered
   where the security analysis can suggest to the dispatcher to determine
   also non-optimal economical operating conditions to improve security. So
   a new, more complex, organization of the Artificial Neural Network
   training stage, necessary in order to obtain increased generalization
   capacity in the production stage, has been considered. In the first part
   of the paper the used security index, the Monte-Carlo simulation and the
   neural network structure with its learning algorithm utilized by the
   authors for the particular problem are briefly recalled. Finally, a
   numerical application on a simple electrical test system is shown
   pointing out very encouraging results.},

Abstract = {With the expansion of smart device users, the security mechanism of
   these devices in terms of user authentication has been advanced a lot.
   These mechanisms consist of a pattern based authentication, biometric
   based authentication, etc. For security purpose whenever a user fails to
   authenticate themselves, these devices get locked. But as these devices
   consist of numerous applications (document creator, pdf viewer,
   e-banking, Social networking app, etc.), locking of the whole devices
   prevents the user from using any of the applications. Since the variety
   of applications provided by the devices have different security needs,
   we feel it is better to have application level security rather than
   device level. Here, in this paper, we have proposed a behavioral
   biometric based user authentication mechanism for application level
   security. First, we have performed a risk assessment of different
   applications. Then for complete protection, static multi-modal
   (keystroke and mouse dynamics) authentication at the start of an
   interactive session, and a continuous keystroke authentication during
   this session is performed. An analysis of the proposed authentication
   mechanism has been conducted on the basis of false acceptance rate
   (FAR), false rejection rate (FRR) and equal error rate (EER). The static
   multi-modal authentication achieved a FAR of 0.89\%, FRR of 1.2\% and
   EER of 1.04\% using J48 classification algorithm. Whereas the continuous
   keystroke authentication has been analyzed by the time (no. of
   keystrokes pressed) taken to capture an intruder.},

Title = {Real-time dynamic security analysis of power systems using strategic PMU

Abstract = {Fast and accurate online dynamic security analysis (DSA) is the key
   enabler for secure operation of modern power systems. Real-time
   assessment of the current power system operating state and increased
   awareness about plausible future insecurity can enable necessary
   operational and control measures to ensure secure operation. This paper
   proposes an ensemble decision tree (DT)-based online DSA method for
   large-scale interconnected power system networks using wide area
   measurement (WAMS) with phasor measurement units (PMU). A novel
   attribute selection method has been demonstrated for optimizing PMU
   installation at strategic buses in large-scale power networks.
   Multi-stage screening of the initial measurements has been done to
   minimize the data acquisition cost and computation overhead, which are
   the key challenges in real-time DSA. The ensemble DT classifier was
   trained offline using data from the operational model of the power
   system under different system loading and contingency conditions. The
   trained classifier provides online security assessment and classifies
   the power system's current operating state as secure or insecure based
   on real-time measurements of the key attributes by selective PMUs. The
   proposed scheme was tested on IEEE 118-bus system, and the results
   demonstrate that it has the potential to be used as a reliable online
   DSA method.},

Abstract = {In this work, we design a method for creating public key broadcast
   encryption systems. Our main technical innovation is based on a new
   ``two equation{''} technique for revoking users. This technique results
   in two key contributions:
   First, our new scheme has ciphertext size overhead O(r), where r is the
   number of revoked users, and the size of public and private keys is only
   a constant number of group elements from an elliptic-curve group of
   prime order. In addition, the public key allows us to encrypt to an
   unbounded number of users. Our system is the first to achieve such
   parameters. We give two versions of our scheme: a simpler version which
   we prove to be selectively secure in the standard model under a new, but
   non-interactive assumption, and another version that employs the new
   dual system encryption technique of Waters to obtain adaptive security
   under the d-BDH and decisional Linear assumptions.
   Second, we show that our techniques can be used to realize
   Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) systems with non-monotonic access
   formulas, where our key storage is significantly more efficient than
   previous solutions. This result is also proven selectively secure in the
   standard model under our new non-interactive assumption.},

Title = {On the security of functional encryption in the generic group model},
Journal = {DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 27},
Abstract = {In the context of functional encryption (FE), a weak security notion
   called selective security, which enforces the adversary to complete a
   challenge prior to seeing the system parameters, is used to argue in
   favor of the security of proposed cryptosystems. These results are often
   considered as an intermediate step to design adaptively secure
   cryptosystems. In fact, selectively secure FE schemes play a role of
   more than an intermediate step in many cases. If we restrict our
   attention to group-based constructions, it is not surprising to find
   several selectively secure FE schemes such that no successful adaptive
   adversary is found yet and/or it is also believed that no adaptive
   adversary will be found in practice even in the future. In this paper,
   we aim at clarifying these beliefs rigorously in the ideal model, called
   generic group model (GGM). First, we refine the definitions of the GGM
   and the security notions for FE scheme for clarification. Second, we
   formalize a group-based FE scheme with some conditions and then show
   that for any group-based FE scheme satisfying these conditions we can
   reduce from its selective security in the standard model to adaptive
   security in the GGM, in particular, regardless of the functionality of
   FE schemes. Our reduction is applicable to many existing selectively
   secure FE schemes with various functionalities, e.g., the FE scheme for
   quadratic functions of Baltico et al. (CRYPTO, 2017), the predicate
   encryption scheme of Katz et al. (J Cryptol in 26:191-224, 2013), and
   Boneh and Boyen's identity-based encryption scheme (EUROCRYPT 2004).},

Abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment has a dynamic nature with high
   risks of confidentiality, integrity, and availability violations. The
   loss of information, denial of access, information leakage, collusion,
   technical failures, and data security breaches are difficult to predict
   and anticipate in advance. These types of nonstationarity are one of the
   main issues in the design of the reliable IoT infrastructure capable of
   mitigating their consequences. It is not sufficient to propose solutions
   for a given scenario, but mechanisms to adapt the current solution to
   changes in the environment. In this article, we present a multicloud
   storage architecture called WA-MRC-RRNS that combines the weighted
   access scheme, threshold secret sharing, and redundant residue number
   system with multiple failure detection/recovery mechanisms and
   homomorphic ciphers. We provide a theoretical analysis of the
   probability of information loss, data redundancy, speed of
   encoding/decoding, and show how to dynamically configure parameters to
   cope with different objective preferences, workloads, and cloud
   properties. We propose a multiobjective optimization mechanism to adjust
   redundancy, encryption-decryption speed, and data loss probability.
   Comprehensive experimental analysis with real data shows that our
   approach provides a secure way to mitigate the uncertainty of the use of
   untrusted and not reliable IoT infrastructure.},

Title = {A polymorphic heterogeneous security architecture for edge-enabled smart
   grids},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {67},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The emergence of edge computing alleviates the network congestion,
   delay, and packet loss of cloud computing enabled smart grid
   architecture in big data scenarios, greatly improving the operation
   efficiency and communication quality of the smart grid. However, edge
   computing architecture also brings great security risks to the smart
   grid. This paper proposes a Polymorphic Heterogeneous Security
   Architecture (PHSA) for edge enabled smart grid, to assure the key
   services in the smart grid. Based on the dynamic heterogeneous
   redundancy architecture, the proposed architecture introduces
   intelligent scheduling of executors, intelligent arbitration of
   multi-state service response, cleaning and reconstruction of executors,
   and attack surface management. We establish a closed-loop core control
   process of decision and processing, adjustment and scheduling, cleaning
   reconstruction, migration, and recovery. Furthermore, a dynamic
   scheduling algorithm based on executor credit and heterogeneity is
   proposed. The simulation results show that, compared with the
   traditional smart grid security architecture, the PHSA has better
   defense ability and system reliability, significantly improving the
   security of edge enabled smart grid system. Besides, compared with the
   random scheduling strategy, the proposed dynamic executor scheduling
   algorithm can further improve the security of the system.},

Abstract = {With the advent of internet of things (IoT) and IoT multimedia services
   in real-time applications, including smart healthcare, smart home, and
   smart connected transportation, IoT multimedia systems have
   significantly enhanced the lifestyle. However, the increased number of
   connected heterogeneous IoT multimedia devices have resulted in several
   vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. The existing multimedia in IoT
   multimedia security solutions are insufficient for detecting such
   complex attacks and require a self-adaptive security mechanism that can
   monitor the changing environment and detect, mitigate, plan, and prevent
   future prospective attacks in real time. In this study, we conduct a
   study of several self-adaptive security approaches for IoT multimedia
   and analyze them based on critical, security metrics to determine their
   level of support and the achieved satisfaction for IoT multimedia
   services. The evaluation results show significant insights, challenges,
   and concerns in the existing approaches, which can provide vital
   information for the development of future IoT multimedia security
   research. We propose a self-adaptive security model for IoT multimedia
   and discuss a case utilizing a mobile e-health system, where we use an
   adaptation model (using monitor-analyze-plan-execute over a shared
   knowledge adaptation loop) to determine the adaptation requirement based
   on the confidence level of several security factors. The adaptation
   requirement depicts that adaptation is required for stabilizing the
   security factors in a continuous context-changing sustainable e-health
   IoT multimedia environment.},

Abstract = {Multi-modal biometrics enjoy more merits than their single-modal
   counterparts in terms of accuracy performance and security. The fusion
   of hand-based biometrics such as palmprint and palmvein is
   straightforward since they can be acquired simultaneously with a
   customized image acquisition device. Conjugate 2DPalmHash Code (CTDPHC),
   which is constructed by 2DPalmHash Codes (2DPHCs) of palmprint and
   palmvein, is proposed as a cancelable multi-modal biometric. To
   determine the proper fusion strategy of 2DPHCs of palmprint and
   palmvein, different fusion rules at score level are compared and
   discussed. The transposition orientation ranges of 2DPHCs are also
   fine-tuned to improve the accuracy performance. Compared with 2DPHC,
   CTDPHC enjoys higher verification accuracy and stronger anti-counterfeit
   ability, while trades neither computational complexity nor storage cost.},

Abstract = {This paper first presents a network flow model and uses the
   out-of-kilter algorithm (OKA) for solving the on-line economic power
   dispatch with N and N - 1 security. A fast N - 1 security analysis
   method solved by the OKA is developed to seek out all the
   overconstrained cases for all possible single line outages, and then an
   `N - 1 constrained zone' is formed which is coordinated with the network
   flow model. Based on the normal operating state, a corrective
   incremental network flow model of economic dispatch for the
   overconstrained cases is established. In consequence, the calculation
   burden is reduced significantly and the shortcoming of network flow
   programming is mitigated to some extent. The proposed model and
   algorithm are tested on an IEEE 30-bus system. Encouraging results are
   obtained.},

Abstract = {Computer network is a dynamic entity whose state changes with the
   introduction of new services, installation of new network operating
   system, and addition of new hardware components, creation of new user
   roles and by attacks from various actors instigated by aggressors.
   Unauthorized intrusion into a computer system or network is one of the
   most serious threats to computer security. Intrusion detection systems
   have been developed to provide early warning of an intrusion so that
   defensive action can be taken to prevent or minimize damage. Intrusion
   detection involves detecting unusual patterns of activity or patterns of
   activity that are known to correlate with intrusions. One of the two
   most publicized threats to security is the intruder (the other is
   viruses), often referred to as a hacker or cracker. Various security
   mechanisms employed in the network does not give the complete picture of
   security of complete network. In this paper, we have derived more number
   of probabilities for prediction rules and implemented those
   probabilities in the simulation model web application to protect the
   datacenter.},

Pages = {275-299},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This article presents a concise reliability analysis of network security
   abstracted from stochastic modeling, reliability, and queuing theories.
   Network security analysis is composed of threats, their impacts, and
   recovery of the failed systems. A unique framework with a collection of
   the key reliability models is presented here to guide the determination
   of the system reliability based on the strength of malicious acts and
   performance of the recovery processes. A unique model, called
   Attack-obstacle model, is also proposed here for analyzing systems with
   immunity growth features. Most computer science curricula do not contain
   courses in reliability modeling applicable to different areas of
   computer engineering. Hence, the topic of reliability analysis is often
   too diffuse to most computer engineers and researchers dealing with
   network security. This work is thus aimed at shedding some light on this
   issue, which can be useful in identifying models, their assumptions and
   practical parameters for estimating the reliability of threatened
   systems and for assessing the performance of recovery facilities. It can
   also be useful for the classification of processes and states regarding
   the reliability of information systems. Systems with stochastic
   behaviors undergoing queue operations and random state transitions can
   also benefit from the approaches presented here. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {We are living in an era where computers govern the educational process.
   The market is flooded with puzzles, games, quizzes or other kinds of
   applications destined to help teachers explain different concepts and to
   enable students to practice their skills and test the knowledge. For all
   these systems, be them computers, server or embedded devices, the
   internet connection is the essential aspect. As a result, we have
   children and students working with devices that are exposed to the
   highest degree of security issues and threats. Attacks are continuously
   evolving, becoming more flexible, adaptable and hard to detect, and
   leaving children and students vulnerable to malicious software that can
   either collect sensitive information about them or expose them to
   inappropriate content. Because of this, it is only natural that security
   solutions became of significant importance for the tech educational
   industry. Computers, servers and embedded devices are exposed to the
   highest degree of security issues and threats since the internet became
   an essential need. Attacks are continuously evolving, becoming more
   flexible, adaptable and hard to detect. This made only natural the shift
   towards adaptive security oriented solutions. One of the security those
   solutions is represented by anomaly based intrusion detection
   techniques. Anomaly based intrusion detection systems build a baseline
   of normal behavior. For a Linux based operating system, which represents
   a great percent of the platforms used in education, this is accomplished
   by monitoring a given process or sets of processes. Any significant
   deviation from the baseline model is flagged as malicious activity. This
   paper proposes a framework for intrusion detection using system call
   traces captured from services running on a container. The work done is
   based on The Australian Defence Force Academy Linux Dataset, better
   known as ADFA-LD. The analysis is done taking into consideration the
   temporal allocation of the system calls. The classification module is
   based on supervised machine learning techniques. To test the accuracy of
   the framework, a case study involving a database application running
   under a Linux container is analyzed. The results together with the
   proposed framework implementation are described in details.},

Abstract = {In order to ensure high-reliability and high-security of the power
   supply for major politic, economic and culture activities, emergency
   power supply vehicle is often used to provide backup by power companies.
   Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) is widely utilized to join the vehicle
   into power grid. The switching process lasts fora few seconds, during
   which power supply is shortly interrupted and the normal operation of
   sensitive load is affected. Although UPS power system can realize
   uninterruptible power supply for important users, its corollary
   equipment is relatively complex and diverse. Moreover, it's usually
   designed as an integrated structure and high-power UPS cannot be loaded
   on the vehicle. To overcome the shortcoming of current power supply
   vehicle and meet the uninterruptible large-capacity power supply demand
   in special period, this paper proposes two mobile power supply solutions
   based on Solid State Transfer Switch (SSTS). Application test shows that
   the designed power supply vehicle based on SSTS has multiple functions,
   reliable performance and strong practicability.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a multi-state Markov model for a coal power
   generating unit. The paper proposes a technique for the estimation of
   transition intensities (rates) between the various generating capacity
   levels of the unit based on field observation. The technique can be
   applied to such units where output generating capacity is uniformly
   distributed. In order to estimate the transition intensities a special
   Markov chain embedded in the observed capacity process was defined. By
   using this technique, all transition intensities can be estimated from
   the observed realization of the unit generating capacity stochastic
   process. The proposed multi-state Markov model was used to calculate
   important reliability indices such as the Forced Outage Rate (FOR), the
   Expected Energy Not Supplied (EENS) to consumers, etc. These indices
   were found for short-time periods (about 100 h). It was shown that these
   indices are sensibly different from those calculated for a long-term
   range. Such Markov models could be very useful for power system security
   analysis and short-term operating decisions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Security and INTelligence SYStem is an Italian research project which
   aims to create an integrated system for the analysis of multi-modal data
   sources (text, images, video, audio), to assist operators in homeland
   security applications. Within this project the Scientific Research Unit
   of the University of Palermo is responsible of the image and video
   analysis activity. The SRU of Palermo developed a web service based
   architecture that provides image and video analysis capabilities to the
   integrated analysis system. The developed architecture uses both state
   of the art techniques, adapted to cope with the particular problem at
   hand, and new algorithms to provide the following services: image
   cropping, image forgery detection, face and people detection, weapon
   detection and classification, and terrorist logo recognition. In the
   last phase of the project we plan to include in our system new services,
   mainly oriented to the video analysis, to study and understand the
   behaviour of individuals, either alone or in a group.},

Abstract = {In recent years, too many oil pipelines system explosion occurred at
   home and abroad, which has brought great pollution to the ecological
   environment. In this paper, a consecutive-k-out-of-n: F system is used
   to model the security problem of the oil transportation system. In this
   model, we assume the oil pipeline system has n identical pump stations
   and R repairmen taking charge of the pump stations. The working times of
   the pump stations and the repair times of the failed pump stations are
   assumed to be independent and identically exponential distributions. All
   vacations of the repairmen are independent and identically distributed
   as an exponential. Under these assumptions, by the pairs (i, j), the
   states of the system are listed. Therefore, the state transition rate
   matrix is obtained. The reliability indexes of the oil pipeline system
   can be obtained, too. Finally, the Run ge-Kutta method is used to a
   special case, and the result is that the structure of the system itself
   affects the security significantly comparing with the external repair
   service.},

Abstract = {Network state changes are one of the major reasons of instability in
   network, resulting in disruptions, undesirable performance degradation
   or security vulnerabilities. Although the states before and after the
   update can be easily guaranteed correct, the intermediate states often
   produce the instantaneous incorrect network behaviors. In this paper, we
   propose General Consistencies Guarantee (GCG), a fast and consistent
   solution to update the computer network in the Software-Definition
   Networks (SDNs). GCG updates single flow to ensure connectivity and
   policy consistency by adjusting updating order and inserting two rules.
   GCG also guarantees performance consistency with the dependency graph.
   Simulation experimental results show that success rate of GCG are
   significantly improved.},

   two emergency control strategies namely generator shedding and load

Abstract = {To charge the battery of electric vehicles (EVs), inductive power
   transfer (IPT) system has been considered to be more appropriate than
   traditional plug-in system especially for its security and convenience.
   This study proposes a hybrid IPT system for EVs charging applications
   adopting one transmitter coil with series compensation and two receiver
   coils with series compensation and LCL compensation. With the help of
   the two receiver coils and proper parameters design, the proposed system
   can naturally obtain constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV)
   outputs and the maximum output power can be naturally limited which can
   prevent the system from possible overload. Therefore, the reliability of
   the proposed system is increased. Since the mode switching process can
   be automatically realised according to the value of battery equivalent
   load without extra control strategy and circuit, the fixed-frequency
   control can be used. Therefore, not only zero phase angle condition, but
   also the soft switching can be achieved. The theoretical analysis is
   presented with the design process of the IPT coils and resonance
   parameters for required battery charging profile. The performance of the
   system is verified by a 3.3 kW experimental prototype. The experimental
   results coincide well with the theoretical analysis.},

Abstract = {In support process of equipment systems, spare inventory strategy,
   turnaround time, and product maintenance strategies have a great impact
   on system support time, and support time is one of the most important
   factors for the readiness and the task persistence of systems.
   Therefore, the use of reasonable spare inventory strategy, as well as
   maintenance and support decisions to systems is essential to improve
   system availability, security and system cost reducing. Maintenance
   strategy can be formulated based on the situation in which the products
   are monitored. For a single-component system, current research around
   its multi-state transferring have been quite mature, in which the
   conversion rate defined in a different state in Markov process can be
   clearly showed by conversion relationship between different state.
   However, the state transition process involved mostly considers the
   processes of repairing only, and rarely considers the impact to system
   availability by the transition of failure rate caused by changes in
   components, spare replacement strategies and spare supply. To solve this
   problem, this paper considered a single-component system with two
   derating states, and discussed its steady-state availability through
   variable spare replacement probability and different spare fill rate
   levels. With model of the system with two derating states established,
   generalized Markov method was used to solve the relationships between
   replacement timing and system availability with the level of spare fill
   rate considered. Finally, through the analysis of results, the
   preliminary conclusions were obtained. The results could clearly reveal
   the impacts of spare replacement strategy and spare fill rate in
   single-component system.},

Abstract = {The standardized communication protocol and the universal application of
   intelligent electronic devices in edge networks provide technical
   support to the realization of smart cities and also bring network
   security issues that cannot be ignored. How to analyze and
   quantitatively assess the vulnerability of the edge network has become
   an important issue that needs to be solved urgently in the edge network
   security risk control. Based on the analysis of the vulnerability
   mechanism, this paper proposes the selection criteria and generation
   methods of vulnerability indicators and of composite vulnerability
   indicators, respectively. In addition, this paper proposes an improved
   vulnerability severity rating method to analyze the vulnerability of the
   system and potential security threats. This paper describes the security
   risk status of vulnerable points based on the state transition of the
   state offensive and defensive graph and implements the description of
   the security risk status of attacks in terms of attack frequency, attack
   success rate and harm. Experimental results justify the effectiveness of
   the proposed solution.},

Abstract = {``An access control device has been used for securing valuable
   properties and lives from sinister people{''} {[}1]. Recently, these
   security device technologies have been improved tremendously in
   providing security for people through various methods. ``Nevertheless,
   these methods are not individually perfect to provide optimal security.
   These, most of the time, are not convenient for a wide range of users
   (i.e, the innocent users who do not pose any threat) due to access time
   delay and several layers of authentication. The proposed security system
   should exhibit capabilities that support adaptive security procedures
   for a diverse range of users, so most innocent users require a minimum
   layer of identity authentication and verification while suspicious users
   may require passing through some additional layers of security
   authentication and verification{''} {[}1]. This paper proposes ``a novel
   smart access control (SAC) system, which can identify and categorize
   suspicious users from the analysis of one's activities and bio
   information. The SAC system observes and records users' daily behavioral
   activities. From the analysis of the collected data, it selectively
   chooses certain users for additional layers of authentication procedure
   and quickly isolates those individuals who might pass through scrutiny
   by security personnel. Due to this adaptive feature, the SAC system not
   only minimizes delays and provides more convenience to the users but
   also enhances the security measure{''} {[}1]. Moreover, a novel idea of
   DPIN, a concept that uses memory and analytical potency of a user to
   dynamic generation, and updates ones security key is proposed.},

Abstract = {Homeland security systems, special forces, unmanned aerial vehicles
   (UAV), and marine patrols require low cost, high performance, multi-mode
   visible through infrared (VIS-IR) wavelength optical systems to identify
   and neutralize potential threats that often arise at long ranges and
   under poor visibility conditions. Long range and wide spectral
   performance requirements favor reflective optical system design
   solutions. The limited field of view of such designs can be
   significantly enhanced by the use of catadioptric optical solutions that
   utilize molded or diamond point machined VIS-IR lenses downstream from
   reflective objective optics. A common optical aperture that services
   multiple modes of field-of-view, operating wavelength, and includes
   laser ranging and spotting, provides the highest utility and is most
   ideal for size and weight. Such a design also often requires fast,
   highly aspheric, reflective, refractive, and sometimes diffractive
   surfaces using high performance and aggressively light-weighted
   materials that demand the finest of manufacturing technologies. Visible
   wavelength performance sets the bar for component optical surface
   irregularity on the order of 20 nm RMS and surface finishes less than
   3.0 nm RMS. Aluminum mirrors and structures can also be precision
   machined to yield ``snap together alignment{''} or limited compensation
   assembly approaches to reduce cost and enhance interchangeability.
   Diamond point turning, die cast and investment cast mirror substrates
   and structures, computerized optical polishing, mirror replication, lens
   molding and other advanced manufacturing technologies can all be used to
   minimize the cost of this type of optical equipment. This paper
   discusses the tradeoffs among materials and process selection for
   catadioptric, multi-mode systems that are under development for a
   variety of DoD and Homeland Security applications. Several examples are
   profiled to illuminate the confluence of applicable design and
   manufacturing technologies.},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) have very big opportunities in businesses and
   life, especially Internet Banking, Healthcare and Transportation. But
   developers face challenges in security especially for sensitive data to
   use IoT safely with Internet Banking. In this paper, a secure IoT
   connection between clients and broker server based on iris recognition
   system (Authentication server) will be proposed. The proposed iris
   recognition system will communicate with MQTT broker server to increase
   authentication instead of using normal text method (username/password).
   The proposed authentication server in this paper is to use iris as
   uni-modal biometric trait, by applying different scenarios of
   multi-biometrics other than the multi-modal, to develop and implement
   iris-based recognition system. In feature extraction phase, the fusion
   between vectors of Delta-Mean (DM) and Multi-Algorithm-Mean (MAM)
   executed in a parallel mode. Then, followed by the proposed reduction
   method, reduced the feature vector size keeping higher performance.
   Finally, classification is adopted by using Euclidian Distance (ED)
   classifier. It is suitable for secure MQTT connection message to
   authenticate right client in sensitive application like bank transfer
   operations.},

Title = {Context-Aware Quantification for VANET Security: A Markov Chain-Based
   Scheme},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {173618-173626},
Abstract = {Recently, the quantification of VANET security has drawn significant
   attention due to the lack of standard computational metrics. The salient
   features of VANET, such as highly dynamic connections, sensitive
   information sharing, and unreliable fading channels, make the security
   quantification challenging. Accurate measurement for VANET security
   depends on the sufficient understanding of ``context'', or making sense
   of the states, environment, or situation. This article proposes a
   context-aware security quantification scheme for VANET based on the
   Markov chain. Firstly, a Homogeneous Continuous-Time Markov Chain
   (HCTMC)-based security state model is designed for VANET. The value of
   each state of the HCTMC is determined with a value function that
   incorporates the security strength of transmitted data, dynamic and
   randomness of the vehicular channel, and transmission delay of the
   current situated environment of VANETs. Finally, the state transition
   matrix is derived based on the Homogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain
   (HDTMC) and Homogeneous Poisson Process (HPP). Simulation results show
   that the security quantification method enables the VANET's system to
   adopt context-aware defense strategies according to the situated
   environment.},

Year = {2019},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Recent research indicates that future power networks will witness a
   major enhancement in renewable energy-based distributed generation (DG).
   The impact of DG and distribution management system (DMS) action can be
   directly and easily implemented in the distribution networks for the
   improvement of its voltage security states. In the first phase of this
   paper, the voltage security state of the distribution network is
   identified using combined Kohonen's self-organizing feature map (SOFM)
   and learning vector quantization (LVQ) algorithm. Two indicators namely
   voltage stability index (VSI) and distribution system stability
   indicator (DSSI) are used in this paper for verification of
   classification result. To ensure voltage security, it is essential to
   improve the voltage profile of the system. In the next phase, genetic
   algorithm (GA) and spider monkey optimization (SMO) techniques have been
   applied to find the optimal location and size of DG for voltage security
   state improvement of the reconfigured distribution system. Accurate
   allocation of DG can help in demand side management (DSM) for providing
   better service to the consumers in real time in smart grid scenario.
   This methodology has been tested on IEEE 33 bus, IEEE 69 bus, and Indian
   85 bus practical radial distribution system. Result shows that the
   proposed methodology can successfully and appropriately identify the
   voltage security states of power system by combined SOFM and LVQ
   algorithms, and utilization of suitable amount of DGs at best locations
   as obtained from SMO algorithm can improve the operating states of
   distribution network in terms of voltage security.},

   build on recent algorithmic advances in sensor fusion, and present the
   design and implementation of a novel, multi-mode embedded signal
   processing system for detection of people and vehicles using acoustic
   and seismic sensors. Here, by ``multi-mode{''}, we mean that the system
   has available a complementary set of configurations that are optimized
   for different trade-offs. The multi-mode capability delivered by the
   proposed system is useful to supporting long lifetime (long term,
   energy-efficient ``standby{''} operation), while also supporting
   optimized accuracy during critical time periods (e.g., when a potential
   threat is detected). In our target detection system, we apply a
   strategically-configured suite of single- and dual-modality signal
   processing techniques together with dataflow-based design optimization
   for energy-efficient, real-time implementation. Through experiments
   using a Raspberry Pi platform, we demonstrate the capability of our

Abstract = {Isolated microgrid power systems are prone to large frequency and
   voltage deviations, since they have limited generation and finite
   inertia and may include pulse power loads and large proportion of
   dynamic loads. Thus, they require effective power management methods to
   operate optimally, while satisfying operating and security constraints.
   In this paper, a novel integrated security-constrained model-based power
   management approach is proposed for isolated microgrids in all-electric
   ships during the normal/alert operating state. The new power management
   method was formulated as a multi-objective optimal control problem. A
   method based on the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II was
   developed to solve the problem. The developed integrated
   security-constrained power management approach was applied to a notional
   all-electric ship computer model. The simulation results, conducted in
   PSCAD, showed the effectiveness of the new power management method.},

Abstract = {Cyber security is identified as an emerging concern for information
   technology management in business and society, owing to swift advances
   in telecommunication and wireless technologies. Cyberspace security has
   had a tremendous impact on numerous crucial infrastructures. Along with
   current security status data, historical data should be acquired by the
   system to implement the latest cyber security defense and protection. It
   also makes intelligent decisions that can provide adaptive security
   management and control. An intelligent cyber security framework using
   Hyperparameter Tuning based on Regularized Long Short-Term Memory
   (HT-RLSTM) technique was developed in this work to elevate the security
   level of core system assets. To detect various attacks, the proposed
   framework was trained and tested on the collection of data. Owing to
   missing values, poor scaling, imbalanced and overlapped data, the data
   was primarily incomplete and inconsistent. To elevate the decision
   making for detecting attacks, the inconsistent or unstructured data
   issue was addressed. The missing values were handled by this work along
   with scaling performance using the developed Kernelized Robust Scaler
   (KRS). Using the developed Random Over Sample-Based Density-Based
   Spatial Clustering Associated with Noise (ROS-DBSCAN), the imbalanced
   and overlapped data were handled, which was followed by the relevant
   feature selection of data utilizing the Sine Cosine-Based Artificial
   Jellyfish Search Optimization (SC-AJSO) technique. The data were split
   under the provision of Stratified K-Fold cross-validation along being
   trained in the proposed HT-RLSTM. The experimental analysis depicted
   that better accuracy was attained in detecting attacks by the proposed
   work for different datasets. When analogized with prevailing
   state-of-the-art methods, a low false detection rate, as well as
   computation time, was attained by the proposed scheme.},

Abstract = {Orbital angular momentum (OAM), a new dimension of photons, has
   potentials in lots of domains as high-dimensional data coding/decoding.
   Here we experimentally demonstrate a free-space data transmission system
   based on 8 bits multi-state OAM shift keying, where multiplexed optical
   vortices containing 8 various OAM states are employed to constitute 8
   bits binary symbols. In the transmitter, the data coding of OAM shift
   keying is realized by switching a series of special-designed holograms.
   And in the receiver, the decoding is done by a single Dammann vortex
   grating along with image processing. We experimentally transmit data,
   including a gray-scale image, in free-space for 10 meters, showing zero
   bit-error-rate. The demonstrated results indicate a wide prospect for
   the future high-dimensional large data rate optical security

Abstract = {Systems are ideally and rapidly evolving with the development of the
   Internet and modern web technologies. Example, Ecological monitoring
   information system has become very important in determining its
   superiority as a system, so it should be tested. This article describes
   how to benchmark a system by creating a state change graph to simulate
   different intuitions on the part of each subsystem, and then comparing
   the graph to Petri net modeling based on Functioning table (PNMFT). Test
   cases can be prepared based on the accessibility of trees based on
   comparable PNMFTs. The existing fact-testing strategy for comprehensive
   testing of the system will be further generalized to improve the
   consistent quality of the remaining tests. After that, talk about
   algorithmic analysis of the system is an important for information
   security issue. The initial stage of ongoing research to improve the
   reliability of algorithmic analysis of algorithmic formalization of web
   systems is described. It may also be advisable to include a set of
   dynamic coverage criteria for web systems defined for the statistical
   testing approach used through algorithmic analysis to improve testing
   quality and algorithmic formalization of the web system through
   algorithmic analysis.},

Title = {Security Analysis of a Digital Twin Framework Using Probabilistic Model
   Checking},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {26358-26374},
Abstract = {Digital Twins (DTs) have been gaining popularity in various
   applications, such as smart manufacturing, smart energy, smart mobility,
   and smart healthcare. In simple terms, DT is described as a virtual
   replica of a given physical product, system, or process. It consists of
   three major segments: the physical entity, its virtual counterpart, and
   the connections between them. While the data is collected from a
   physical entity, processed at the virtual layer, and accessed in the
   form of a DT at the application layer, it is exposed to several security
   risks. To ensure the applicability of a DT system, it is imperative to
   understand these security risks and their implications. However, there
   is a lack of a framework that can be used to assess the security of a
   DT. This paper presents a framework in which the security of a DT can be
   analyzed with the help of a formal verification technique. The framework
   captures the defense of the system at different layers and considers
   various attacks at each layer. The security of the DT system is
   represented as a state-transition system and the security properties are
   captured in temporal logic. Probabilistic model checking (PMC) is used
   to verify the systems against these properties. In particular, the
   framework is used to analyze the probability of success and the cost of
   various potential attacks that can occur at each layer in a DT system.
   The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated with the
   help of a detailed case study in the healthcare domain.},

Title = {Evaluation of bi-directional cascading failure propagation in integrated
   electricity-natural gas system},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {121},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper aims at evaluating the bi-directional cascading failure
   propagation in integrated electricity-natural gas system (IEGS), with
   energy coupling components such as gas-fired generators and
   electricity-driven gas compressors. An integrated simulation approach is
   proposed to describe cascading failure propagation resulting from
   various triggering events, in which steady-state power flow, dynamic gas
   transmission, and working mode switching of gas compressors are
   considered. Electricity network islanding, re-dispatching of electricity
   generation and gas source pressure, as well as electricity and gas load
   shedding simulate the consequence of interactive cascading failure
   propagation. When a new steady state of IEGS is reached after the
   occurrence of an initial failure in either electricity or gas
   sub-system, the statistical indices with respect to energy supply
   availability of IEGS are calculated to assess risks caused by the
   cascading failure, and significances of individual electricity branches
   and gas pipelines are evaluated. An IEGS, consisting of a 24-bus
   35-branch electricity grid and a 28-node 25-branch gas network coupled
   by two electricity-driven gas compressors and three gas-fired
   generators, is established to validate the proposed approach. Numerical
   simulations illustrate distinct characteristics of electricity and gas
   sub-systems in the cascading failure propagation process as well as
   different impacts of each sub-system on the other.},

Abstract = {In broadcast encryption schemes, a distribution center broadcasts an
   encrypted message to a subset chosen from a universe of receivers, and
   only the intended users are able to decrypt the message. Most broadcast
   encryption schemes do not provide anonymity, and the identities of
   target receivers are sent in plaintext. However, in several
   applications, the authorized user's identities have the same sensitivity
   as the broadcasted messages. Yu, Ren, and Lou (YRL) {[}Yu, S., Ren, K.,
   and Lou, W. ``Attribute-based on-demand multicast group setup with
   membership anonymity{''}, Computer Networks, 54(3), pp. 377-386 (2010).]
   considered this issue and introduced an efficient anonymous
   attribute-based broadcast encryption scheme. This paper first proposed
   an attack on the YRL scheme, and showed that the unauthorized receivers
   could also decrypt the broadcasted message. Next, we proposed the
   Improved-YRL scheme and proved that it achieved anonymity and semantic
   security under adaptive corruptions in the chosen ciphertext setting.
   The proof is provided by the dual system encryption technique and is
   based on three complexity assumptions in composite order bilinear maps.
   The Improved-YRL scheme is a step forward in solving the long-standing
   problem of secure and low overhead anonymous broadcast encryption. (C)

Title = {Automatic underground space security monitoring based on BIM},
Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},

Volume = {157},

Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Traditional underground space safety monitoring is ineffective as data
   continuity is weak, systematic and random errors are prominent, data
   quantification is difficult, data stability is scarce (especially in bad
   weather), and it is difficult to guarantee human safety. In this study,
   BIM technology and multi-data wireless sensor network transmission
   protocol, cloud computing platform are introduced into engineering
   monitoring, real-time online monitoring equipment, cloud computing
   platform and other hardware and software are developed, and
   corresponding online monitoring system for structural safety is
   developed to realize online monitoring and early diagnosis of
   underground space safety. First, the shape of the underground space, the
   surrounding environment, and various monitoring points are modeled using
   BIM. Then, the monitoring data collected from sensors at the engineering
   site are transmitted to the cloud via wireless transmission. Data
   information management is then realized via cloud computing, and an
   actual state-change trend and security assessment is provided. Finally,
   4D technology (i.e., 3D model + time axis) that leverages a deformation
   chromatographic nephogram is used to facilitate managers to view
   deformation and safety of their underground spaces. To overcome past
   shortcomings, this system supports the management of basic engineering
   project data and storage of historical data. Furthermore, the system
   continuously reflects the fine response of each monitoring item under
   various working conditions all day, which has significant theoretical
   value and application.},

Abstract = {Security evaluation is becoming a major concern in the real time
   operation of modern power systems which are large and complex. Neural
   Networks have shown great promise as a means of predicting security of
   large power systems. But because of their black box type nature, neural
   network based security classifiers are not able to provide information
   about preventive control if required following a contingency. The
   Decision Tree based classifiers, on the other hand, are known for their
   interpretability and therefore can be used to design preventive control
   strategy. However, the DT approach suffers from the drawback that as the
   size of power system grows; the complexity of DT classifier becomes
   high. Building of complex DT classifier requires a prohibitively large
   learning set unless some compromise is made on the accuracy.
   This paper presents a hybrid approach for on-line security evaluation
   and preventive control of power Systems, which combines ANN and DT
   approaches to exploit their potential while suppressing their drawbacks.
   It applies an ANN based classifier for security evaluation of power
   systems. If an operating state of power system is found to be insecure a
   DT classifier is applied to infer preventive control measures. The
   accuracy of the DT classifier does not significantly affect the overall
   performance of this approach. The method has been applied on an IEEE
   power system and the results obtained are promising.},

Abstract = {From a view point of information security, researches on an encrypted
   search system have been done intensively. Such search systems are called
   searchable symmetric encryption (SSE). The main part of SSE is an
   encrypted index which affects security and efficiency. Until now many
   SSE schemes have been proposed, but most of them uses a random oracle to
   achieve both adaptive security and an optimal index size. The index size
   of adaptively secure SSE schemes without a random oracle can be much
   larger. In this paper, we propose a new SSE scheme which satisfies
   adaptive security in the standard model and has an optimal index size.
   Furthermore the index of our scheme consists of Bloom filters and simple
   arrays, that is, arrays of integers. Since Bloom filters are also
   implemented by an array of integers, the structure of the index is
   simple. Thus, unlike other SSE schemes with an optimal index size, the
   size does not depend on a security parameter.},

Abstract = {Access control system is often described as a state transition system.
   Given a set of access control policies, a general safety requirement in
   such a system is to determine whether a desirable property is satisfied
   in all the reachable states. In this paper, we propose to use security
   analysis techniques to maintain desirable security properties in the
   Multi-domain Environment based on risk model (MDR(2)BAC). We give a
   precise definition of security analysis problems in MDR(2)BAC, which is
   more general than safety analysis that is studied in single-domain. We
   show the process of dynamic permission adjustment in multi-domain
   environment, and illustrate two classes of problems in the process which
   can be reduced to similar analysis in the RT{[}<-,boolean AND]
   role-based trust-management language, thereby establishing an
   interesting relationship between MDR(2)BAC and the RT framework. The
   reduction gives efficient algorithms for answering most kinds of queries
   in the two stages of dynamic adjustment permissions.},

Abstract = {Spin-1 systems, in comparison to spin-1/2 systems, offer a better
   security for encoding and transferring quantum information, primarily
   due to their larger Hilbert spaces. Superconducting artificial atoms
   possess multiple energy levels, thereby being capable of emulating
   higher-spin systems. Here I consider a one-dimensional lattice of
   nearest-neighbor-coupled superconducting transmon systems, and devise a
   scheme to transfer an arbitrary qutrit state (a state encoded in a
   three-level quantum system) across the chain. I assume adjustable
   couplings between adjacent transmons, derive an analytic constraint for
   the control pulse, and show how to satisfy the constraint to achieve a
   high-fidelity state transfer under current experimental conditions. My
   protocol thus enables enhanced quantum communication and information
   processing with promising superconducting qutrits.},

Abstract = {Revocable identity-based encryption (RIBE) is an extension of IBE with
   an efficient key revocation mechanism. Revocable hierarchical IBE
   (RHIBE) is its further extension with key delegation functionality.
   Although there are various adaptively secure pairing-based RIBE schemes,
   all known hierarchical analogues only satisfy selective security. In
   addition, the currently known most efficient adaptively secure RIBE and
   selectively secure RHIBE schemes rely on non-standard assumptions, which
   are referred to as the augmented DDH assumption and q-type assumptions,
   respectively. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective design
   methodology for RHIBE schemes. We provide a generic design framework for
   RHIBE based on an HIBE scheme with a few properties. Fortunately,
   several state-of-the-art pairing-based HIBE schemes have the properties.
   In addition, our construction preserves the sizes of master public keys,
   ciphertexts, and decryption keys, as well as the complexity assumptions
   of the underlying HIBE scheme. Thus, we obtain the first RHIBE schemes
   with adaptive security under the standard k-linear assumption. We prove
   adaptive security by developing a new proof technique for RHIBE. Due to
   the compactness-preserving construction, the proposed R(H)IBE schemes
   have similar efficiencies to the most efficient existing schemes.},

   shown to be either insecure or bounded where they have to fix the
   maximum hierarchical depth of RHIBE at setup. In this paper, we propose
   a new unbounded RHIBE scheme with decryption key exposure resilience and
   with short public system parameters, and prove our RHIBE scheme to be
   adaptively secure. Our system model is scalable inherently to
   accommodate more levels of user adaptively with no adding workload or
   restarting the system. By carefully designing the hybrid games, we
   overcome the subtle obstacle in applying the dual system encryption
   methodology for the unbounded and revocable HIBE. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first construction of adaptively secure unbounded
   RHIBE scheme.},

Abstract = {With increasing exposure to software-based sensing and control,
   Photovoltaic (PV) systems are facing higher risks of cyber attacks. To
   ensure the system stability and minimize potential economic losses, it
   is imperative to monitor operating states and detect attacks at the
   early stage. To meet this demand, Micro-Phasor Measurement Units (mu
   PMU) are increasingly popular in monitoring distribution networks.
   However, due to the relatively low sampling rate, mu PMU has not yet
   been used to detect and classify cyber-attacks in power electronics
   enabled smart grid. To our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts
   to use mu PMU to detect cyber attacks that degrade the performance of
   power electronics systems. We propose to apply data-driven methods on
   micro-PMU data to implement attack detection. We have evaluated
   data-driven methods, including decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor
   (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN),
   long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN).
   The proposed CNN model achieves the required performances with the
   highest 99.23\% accuracy and 0.9963 F-1 score.},

Abstract = {Muti-modal biometric recognition systems have attracted the attention of
   many researchers in today's modern world. These systems have greater
   advantages over traditional systems that are difficult to break and
   provide good anti-spoofing abilities. Use of these systems has increased
   in recent years owing to the increasing trend of thefts, breaking of
   security systems, hacking and another means of unauthorized access. In
   this paper a multimodal recognition algorithm using palm print and palm
   vein images. The palm print image is rich in line features as it
   consists of wrinkles, ridges and principal lines. On the other hand the
   palm vein image contains rich texture features in the form of blood
   vessel patterns also called as vein patterns. A multimodal
   identification system has been proposed in this paper which uses
   Contourlet transform to analyze the features present in palm print and
   palm vein images. The proposed algorithm captures local minutae and a
   global feature from a palm print and palm vein images and stores them as
   a compact code. After extraction of the ROI from the source images the
   (2-D) image spectrum is divided into fine sub-components (called
   subbands) using iterated directional filter bank structure. The feature
   matching technique is then performed using Euclidean Distance algorithm.
   For this algorithm CASIA Palm print Database V1.0 is used.},

Volume = {7},

Pages = {671-683},
Abstract = {As part of the integrated ECOOP (European Coastal Sea Operational
   observing and Forecasting System) project, HCMR upgraded the already
   existing standalone Oil Spill Forecasting System for the Aegean Sea,
   initially developed for the Greek Operational Oceanography System
   (POSEIDON), into an active element of the European Decision Support
   System (EuroDeSS). The system is accessible through a user friendly web
   interface where the case scenarios can be fed into the oil spill drift
   model component, while the synthetic output contains detailed
   information about the distribution of oil spill particles and the oil
   spill budget and it is provided both in text based ECOOP common output
   format and as a series of sequential graphics. The main development
   steps that were necessary for this transition were the modification of
   the forcing input data module in order to allow the import of other
   system products which are usually provided in standard formats such as
   NetCDF and the transformation of the model's calculation routines to
   allow use of current, density and diffusivities data in z instead of
   sigma coordinates. During the implementation of the Aegean DeSS, the
   system was used in operational mode in order to support the Greek marine
   authorities in handling a real accident that took place in North Aegean
   area. Furthermore, the introduction of common input and output files by
   all the partners of EuroDeSS extended the system's interoperability thus
   facilitating data exchanges and comparison experiments.},

Abstract = {The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has been used widely for Voice
   over IP (VoIP) service because of its potential advantages, economical
   efficiency and call setup simplicity. However, SIP-based VoIP service
   basically has two main security issues, malformed SIP message attack and
   SIP flooding attack. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for
   SIP-based VoIP system utilizing rule matching algorithm and state
   transition models. It detects not only two main attacks, but also covers
   more SIP attacks. Instead of simply combining rule comparison and
   counting number of SIP messages, we develop secure RFC 3261 rules based
   on existing RFC 3261 rules, so that proposed mechanism shows 26\% higher
   detection rate for malformed attack. Moreover, we utilize session
   information and define the features of each state in order to detect
   abnormal situations including SIP flooding. As the result, it is shown
   that the proposed mechanism provides not only higher accuracy, but also
   covering more SIP attacks including two main attacks.},

Abstract = {This paper explains various security issues in the existing home
   automation systems and proposes the use of logic-based security
   algorithms to improve home security. This paper classifies natural
   access points to a home as primary and secondary access points depending
   on their use. Logic-based sensing is implemented by identifying normal
   user behavior at these access points and requesting user verification
   when necessary. User position is also considered when various access
   points changed states. Moreover, the algorithm also verifies the
   legitimacy of a fire alarm by measuring the change in temperature,
   humidity, and carbon monoxide levels, thus defending against
   manipulative attackers. The experiment conducted in this paper used a
   combination of sensors, microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi and ZigBee
   communication to identify user behavior at various access points and
   implement the logical sensing algorithm. In the experiment, the proposed
   logical sensing algorithm was successfully implemented for a month in a
   studio apartment. During the course of the experiment, the algorithm was
   able to detect all the state changes of the primary and secondary access
   points and also successfully verified user identity 55 times generating
   14 warnings and 5 alarms.},

Abstract = {An access control system is often viewed as a state transition system.
   Given a set of access control policies, a general safety requirement in
   such a system is to determine whether a desirable property is satisfied
   in all the reachable states. Such an analysis calls for formal
   verification. While formal analysis on traditional RBAC has been done to
   some extent, the extensions of RBAC lack such an analysis. In this
   paper, we propose a formal technique to perform security analysis on the
   Generalized Temporal RBAC (GTRBAC) model which can be used to express a
   wide range of temporal constraints on different RBAC components like
   role, user and permission. In the proposed approach, at first the GTRBAC
   system is mapped to a state transition system built using timed
   automata. Characteristics of each role, user and permission are captured
   with the help of timed automata. A single global clock is used to
   express the various temporal constraints supported in a GTRBAC model.
   Next, a set of safety and liveness properties is specified using
   computation tree logic (CTL). Model checking based formal verification
   is then done to verify the properties against the model to determine if
   the system is secure with respect to a given set of access control
   policies. Both time and space analysis has been done for studying the
   performance of the approach under different configurations.},

   post-quantum secure hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE)
   system. But in the existing works, there are many shortcomings such as
   large public/private key space and weak security model. To overcome
   these shortcomings, a method for delegating a short lattice basis is
   discussed in this paper. It maintains the lattice dimension is constant.
   This distinct feature is used to construct the secure HIBE. The issued
   scheme has many advantages over the available, such as short
   public/private keys, achieving adaptive security. It is fair that our
   scheme is the first one which achieves both constant size private key
   space and adaptive security. In addition, we also convert our scheme
   from an one-bit version to an N-bit version. Based learning with errors
   (LWE) problem, we prove the security in the standard model.},

Title = {PDE based scheme for multi-modal medical image watermarking},
Journal = {BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {Background: This work deals with copyright protection of digital images,
   an issue that needs protection of intellectual property rights. It is an
   important issue with a large number of medical images interchanged on
   the Internet every day. So, it is a challenging task to ensure the
   integrity of received images as well as authenticity. Digital
   watermarking techniques have been proposed as valid solution for this
   problem.
   Methods: It is worth mentioning that the Region Of Interest (ROI)/Region
   Of Non Interest (RONI) selection can be seen as a significant limitation
   from which suffers most of ROI/RONI based watermarking schemes and that
   in turn affects and limit their applicability in an effective way.
   Generally, the ROI/RONI is defined by a radiologist or a computer-aided
   selection tool. And thus, this will not be efficient for an institute or
   health care system, where one has to process a large number of images.
   Therefore, developing an automatic ROI/RONI selection is a challenge
   task. The major aim of this work is to develop an automatic selection
   algorithm of embedding region based on the so called Partial
   Differential Equation (PDE) method. Thus avoiding ROI/RONI selection
   problems including: (1) computational overhead, (2) time consuming, and
   (3) modality dependent selection.
   Results: The algorithm is evaluated in terms of imperceptibility,
   robustness, tamper localization and recovery using MRI, Ultrasound, CT
   and X-ray grey scale medical images. From experimental results that we
   have conducted on a database of 100 medical images of four modalities,
   it can be inferred that our method can achieve high imperceptibility,
   while showing good robustness against attacks. Furthermore, the
   experiment results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
   in detecting and recovering the various types of tampering. The highest
   PSNR value reached over the 100 images is 94,746 dB, while the lowest
   PSNR value is 60,1272 dB, which demonstrates the higher imperceptibility
   nature of the proposed method. Moreover, the Normalized Correlation (NC)
   between the original watermark and the corresponding extracted watermark
   for 100 images is computed. We get a NC value greater than or equal to
   0.998. This indicates that the extracted watermark is very similar to
   the original watermark for all modalities.
   Conclusion: The key features of our proposed method are to (1) increase
   the robustness of the watermark against attacks; (2) provide more
   transparency to the embedded watermark. (3) provide more authenticity
   and integrity protection of the content of medical images. (4) provide
   minimum ROI/RONI selection complexity.},

Abstract = {We describe the specification of the formal security policy model and
   formal top-level specification for the Least Privilege Separation Kernel
   (LPSK) in Alloy, a relatively new modeling language and analysis tool.
   The state of the art for the formal verification of secure software
   requires representation of an abstract model, and one or more
   refinements (to the model), in a formal specification language. These
   specifications are then examined for self-consistency with their
   properties, as well as for consistency between levels of abstraction,
   all of which can be time consuming, and costly. Alloy provides a simple,
   intuitive logic framework, in contrast to many other formal languages
   that are intended to support general-purpose mathematics. In order to
   determine whether Alloy can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
   the verification of secure computer systems, we used it to specify
   portions of the LPSK formal security policy model and formal top-level
   specification, and utilized the Alloy Analyzer to examine the
   consistency of the specifications. The security-critical system elements
   and predicates for security properties were defined in terms of a state
   model, and system operations were represented as state transitions.
   While Alloy does not support induction or proofs, it can be used to find
   counter examples in a small scope of state transitions. We conclude that
   Alloy has few limitations and is suitable, as measured by utility and
   ease of use, to include in the toolbox for rapid high-assurance system
   development. The primary concern with using Alloy for industrial, versus
   academic, security verification is the scalability of the Alloy Analyzer
   with respect to the state-space of the security model and formal
   top-level specification. For real system verification, Alloy must
   support a much larger scope. We found that the translation of an
   existing informal LPSK security policy model to Alloy provided insight
   for making the model clearer. It is also apparent that Alloy allows for
   the beginner to formal system verification to quickly climb its learning
   curve.},

Abstract = {Security evaluation is becoming a major concern in the real time
   operation of modern power systems which are large and complex. Neural
   Networks have shown great promise as a means of predicting security of
   large power systems. But because of their black box type nature, neural
   network based security classifiers are not able to provide information
   about preventive control if required following a contingency. The
   Decision Tree based classifiers, on the other hand, are known for their
   interpretability and therefore can be used to design preventive control
   strategy. However, the DT approach suffers from the drawback that as the
   size of power systems grows, the complexity of DT classifier becomes
   high. Building of complex DT classifier requires a prohibitively large
   learning set unless some compromise is made on the accuracy.
   This paper presents a hybrid approach for on-line security evaluation
   and preventive control of power systems, which combines ANN and DT
   approaches to exploit their potential while suppressing their drawbacks.
   It applies an ANN based classifier for security evaluation of power
   systems. If an operating state of power system is found to be insecure,
   a DT classifier is applied to infer preventive control measures, The
   accuracy of the DT classifier does not significantly affect the overall
   performance of this approach The method has been applied on an IEEE
   power system and the results obtained are promising.},

Journal = {RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY},
Year = {2020},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Cybersecurity has drawn increasing attention in the nuclear industry. To
   improve the cyber-security posture, it is important to develop effective
   methods for cyber-attack response and cyber-security risk assessment. In
   this research, we develop a finite-horizon semi-Markov general-sum game
   between the defender (i.e., plant operator) and the attacker to obtain
   the time-sensitive attack response strategy and the real-time risk
   assessment in nuclear power plants. We propose methods for identifying
   system states of concern to reduce the state space and for determining
   state transition probabilities by integrating probabilistic risk
   assessment techniques. After a proper discretization of the developed
   continuous-time model, we use dynamic programming to derive the
   time-varying and state-dependent strategy of the defender based on the
   solution concept of the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. For risk
   assessment, three risk metrics are considered, and an exact analytical
   algorithm and a Monte Carlo simulation-based algorithm for obtaining the
   metrics are developed. Both players' strategies and the risk metrics are
   illustrated using a digital feedwater control system used in pressurized
   water reactors. The results show that the proposed method can support
   plant operators in timely cyber-attack response and effective risk
   assessment, reduce the risk, and improve the resilience of nuclear power
   plants to malicious cyber-attacks.},

Abstract = {Cloud storage brings strong conveniences for flexible data sharing. When
   sharing data with a large number of entities described with fuzzy
   identities, the data owners must leverage a suitable encryption scheme
   to meet the security and efficiency requirements. (hierarchical)
   Identity-based encryption is a promising candidate to ensure
   fuzzy-entity data sharing while meeting the security requirement, but
   encounters the efficiency difficulty in multireceiver settings. We
   introduce the notion of subtree-based encryption (SBE) to support
   multireceiver data sharing mechanism in large-scale enterprises. Users
   in SBE are organized in a tree structure. Superior users can generate
   the secret keys to their subordinates. Unlike HIBE merely allowing a
   single decryption path, SBE enables encryption for a subset of users. We
   define the security notion for SBE, namely Ciphertext
   Indistinguishability against Adaptively Chosen-Sub-Tree and
   Chosen-Ciphertext Attack (IND-CST-CCA2). We propose two secure SBE
   schemes (SBEs). We first propose a basic SBEs against Adaptively
   Chosen-Sub-Tree and Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-CST-CPA), in which we
   do not allow the attacker to get decryption results from other users in
   the security game. We then propose a CCA2-secure SBEs from the basic
   scheme without requiring any other cryptographic primitives. Our
   CCA2-secure scheme natively allows public ciphertext validity test,
   which is a useful property when a CCA2-secure SBEs is used to design
   advanced protocols and auditing mechanisms for fuzzy-entity data
   sharing.},

Abstract = {In terms of the accumulation of historical data of the power system,
   China's power grids have accumulated a great number of dispatching and
   operating data which contains different voltage levels. Online safety
   and stability analysis conduct a comprehensive system assessment every
   15 minutes, including power flow, short circuit, static safety analysis,
   voltage stability, transient stability, small disturbance stability,
   limit transmission power, and scheduling assistance decision-making, and
   the calculation data and result data are about 1G. Based on the
   six-month online historical data accumulated by a provincial power grid,
   this paper studies the characteristics of the actual power grid security
   and stability, and proposes a system stability analysis method based on
   the online security analysis of historical resources. At the same time,
   Considering the time-varying characteristics of the power system, an
   operation rule extracting method was proposed. Firstly, based on the
   correlation analysis methods, the corresponding features are selected
   for each type on the hierarchical grid. Then, a power grid security risk
   assessment system is established based on load ratio, and line
   limitation. Finally, this article automatically discovers the
   characteristics and rules of grid dispatching operations from numerous
   online data, provides a theoretical basis for operational mode and
   scheduling decisions, further improves the ability of large-scale grid
   dispatching and online safety analysis, and enhances the ability of
   power grids to resist the influence of external factors on safe and
   stable operations ability and has important practical application value.},

Abstract = {The concept of algebraic state machine has been introduced in {[}3] as a
   state transition system the states of which are each defined as an
   algebra, and that communicate through channels.
   To make efficient use of this concept, one needs a formal semantics, as
   well as notions of composition and refinement, which are provided in the
   present work. To demonstrate their usefulness for an application area of
   major interest, we show how to extend algebraic state machines with data
   types modelling cryptographic operations and with an adversary model to
   reason about security-critical systems. As an example we consider a
   cryptographic protocol proposed in the literature.},

Abstract = {Design of a serial fusion based multi-biometric verification system
   requires fixing several parameters, such as reject thresholds at each
   stage of the architecture and the order in which each individual
   verifier is placed within the multi-stage system. Selecting the order of
   verifier is a crucial parameter to fix because of its high impact on
   verification errors. A wrong choice of verifier order might lead to
   tremendous user inconvenience by denying a large number of genuine users
   and might cause severe security breach by accepting impostors
   frequently. Unfortunately, this design issue has been poorly
   investigated in multi-biometric literature. In this paper, we address
   this design issue by performing experiments using three different serial
   fusion based multi-biometric verification schemes. We did our
   experiments on publicly available NIST multi-modal dataset. We tested 24
   orders-all possible orders originated from four individual verifiers-on
   a four-stage biometric verification system. Our experimental results
   show that the verifier order ``best-to-worst{''}, where the best
   performing individual verifier is placed in the first stage, the next
   best performing individual verifier is placed in the second stage, and
   so on, is the top performing order. In addition, we have proposed a
   modification to the traditional architecture of serial fusion based
   multi-biometric verification systems. With rigorous experiments on the
   NIST multi-modal dataset and using three serial fusion based
   multi-biometric verification schemes, we demonstrated that our proposed
   architecture significantly improves the performance of serial fusion
   based multi-biometric verification systems.},

Abstract = {Public cultural sharing service plays an important role in the public
   cultural platform. The recommender systems can bring users useful
   cultural resources and information. For safety and security reasons of
   the cultural resources, the external applications are not allowed to
   directly access the original resource data stored in the cultural
   databases by sending recommendation requests. The cultural recommender
   system needs a way to isolate the cultural resources from the outside
   while keeping the recommendation services. To address this issue, this
   paper proposes Representational State Transfer (REST)-based architecture
   of the cultural recommender system that can provide loosely coupled
   structures for system modules while maintaining the security access of

Abstract = {A technique which depends on the application of the neural network for
   the steady state security assessment is suggested in this paper. The
   paper gives high accuracy security classification without the need for a
   very big size training set. The problem has been solved in two stages.
   In the first stage an approximate classifier is to be found
   corresponding to a reasonable number of operating states. The neural
   network used in this stage has no hidden layers,as only approximate
   classifier is needed, which reduces the training procedure effort. In
   the second stage a training set is then to be generated in the space
   around this approximate classifier using an appropriate step by step
   mathematical technique. A multilayer neural network is then to be
   trained by this new training set to get a high accuracy classifier.
   A corrective action is also suggested. When insecure case is detected,in
   the real life operation, corrective action must take place to take the
   system from the insecure to the secure state. This call be done by using
   the approximate classifier expression and the power balance equation at
   first to move the insecure operating point to the secure region. The new
   operating point is then to be checked using the high accuracy
   classifier, if found insecure it can be easily moved to a new point and
   then rechecked until the point attains the security state. The suggested
   technique has been tested on a sample power system and gave very
   satisfactory results.},

Abstract = {A layered management and hybrid control strategy based on hybrid
   automata and random forest for the microgrid is proposed in this study.
   It is used to realise energy management and multi-modal coordinated
   switching of microgrid system to ensure high security, stability and
   high efficiency. Management and control strategies are implemented
   through a three-layer microgrid architecture based on multi-agent system
   theory. An energy management strategy is designed for the microgrid
   system in the upper layer agent structure. A coordinated control
   strategy is designed in the middle layer agent structure. A local
   control strategy is designed into the bottom layer agent structure. In
   the middle layer coordinated control strategy, the hybrid automata is
   used to characterise the complex logical features of each underlying
   unit and trigger the switching of working modes according to the
   condition change. The random forest algorithm is used to analyse the
   running state and reduce the number of switching. Finally, the
   simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control
   strategy in different scenarios.},

Abstract = {In industrial plants such as nuclear power plants, system operations are
   performed by embedded controllers orchestrated by Supervisory Control
   and Data Acquisition (SCADA) software. A targeted attack (also termed a
   control aware attack) on the controller/SCADA software can lead a
   control system to operate in an unsafe mode or sometimes to complete
   shutdown of the plant. Such malware attacks can result in tremendous
   cost to the organization for recovery, cleanup, and maintenance
   activity. SCADA systems in operational mode generate huge log files.
   These files are useful in analysis of the plant behavior and diagnostics
   during an ongoing attack. However, they are bulky and difficult for
   manual inspection. Data mining techniques such as least squares
   approximation and computational methods can be used in the analysis of
   logs and to take proactive actions when required. This paper explores
   methodologies and algorithms so as to develop an effective monitoring
   scheme against control aware cyber attacks. It also explains soft
   computation techniques such as the computational geometric method and
   least squares approximation that can be effective in monitor design.
   This paper provides insights into diagnostic monitoring of its
   effectiveness by attack simulations on a four-tank model and using
   computation techniques to diagnose it. Cyber security of instrumentation
   and control systems used in nuclear power plants is of paramount
   importance and hence could be a possible target of such applications.

Abstract = {Consensus algorithms in distributed systems have attracted much
   attention in recent studies. However, there is a need for a
   classification that leads to better understanding and helps direct the
   deployment of such algorithms. In this paper, we classify common
   consensus algorithms based on how they decide the order of system state
   changes. We then determine the extent to which each category prioritizes
   scalability, decentralization, and security. As with other engineering
   design scenarios, this is a choose-two tradeoff. Our key contribution is
   that, based on this taxonomy of tradeoffs, we are able to discern the
   types of consensus algorithms that work well within the application
   area(s) for a given distributed system. We find that a dichotomy of
   algorithms between leader-based and voting-based consensus algorithms
   emerges from this taxonomy. Applications of this classification scheme
   include several different categories of distributed ledgers such as
   blockchains and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).},

Journal = {COMPUTER JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUL 24},
Abstract = {The attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme is suitable for access
   control of ciphertext in cloud computing. Kowalczyk and Wee proposed an
   adaptively secure attribute encryption scheme that supports NC1
   circuits. However, the circuit depth increases because this scheme
   supports only circuits with fan-in 2, which increases the key length and
   computational complexity of the key generation and decryption
   algorithms. To improve efficiency, we designed a secret sharing scheme
   for circuits with fan-in n, and we proposed a key-policy ABE scheme that
   supports circuits with fan-in n. We also designed pebbling rules for
   secret sharing in circuits with fan-in n, improving the compactness of
   the security reduction. Finally, we proved the adaptive security of the
   scheme by using a piecewise guessing framework and dual-system
   encryption. Compared with existing schemes, our scheme reduces the key
   size, improves the efficiency of the key generation algorithm and the
   decryption algorithm and provides tighter security reduction.},

Abstract = {omposable security definitions, at times called simulation-based
   definitions, provide strong security guarantees that hold in any
   context. However, they are also met with some skepticism due to many
   impossibility results; goals such as commitments and zero-knowledge that
   are achievable in a stand-alone sense were shown to be unachievable
   composably (without a setup) since provably no efficient simulator
   exists. In particular, in the context of adaptive security, the
   so-called ``simulator commitment problem{''} arises: once a party gets
   corrupted, an efficient simulator is unable to be consistent with its
   pre-corruption outputs. A natural question is whether such impossibility
   results are unavoidable or only artifacts of frameworks being too
   restrictive.
   In this work, we propose a novel type of composable security statement
   that evades the commitment problem. Our new type is able to express the
   composable guarantees of schemes that previously did not have a clear
   composable understanding. To this end, we leverage the concept of system
   specifications in the Constructive Cryptography framework, capturing the
   conjunction of several interval-wise guarantees, each specifying the
   guarantees between two events. We develop the required theory and
   present the corresponding new composition theorem.
   We present three applications of our theory. First, we show in the
   context of symmetric encryption with adaptive corruption how our notion
   naturally captures the expected confidentiality guarantee-the messages
   remain confidential until either party gets corrupted-and that it can be
   achieved by any standard semantically secure scheme (negating the need
   for non-committing encryption). Second, we present a composable
   formalization of (so far only known to be standalone secure) commitment
   protocols, which is instantiable without a trusted setup like a CRS. We
   show it to be sufficient for being used in coin tossing over the
   telephone, one of the early intuitive applications of commitments.
   Third, we reexamine a result by Hofheinz, Matt, and Maurer
   {[}Asiacrypt'15] implying that IND-ID-CPA security is not the right
   notion for identity-based encryption, unmasking this claim as an
   unnecessary framework artifact.},

Abstract = {The emerging trend of restructuring power systems, security is becoming
   a major concern for electric utilities. The security assessment of power
   system is being considered as an important problem in planning,
   operation and control. Security assessment entails that the system
   should remain in secure operating state under abnormal conditions. In a
   power system the Security assessment is carried out by using the voltage
   performance index (VPI) following a contingency. Contingencies are
   termed as the uncertain events, occurred due to line outage in the
   system. VPI can be used for identifying the critical contingency from
   the perspective of bus voltage violation limits. Flexible Alternating
   Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) devices are having a great impact
   on the performance of the transmission network. FACTS devices are used
   for controlling real and reactive power flows and regulating the bus
   voltages in power systems. Also, FACTS devices raises power transfer
   capability reduces system losses and improves system stability, because
   of their fast and flexible control characteristics. Owing to their huge
   capital cost, it is essential to place these devices optimally in a
   power system. In this paper, Differential Evolution (DE), a population
   based stochastic meta-heuristic optimization algorithm is applied for
   optimal placement of static var compensator (SVC) aimed to the voltage
   security enhancement of a power system. The SVC placement is considered
   to be a planning problem and is formulated as a multi-criteria problem
   comprising of minimization of real power loss, voltage security and
   investment cost of SVC under single line outage contingencies.
   Effectiveness of the DE algorithm based approach has been demonstrated
   on IEEE 30-bus test system.},

Abstract = {This study is focused on a multi-agent system-based event-triggered
   hybrid control for intelligently restructuring the operating mode of an
   microgrid (MG) to ensure the energy supply with high security, stability
   and cost effectiveness. Owing to the MG is composed of different types
   of distributed energy resources, thus it is typical hybrid dynamic
   network. Considering the complex hybrid behaviours, a hierarchical
   decentralised coordinated control scheme is firstly constructed based on
   multi-agent system, then, the hybrid model of the MG is built by using
   differential hybrid Petri nets. Based on the hybrid models, an
   event-triggered hybrid control including three kinds of switching
   controls is constructed by designing multiple enabling functions that
   can be activated by different triggering conditions, and the interactive
   coordination among different switching controls is implemented through
   the intelligent multiple-agent system platform, so that the operating
   mode of MG can be intelligently restructured in flexible manner
   according to the changes of operating situation. The validity of
   proposed control scheme is demonstrated by means of simulation results.},

Abstract = {The paper postulates the feasibility of an open but secure and
   affordable home automation system. An Internet enabled embedded
   programmable logic controller is used in the context of intelligent
   networked Heating, Ventilation, \& Air Conditioning (HVAC)-control. In
   the paper, security problems of the ecotope, comprising embedded
   controllers, web servers, and external services are analysed. In the
   absence of encryption of the channels, an application based security
   method was designed, preventing from simple manipulation of user data.
   Integrity of the intranet is secured via rigorous design, avoiding
   inbound traffic. A simplified sequence diagram documents this primary
   protection process, using rolling code encryption of the transmitted
   data. The security method was demonstrated successfully using an IP
   enabled universal industrial controller. Apart from security, process
   capability is investigated, analysing energy supply, communication
   channel options, bandwidth and real time requirements. Finalising,
   semantic enhanced, representational state transfer (REST), and resource
   definition framework are bespoken for the context of embedded.},

Abstract = {Decision Tree approach for security assessment and evaluation is
   presented. The general decision tree methodology is proposed for die
   purpose of predicting the robustness of a power system in the occurrence
   of severe disturbances. and of discovering appropriate control actions
   whenever needed. The decision trees are built off-line and are used
   on-line. Their building calls upon an inductive inference method, which
   automatically extracts the relevant information from large bodies of
   simulation data and express in terms of the system controllable
   variables. In this paper Decision trees are used for classifying the
   operating states of the power systems as either secure/insecure using
   the MW flows and voltages and the severity level of the violation and
   the control actions necessary by finding the location of operating point
   when dropped at the top node of the decision tree.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an ontological approach to perceive the current
   security status of the network. Computer network is a dynamic entity
   whose state changes with the introduction of new services, installation
   of new network operating system, and addition of new hardware
   components, creation of new user roles and by attacks from various
   actors instigated by aggressors. Various security mechanisms employed in
   the network does not give the complete picture of security of complete
   network. In this paper we have proposed taxonomy and ontology which may
   be used to infer impact of various events happening in the network on
   security status of the network. Vulnerability, Network and Attack are
   the main taxonomy classes in the ontology. Vulnerability class describes
   various types of vulnerabilities in the network which may in hardware
   components like storage devices, computing devices or networks devices.
   Attack class has many subclasses like Actor class which is entity
   executing the attack, Goal class describes goal of the attack, Attack
   mechanism class defines attack methodology, Scope class describes size
   and utility of the target, Automation level describes the automation
   level of the attack Evaluation of security status of the network is
   required for network security situational awareness. Network class has
   network operating system, users, roles, hardware components and services
   as its subclasses. Based on this taxonomy ontology has been developed to
   perceive network security status. Finally a framework, which uses this
   ontology as knowledgebase has been proposed.},

Title = {Multi-modal Biometrics Based Implicit Driver Identification System Using
   Multi-TF Images of ECG and EMG},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {159},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As security is emphasized inside and outside the vehicle, research on
   driver identification technology using bio-signals is being actively
   studied. The bio-signals acquired by the behavioral characteristics of
   the driver include artifacts generated according to the driving
   environment, which could potentially degrade the accuracy of the
   identification system. Existing driver identification systems either
   remove the normalization process of bio-signals in the preprocessing
   stage or use artifacts included in a single bio-signals, resulting in
   low identification accuracy. To solve these problems in a real
   situation, we propose a driver identification system that converts ECG
   and EMG signals obtained from different driving conditions into 2D
   spectrograms through multi-TF image and uses multi-stream CNN. The
   proposed system consists of a preprocessing phase of ECG and EMG
   signals, a multi-TF image conversion process, and a driver
   identification stage using a multi-stream-based CNN. Under all driving
   conditions, the driver identification system reached an average accuracy
   of 96.8\% and an F1 score of 0.973, which overperformed the existing
   driver identification systems by more than 1\%.},

Abstract = {Enhancement of an individual's security and protection is the major
   concern in the current era. Biometric security becomes a positive
   solution, adopted for many identification problems in various sectors,
   including Aviation. As the avionics business keeps growing worldwide,
   air terminals face the difficulties of increasingly more passenger
   volumes; with that, travelers' desire for a secure and consistent pass
   through the airport terminals is just expanding. COVID-19 has managed a
   hit in all parts of our lives. Maintaining social distance and wearing
   masks are very important in maintaining a person's health in this
   pandemic situation. In this scenario, facial recognition for passenger
   identification is difficult and tends to false acceptance of passengers
   with identical faces.
   To address this issue, contactless biometric traits like iris and
   fingerprints are considered for security growth. The paper deals with
   the fusion of iris and fingerprint to identify passengers without
   removing the masks and promotes safe travel. The iris and fingerprint
   features are extracted using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM) and
   cross number technique. Maintaining these templates requires more space
   for storage. To make this simple, Sparse autoencoder, an unsupervised
   deep learning technique is incorporated on the fused template for
   attaining the dimensionality reduction. A minimum cost matcher(MCM) is
   employed to increase the multimodal biometric system's accuracy and
   performance. Thus, the proposed system honors passenger security builds
   confidence in air travel, and also strives for economic growth.},

   events is a formal method to describe the protocol state transition and
   algorithm in concurrent and distributed systems, which can be used to
   prove the security of network protocols. Based on logic of events, we
   propose migration rule and derive inheritability to reduce redundancy
   and complexity of protocol analysis procedure, and improve efficiency of
   protocol analysis. We study the KerNeeS protocol which providing mutual

Title = {A Robust RF Fingerprinting Approach Using Multisampling Convolutional
   Neural Network},

Abstract = {With the increasing popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT), device
   identification, and authentication has become a critical security issue.
   Recently, radio frequency (RF) fingerprint-based identification schemes
   have attracted wide attention as they extract the inherent
   characteristics of hardware circuits which is very hard to forge.
   However, existing RF fingerprint-based approaches face the problems of
   unstable region of interest (ROI), high-cost feature design, and
   incomplete automation. To address these problems, this paper proposes a
   multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract RF
   fingerprint from the selected ROI for classifying ZigBee devices. A
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptive ROI selection algorithm is also
   developed to alleviate the effect of semi-steady behavior of ZigBee
   devices owing to sleep mode switching. The proposed MSCNN uses multiple
   downsampling transformations for multiscale feature extraction and
   classification automatically. To validate and evaluate the performance
   of our proposed method, we design a testbed consisting of one low-cost
   universal software radio peripheral (USRP) as the receiver and 54 CC2530
   devices as targets for identification. Extensive experiments are
   conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MSCNN both
   in the line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. The
   classification accuracy is as high as 97\% under the LOS scenarios
   around SNR = 30 dB. Our scheme is robust over a wide range of SNRs under
   the LOS scenarios as well as under the NLOS scenarios.},

Abstract = {We propose new constructions for identity-based broadcast encryption
   (IBBE) and fuzzy identity-based encryption (FIBE) in bilinear groups of
   composite order. Our starting point is the IBBE scheme of Delerablee
   (Asiacrypt 2007) and the FIBE scheme of Herranz et al. (PKC 2010) proven
   secure under parameterised assumptions called generalised decisional
   bilinear Diffie-Hellman (GDDHE) and augmented multi-sequence of
   exponents Diffie-Hellman (aMSE-DDH) respectively. The two schemes are
   described in the prime-order pairing group. We transform the schemes
   into the setting of (symmetric) composite-order groups and prove
   security from two static assumptions (subgroup decision).
   The Deja, Q framework of Chase et al. (Asiacrypt 2016) is known to cover
   a large class of parameterised assumptions (dubbed fiber assumption),
   that is, these assumptions, when defined in asymmetric composite order
   groups, are implied by subgroup decision assumptions in the underlying
   composite-order groups. We argue that the GDDHE and aMSEDDH assumptions
   are not covered by the Deja, Q iiber assumption framework. We therefore
   work out direct security reductions for the two schemes based on
   subgroup decision assumptions. Furthermore, our proofs involve novel
   extensions of Deja, Q techniques of Wee (TCC 2016A) and Chase et al.
   Our constructions have constant-size ciphertexts. The IBBE has
   constant-size keys as well and guarantees stronger security as compared
   to Delerablee's IBBE, thus making it the first compact IBBE known to be
   selectively secure without random oracles under simple assumptions. The
   fuzzy IBE scheme is the first to simultaneously feature constant-size
   ciphertexts and security under standard assumptions.},

Abstract = {Contingency analysis (CA) is one of the critical tools of a static
   security assessment (SSA). It is used to forecast the operating states
   of a power system under one or more outages of generators, transmission
   lines, transformers, etc. To perform SSA, repetitive load flow analyses
   are required for obtaining the bus voltages, bus injections, and line
   flows considering each possible outage. A repetitive load flow analysis
   demands huge computational efforts like efficient system modelling for
   faster load flow solutions, parallel programming and High performance
   computing (HPC). In this paper, an N-1-1 CA has been analysed using fast
   decoupled load flow (FDLF) with a strategy of screening and ranking the
   catastrophic contingencies. This paper explores a computationally
   efficient method to analyze the severity and the ranking of N-1-1
   contingencies for large power system SSA. The performance of the FDLF
   based SSA method is demonstrated on two standard IEEE 14 and 118 bus
   systems.},

Abstract = {Providing security is essential for mission critical Wireless Ad Hoc and
   Sensor Networks (WAHSN) applications. Often a highly secure mechanism
   inevitably consumes a rather large amount of system resources, which in
   turn may unintentionally cause a Security Service Denial of Service
   (SSDoS) attack. This paper proposes a self-adaptive resource-aware
   (SARA) security provisioning approach for WAHSNs. For resource scarce
   WAHSNs, SARA strives to provide the optimal tradeoff between the
   sufficient security (which is reflected by the Security Index (SI)) and
   the acceptable network performance degradation (which is reflected by
   the Performance Index (PI)). With the support of the offline optimal
   secure protocol selection module and the online self-adaptive security
   control module, SARA is capable of employing different combinations of
   secure protocol sets to satisfy different security need at different
   condition for different applications.
   To determine the security index SI of a secure protocol set, a heuristic
   cross-layer security-service mapping mechanism is presented.
   Furthermore, we evaluate performance index PI of a secure protocol set
   via simulation followed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Consequently,
   the proposed self-adaptive security provisioning based on both SI and PI
   achieves the maximum overall network security services and network
   performance services, without causing the SSDoS attack. Furthermore,
   this self-adaptive mechanism is capable of switching from one secure
   protocol set to another while keeping similar level of security and
   performance, it thus provides additional security by security service
   hopping.},

Abstract = {The increasing uncertainty that surrounds electricity system operation
   renders security assessment a highly challenging task; the range of
   possible operating states expands, rendering traditional approaches
   based on heuristic practices and ad hoc analysis obsolete. In turn,
   machine learning can be used to construct surrogate models approximating
   the system's security boundary in the region of operation. To this end,
   past system history can be useful for generating anticipated system
   states suitable for training. However, inferring the underlying data
   model, to allow high-density sampling, is problematic due to the large
   number of variables, their complex marginal probability distributions
   and the nonlinear dependence structure they exhibit. In this paper, we
   adopt the C-Vine pair-copula decomposition scheme; clustering and
   principal component transformation stages are introduced, followed by a
   truncation to the pairwise dependency modeling, enabling efficient
   fitting and sampling of large datasets. Using measurements from the
   French grid, we show that a machine learning training database sampled
   from the proposed method can produce binary security classifiers with
   superior predictive capability compared to other approaches.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 5},
Abstract = {To fully reveal the interplay of the cyber system and physical system in
   the microgrid, this paper proposes a generic hierarchical modeling
   framework for cyber-physical integration modeling of microgrid,
   including two layers: physical device layer and controller layer. Each
   layer includes two parts: the continuous part (characterizing the
   physical system in the microgrid) and the discrete part (characterizing
   the cyber system in the microgrid). In this paper, firstly, detailed
   mathematical expressions describing the dynamic characteristics of each
   layer (including continuous characteristics and discrete
   characteristics) and describing the interplay of the continuous part and
   discrete part in each layer are given, which contributes to a better
   understanding of the interplay of the information flow and energy flow
   in the microgrid. Secondly, the cyber-physical integration modeling of
   each unit in the proposed framework is established using hybrid
   automaton, which can clearly present the operation state of each unit of
   the microgrid and its state transfer process, which is beneficial to
   design the optimal operation state trajectory of the system. The
   proposed modeling framework is generic and can be extended to any
   dynamic system with cyber-physical integration. Finally, a typical
   microgrid system is taken as an example to verify the feasibility of the
   proposed modeling approach.},

Abstract = {Addressing security misconfiguration in complex distributed systems,
   such as networked Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Internet of
   Things (IoT) is challenging. Owners and operators must go beyond tuning
   parameters of individual components and consider the security
   implications of configuration changes on entire systems. Given the
   growing scale of cyber systems, this task must be highly automated.
   Unfortunately, prior work on configuration errors has largely ignored
   the security impact of configurations of connected components. To
   address this gap, we present SCIBORG, a framework that improves the
   security posture of distributed systems by examining the impact of
   configuration changes across interdependent components using a
   graph-based model of the system and its vulnerabilities. It formulates a
   Constraint Satisfaction Problem from the graph-based model and uses an
   SMT solver to find optimal configuration parameter values that minimize
   the impact of attacks while preserving system functionality. SCIBORG
   also provides supporting evidence for the proposed configuration
   changes. We evaluate SCIBORG on an IoT testbed.},

Abstract = {The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Air Navigation Service
   Providers (ANSPs) around the world are looking to share data and get
   interconnected with each other as well as data service consumers. This
   interconnectivity enables new functionality but also new attack vectors.
   Today, agencies mostly rely on commercial security solutions providing
   adequate protection for commercial data services but have deficiencies
   when it comes to the Air Traffic Management (ATM) environment with its
   requirement for highest resilience, multi-level redundancies, and
   dynamic environment.
   This paper introduces a novel approach to create an ATM-grade baseline
   integrating operational security events (OSE) and alerts (OSA) based on
   abnormal or malicious network traffic. An assured and trusted baseline
   is key to detecting atypical or malicious traffic. A testbed has been
   developed that models the regular ATM-grade IP-network behavior. The
   sample configuration uses open source stacks ElastiFlow, and SELKS to
   provide network flow data collection and visualization and demonstrate
   resilience against hacking attempts via unauthorized communication and
   protocols between nodes, unauthorized configuration changes via
   distribution of parameters to network nodes, as well as detection of
   malicious communication attempts from unauthorized devices on the
   network. A Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture is chosen as it
   features a programmable, efficient network configuration improving
   network performance and monitoring. The OpenFlow protocol is used to
   provide the control plane in the testbed. Data flows will be modeled as
   synchronous as well as asynchronous. Vulnerabilities are then
   identified, attack scenarios defined and applied to the testbed setup.
   The available SDN platform tools are then used to detect the anomalies.
   Sets of experiments are performed and the results compared and
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The Advanced Photon Source (APS) has been in operational mode for more
   than 5 yr. Currently there are over 40 beamlines in various phases of
   operation. The control system of choice at the APS is the Experimental
   Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS). We have provided various
   interfaces to the beamlines from the APS control system. An overview of
   the various systems will be discussed. The General Control System
   Information (GCSI) uses dedicated computers as EPICS process variable
   gateways to provide data from the APS control system to each beamline.
   The GCSI architecture makes the APS control system secure, yet has the
   flexibility of providing access control to any data available on the APS
   control system. In addition, the gateway reduces the load on the APS
   control system equipment by making only one connection for each process
   variable accessed by multiple users. Each sector, consisting of a
   bending magnet and insertion device beamlines, is provided its own
   gateway, which resides on the local sector network. This scheme has the
   advantage of providing network security and more reliable operation. To
   provide real-time accelerator data to beamlines, each sector has been
   provided a chassis to display the storage ring current and other
   relevant information. These data are transmitted via a direct fiber link
   from the APS control system hardware to the beamlines. The beamlines are
   also provided VME-based hardware and associated EPICS software to
   retrieve key information provided via this fiber link. Some of the
   information on this link is beam current, lifetime, injection status,
   and sector specific information such as shutter status, insertion device
   gap, and energy, and storage ring and front-end beam position monitor
   signals. The data rates on this link are typically 10 Hz but can be as
   high as 272 kHz. This scheme allows the beamlines using EPICS-based
   software to seamlessly use the data from the APS control system without
   excessively impacting the system. For high-precision x-ray timing
   experiments, a new scheme has been designed to distribute the
   radio-frequency timing signals to the beamlines. Using VME-based
   hardware and EPICS software, the bunch clock signal is generated at the
   beamline for use in timing experiments. Data are provided at the radio
   frequency of 352 MHz. Beamlines have also been provided with hardware
   and software to generate the bunch clock signal for timing experiments.

Abstract = {Security analysis is a formal verification technique to ascertain
   certain desirable guarantees on the access control policy specification.
   Given a set of access control policies, a general safety requirement in
   such a system is to determine whether a desirable property is satisfied
   in all the reachable states. Such an analysis calls for the use of
   formal verification techniques. While formal analysis on traditional
   Role Based Access Control (RBAC) has been done to some extent, recent
   extensions to RBAC lack such an analysis. In this paper, we consider the
   temporal RBAC extensions and propose a formal technique using timed
   automata to perform security analysis by analyzing both safety and
   liveness properties. Using safety properties one ensures that something
   bad never happens while liveness properties show that some good state is
   also achieved. GTRBAC is a well accepted generalized temporal RBAC model
   which can handle a wide range of temporal constraints while specifying
   different access control policies. Analysis of such a model involves a
   process of mapping a GTRBAC based system into a state transition system.
   Different reduction rules are proposed to simplify the modeling process
   depending upon the constraints supported by the system. The effect of
   different constraints on the modeling process is also studied. (C) 2010

Title = {A Systematic Analysis Method for 5G Non-Access Stratum Signalling
   Security},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {125424-125441},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a systematic analysis method for 5G Non-Access
   Stratum Signalling security based on formal analysis, which has
   identified 10 new 5G protocol vulnerabilities, and an improved PKI
   security mechanism targeted at eliminating these vulnerabilities.
   Firstly, the 5G system, state transition properties and security
   properties were abstracted from 3GPP specifications. To mimic an
   attacker's behavior, a Dolev-Yao adversary model was constructed in the
   5G model by empowering it with NAS signalling security testing knowledge
   and reasonable security capabilities in the wireless channel. Then we
   used the TAMARIN prover to verify all the abstracted properties one by
   one and discovered some protocol vulnerabilities based on the
   counterexamples found. We further verified these vulnerabilities on the
   testbed and identified 10 new 5G protocol vulnerabilities. Moreover, we
   analyzed the root cause of these vulnerabilities and concluded that all
   of them were caused by the unconditional trust between UE and gNodeB.
   Therefore, we propose an improved PKI mechanism based on the existing
   asymmetric encryption of 5G. Besides the existing public-private key
   pair of the home network, we introduce a new pair of asymmetric keys in
   the gNodeB to encrypt and sign the signalling message sent to UE. The
   gNodeB can be connected only when the verification succeeds and then the
   RRC connection can be initiated. This mechanism can effectively avoid
   all the vulnerabilities found in this paper.},

Abstract = {We give an attribute-based encryption system for Turing Machines that is
   provably secure assuming only the existence of identitybased encryption
   (IBE) for large identity spaces. Currently, IBE is known to be
   realizable from most mainstream number theoretic assumptions that imply
   public key cryptography including factoring, the search DiffieHellman
   assumption, and the Learning with Errors assumption. Our core
   construction provides security against an attacker that makes a single
   key query for a machine T before declaring a challenge string w{*} that
   is associated with the challenge ciphertext. We build our construction
   by leveraging a Garbled RAM construction of Gentry, Halevi, Raykova and
   Wichs {[}33]; however, to prove security we need to introduce a new
   notion of security called iterated simulation security. We then show how
   to transform our core construction into one that is secure forana-priori
   bounded number q = q(lambda) ofkey queries that canoccur either before
   or after the challenge ciphertext. We do this by first showing howone
   can use a special type of non-committing encryption to transform a
   system that is secure only if a singlekey is chosenbefore the challenge
   ciphertext is declared into one where the single key can be requested
   either before or after the challenge ciphertext. We give a simple
   construction of this noncommitting encryption from public key encryption
   in the Random Oracle Model. Next, one can apply standard combinatorial
   techniques to lift from single-key adaptive security to q-key adaptive
   security.},

Title = {A Novel Intrusion Detection Method in Train-Ground Communication System},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {178726-178743},
Abstract = {At present, the train-ground communication system based on the wireless
   communication protocol is a very important component of
   communication-based train control (CBTC) systems in intelligent
   transportation. Its information security is worthy of attention. In
   order to guarantee the security of the train-ground communication
   system, this paper proposes an improved AdaBoost multi-classification
   intrusion detection method based on the n-gram model. First, the n-gram
   model is used to model the state transitions of the IEEE 802.11
   protocol. Then, a typical normal behavior set and typical abnormal
   behavior sets are obtained by learning and they can portray typical
   behaviors of their respective classes. Furthermore, a similarity measure
   algorithm is proposed to construct AdaBoost weak classifiers, which
   improves the classification effect of AdaBoost algorithm. At last, an
   AdaBoost multi-classification algorithm is presented to detect and
   identify the attacks. Experiments prove that the algorithm can
   effectively detect and distinguish attack types in the train-ground
   communication system.},

Title = {Dynamic Exploration of a Controllable Thermosensitive Neuron Model and
   Its Applications},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIFURCATION AND CHAOS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {A specific functional electric component is connected to any branch of
   the neural circuit, which can enhance the corresponding biological
   function as a smart sensor, whereas the temperature has a significant
   effect on the firing rhythm of neurons by regulating channel conductance
   and excitability. So for this paper, a controllable thermosensitive
   neuron model is established by paralleling two thermistors in the
   FitzHugh-Nagumo neural circuit. Especially, the thermistors are
   controlled by two switches, where three working modes can be selected,
   for which bifurcation diagrams, time response diagrams and spectral
   entropy (SE) complexity are used to analyze the dynamic behaviors in
   different operating modes. It is found that any modulation of thermistor
   can regulate the branch current and output voltage completely under the
   three working modes. More importantly, the neuronal activities show
   different mode transitions from periodic to bursts or chaos. The
   superior dynamic characteristics and rich firing behavior make the new
   model more suitable for images encryption. For this purpose, we consider
   switching the three thermosensitive neuron models continuously to obtain
   more complex chaotic sequences. Next, based on the feature of high pixel
   correlation among color image components, a 3D projection scrambling
   algorithm is designed, and then employed in combination with the
   universal gravitational diffusion method to propose a color image
   encryption scheme. In addition, the designed algorithm is executed by
   encrypting and decrypting some color images. The experimental results
   show that the algorithm cannot only encrypt the color image effectively,
   but also has no limitation on the size of the test image. It is worth
   mentioning that the designed encrypted algorithm has satisfactory
   security performance and considerable robustness against noise attacks
   and shearing attacks. The exploration of this paper about the
   thermosensitive neuron model and its application may provide some
   theoretical guidance and experimental basis in the field of secure
   communication.},

Abstract = {Using role-based access control (RBAC) to manage RBAC is among RBAC's
   attractive benefits, contributing to its long-standing dominance in
   practice. Administrative models facilitate management of (mostly
   configuration) changes in the underlying operational models. Overall
   system security is crucially dependent on both the administrative and
   operational models.
   In this paper, we develop an RBAC administrative model to manage
   authorization assignments in the EGRBAC (enhanced generalized role-based
   access control) operational model for smart home IoT. We design the
   administrative model based on pairwise disjoint Administrative Units,
   each of which contains a uniquely assigned administrative role and a set
   of administrative tasks. Administrative tasks determine the
   administrative permissions available to manage the operational model
   assignments. We begin with a model containing a single administrative
   unit and then extend it to include additional units. Multiple
   administrative units enable decentralized administration which could be
   adapted to provide scalability in inherently distributed and large-scale
   environments beyond smart home, such as smart buildings or smart
   campuses. We provide formalism of our proposed model and illustrate it
   by specifying operational and administrative use cases. Although, the
   model is proposed based on a specific smart home operational model, our
   approach could be applied to environments with similar dynamics.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a new analysis method for early detection and
   prevention of power system cascading events. It uses the vulnerability
   index (VI) and margin index (MI) to evaluate the vulnerability and
   security of the individual system parts, as well as the whole system
   during an operating state. It identifies the vulnerable parts of the
   power system using the topology processing and operation index methods.
   For a given disturbance, it calculates the power flow, evaluates the
   vulnerability and security, identifies the vulnerable part, finds the
   transmission line overload and bus voltage problems, and predicts the
   possible successive events. The approach defines the control means using
   the following methods for early detection and prevention of cascading
   events: network contribution factor (NCF), generator distribution factor
   (GDF), load distribution factor (LDF), and selected minimum load
   shedding (SMLS). This approach has been tested using the IEEE RTS-96
   24-bus system and promising results have been obtained. The proposed
   approach allows the power system operator to detect initial stages of
   cascading events and assert actions that will prevent such events from
   unfolding. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Home Server plays an important role to manage all home network devices
   and multimedia content services in the digital home. Multimedia
   collaboration over wireless devices is inhibited by several factors and
   requires and advanced software architecture to support bandwidth
   reservation, QoS, reliability, availability and security. The decision
   based on a single input and a single security agent to serve all the
   needs of the home users is to be enhanced to facilitate multi-modal
   inputs with multiple integrated User Agents working to-ether to
   facilitate the new generation of dynamic wireless users at home.
   Cumulated with the technology trend of decreasing display sizes and
   ever-increasing array of features available to the user, it is very
   difficult to display all the features on the shrinking displays. Display
   has to be adaptive and context sensitive to adapt to the dynamic needs
   of the user. In this paper, we present our recent efforts for extending
   the functionalities of Home Server in order to support wireless
   multimedia collaboration and multi-modal context-sensitive analysis. We
   present a enhanced Home Server architecture that facilitates the
   existing model to be applied to incotporate wireless set-vices and
   wireless sensor networks for digital home automation. The plethora of
   possible inputs to the digital home infrastructure and the necessity for
   dynamic adaptive context-sensitive output extends the new design
   architecture to home servers and home networking devices.},

Title = {Routing optimization method of cyber-energy system considering
   cross-space cascading fault handling process},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {144},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The degree of coupling between information and energy is increased,
   leading to a cyber-energy system. The amount of information carried by
   communication networks is expanding, and if a cyber system fails or
   operates abnormally, the defect may propagate across space to the entire
   system. In this paper, a routing optimization method of cyber-energy
   systems is proposed to optimize information operations and respond to
   cyber attacks. To account for the difference in information demand
   between electricity and gas, we describe the communication business and
   determine the business's importance using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy
   approach. The risk assessment model is improved by analyzing the
   structural vulnerability of the energy system based on complex network
   theory. To coordinate various conditions, the approach is split into
   preventative and emergency control modes. The Yen algorithm and the
   fuzzy membership function are coupled in the preventative control mode
   to simultaneously optimize load balancing and communication risk. In the
   event of cyber attacks, the emergency control mode is triggered, which
   employs emergency isolation to minimize fault propagation and to
   preserve system stability in a partially disconnected operating state.
   Finally, the method's effectiveness is illustrated through using IEEE 30
   bus and gas 13 node coupling system.},

Abstract = {There have been many researches on border gateway protocol (BGP)
   security, most of which mainly focused on how to enhance the security of
   the BGP protocol or the interdomain routing system. However, few works
   studied the vulnerabilities especially the production mechanism of
   security events in the interdomain routing system. It takes many
   obstacles to understand and improve the security of the interdomain
   routing system. This paper explores the cascading failure phenomenon of
   the interdomain routing system. First, we devise a state machine to
   describe the state transition of BGP nodes and then give a detailed
   analysis of the BGP failure. Second, on the basis of the preferential
   attachment characteristic, we propose a cascading failure model for the
   interdomain routing system, which depicts the production mechanism of
   cascading failure, and introduce two evaluating indicators, the
   proportion of failed nodes and the proportion of failed links, to assess
   the scale of cascading failure. Furthermore, we apply the cascading
   failure model to display two different cascading failure scenes. The
   experimental results show that random failure has less influence on the
   interdomain routing system, while its robustness against hostile attack
   is weak. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes and evaluates a non-intrusive biometric
   authentication technique drawn from the discrete areas of biometrics and
   Auditory Evoked Responses. The technique forms a hybrid multi-modal
   biometric in which variations in the human voice due to the propagation
   effects of acoustic waves within the human head are used to verify the
   identity of a user. The resulting approach is known as the Head
   Authentication Technique (HAT). Evaluation of the HAT authentication
   process is realised in two stages. First, the generic authentication
   procedures of registration and verification are automated within a
   prototype implementation. Second, a HAT demonstrator is used to evaluate
   the authentication process through a series of experimental trials
   involving a representative user community. The results from the trials
   confirm that multiple HAT samples from the same user exhibit a high
   degree of correlation, yet samples between users exhibit a high degree
   of discrepancy. Statistical analysis of the prototype performance
   realised system error rates of 6\% False Non-Match Rate (FNMR) and
   0.025\% False Match Rate (FMR). (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) is the cryptographic
   primitive which enables fine grained access control while still
   providing end-to-end encryption. Although traditional encryption schemes
   can provide end-to-end encryption, users have to either share the same
   decryption keys or the data have to be stored in multiple instances
   which are encrypted with different keys. Both of these options are
   undesirable. However, KP-ABE can provide less key overhead compared to
   the traditional encryption schemes. While there are a lot of KP-ABE
   schemes, none of them simultaneously supports multiuse of attributes,
   adaptive security, monotone span programs, and static security
   assumption. Hence, we propose a fully secure KP-ABE scheme for monotone
   span programs in prime-order group. This scheme uses selective security
   proof techniques to obtain the requisite ingredients for full security
   proof. This strengthens the correlation between selective and full
   security models and enables the transition of the best qualities in
   selective security models to fully secure systems. The security proof is
   based on decisional linear assumption and three-party Diffie-Hellman
   assumption.},

   defect states have different measures. For Failed-Safe States, the
   repair process is adopted and for the other failed states is not. The
   repeatedly repairs have some influences on the operating times, repair
   times and the coverage to different failed states. Geometric Process is
   employed to describe this repair process and get some indexes of the
   system safety.},

Abstract = {With the wind generation increasingly penetrating the power grids, there
   is a growing interest in developing new risk-based assessments for the
   grids security analysis. This study develops one kind of such risk tools
   to evaluate the security risks of power grids under certain amount of
   wind generation in a short period of time. First of all, a very
   short-term uncertainty model of wind generation is introduced. Then the
   conditional value-at-risk is used to design a safety distance (S-D),
   revealing the tail risks of operating states. Based on S-D, four new
   indices are defined to highlight the risks in a near future with
   considerable change of wind power output. The overall security
   assessment tool is compared with the conventional method both on a
   benchmark test system and a real power system in China. The results
   demonstrate the effectiveness and some advantages of this new risk-based
   tool.},

Title = {Mercury: Combining Performance with Dependability Using
   Self-Virtualization},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {92-104},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Virtualization has recently gained popularity largely due to its promise
   in increasing utilization, improving availability and enhancing
   security. Very often, the role of computer systems needs to change as
   the business environment changes. Initially, the system may only need to
   host one operating system and seek full execution speed. Later, it may
   be required to add other functionalities such as allowing easy
   software/hardware maintenance, surviving system failures and hosting
   multiple operating systems. Virtualization allows these functionalities
   to be supported easily and effectively. However, virtualization
   techniques generally incur non-negligible performance penalty.
   Fortunately, many virtualization-enabled features such as online
   software/hardware maintenance and fault tolerance do not require
   virtualization standby all the time. Based on this observation, this
   paper proposes a technique, called Self-virtualization, which provides
   the operating system with the capability to turn on and off
   virtualization on demand, without disturbing running applications. This
   technique enables computer systems to reap most benefits from
   virtualization without sacrificing performance. This paper presents the
   design and implementation of Mercury, a working prototype based on Linux
   and Xen virtual machine monitor. The performance measurement shows that
   Mercury incurs very little overhead: about 0.2 ms on 3 GHz Xeon CPU to
   complete a mode switch, and negligible performance degradation compared
   to Linux.},

Abstract = {This paper has two main aims. The first is to reduce hardware
   management-related issues when working with complex networks. such as a
   lack of flexibility and scalability with regard to global configuration
   changes. The second is to create a communication library that provides
   programmable network function virtualization, helping to achieve the
   first aim. Specifically, we target low-cost, security-oriented networks
   that use broadband routers as L3 switches. When such networks have
   multiple II' domains between the external gateway and internal networks,
   domains that are lower in the hierarchy become more secure, but at the
   cost of flexibility. Our proposed system architecture aims to increase
   communication flexibility in such networks without requiring complex
   encapsulation and achieves this goal via a practical method that does
   not change the packet size. Finally, we conduct tests using an
   experimental implementation of the system, demonstrating its
   scalability.},

Abstract = {Mobile cloud computing integrates cloud computing into mobile
   environments, allowing users to use data, infrastructure, platforms, and
   applications on the cloud from their mobile devices. However, accessing
   and exploiting cloud-based resources and services is associated with
   numerous security implications (e.g. authentication and authorization)
   which represent the major barriers making individuals and organizations
   hesitant to migrate data or processing to the cloud. Using biometric
   techniques is increasingly emerging to secure such users' assets. In
   this paper, we propose a bi-modal continuous authentication approach
   integrating face and touch biometrics into mobile cloud environments,
   going beyond traditional one-off authentication. The system reacts to
   sliding windows of recent user's actions to dynamically update the trust
   in genuineness for the current user. For each biometric trait, it
   calculates the similarity scores resulting from the comparison between
   probes and templates, then they are fused together. If the fusion score
   is above a given threshold, the system rewards the current user;
   otherwise, they are penalized. In case the trust in the current user
   drops below a predefined threshold, the system raises an alarm.
   Experimental results indicate the advantage offered by our approach on
   performance of continuous authentication systems, providing a good
   security-usability tradeoff to mobile cloud environments.},

Title = {Security Against Hardware Trojan Attacks Using Key-Based Design
   Obfuscation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC TESTING-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {27},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Malicious modification of hardware in untrusted fabrication facilities,
   referred to as hardware Trojan, has emerged as a major security concern.
   Comprehensive detection of these Trojans during post-manufacturing test
   has been shown to be extremely difficult. Hence, it is important to
   develop design techniques that provide effective countermeasures against
   hardware Trojans by either preventing Trojan attacks or facilitating
   detection during test. Obfuscation is a technique that is conventionally
   employed to prevent piracy of software and hardware intellectual
   property (IP). In this work, we propose a novel application of key-based
   circuit structure and functionality obfuscation to achieve protection
   against hardware Trojans triggered by rare internal circuit conditions.
   The proposed obfuscation scheme is based on judicious modification of
   the state transition function, which creates two distinct functional
   modes: normal and obfuscated. A circuit transitions from the obfuscated
   to the normal mode only upon application of a specific input sequence,
   which defines the key. We show that it provides security against Trojan
   attacks in two ways: (1) it makes some inserted Trojans benign, i.e.
   they become effective only in the obfuscated mode; and (2) it prevents
   an adversary from exploiting the true rare events in a circuit to insert
   hard-to-detect Trojans. The proposed design methodology can thus achieve
   simultaneous protection from hardware Trojans and hardware IP piracy.
   Besides protecting ICs against Trojan attacks in foundry, we show that
   it can also protect against malicious modifications by untrusted
   computer-aided design (CAD) tools in both SoC and FPGA design flows.
   Simulation results for a set of benchmark circuits show that the scheme
   is capable of achieving high levels of security against Trojan attacks

Abstract = {Autonomous Mobile agents can be extremely useful in dynamic environments
   that require a continuous network connection. Network bandwidth
   reduction, protocol encapsulation, software automation and intelligence
   gathering can significantly affect Web Services. Integrating mobile
   agents with Web Services enables software adaptation to cope with a
   dynamic environment, automated system configuration and application
   requirement changes that are frequent in today's ever fast-evolving
   technology. In this paper, we use a lightweight and efficient
   composition for mobile agents based Web services complying with
   Representational State Transfer (REST) principles for agent creation,
   migration, and control. The paper presents the overall concept and
   architecture of RESTful agents for web services. A security scheme is
   proposed for mobile agent security based on an infrastructure-less
   Identity Based Encryption (IBE) scheme integrated with Broadcast based
   Secure Mobile Agent Protocol (BROSMAP). A proof-of-concept
   implementation is provided.},

Abstract = {For floating nuclear power plants, the internal power system adopts the
   generator-grid directly connected structure. Generator ground fault
   diagnosis enables the protective device to adaptively determine the
   generator tripping control mode based on the fault degree, and shorten
   the troubleshooting time by fault location. To accurately calculate the
   ground fault current under different system operating modes, a real-time
   grounding capacitance parameters calculation method without injection
   devices is proposed based on third harmonic voltage. Using the fault
   component principle, the ground fault current is calculated including
   the fundamental and the third harmonic components. Through fuzzy
   membership function, the ground fault degree function is established
   including the ground fault current and the system overvoltage. It
   comprehensively reflects the damage degree of both the generator
   operating security and the system insulation security. According to the
   60 degrees phase-band distribution characteristic of the stator
   windings, a fault coil location method based on the windings' electric
   potential distribution characteristics is proposed. PSCAD/EMTDC
   simulation results show that the proposed method has high computational
   accuracy. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Qualitative and Quantitative Transient Stability Assessment of
   Stand-Alone Hybrid Microgrids in a Cluster Environment},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Neighboring stand-alone hybrid microgrids with diesel generators (DGs)
   as well as grid-feeding photovoltaics (PV) and grid-forming battery
   storage systems (BSS) can be coupled to reduce fuel costs and emissions
   as well as to enhance the security of supply. In contrast to the
   research in control and small-signal rotor angle stability of
   microgrids, there is a significant lack of knowledge regarding the
   transient stability of off-grid hybrid microgrids in a cluster
   environment. Therefore, the large-signal rotor angle stability of pooled
   microgrids was assessed qualitatively and also quantitatively in this
   research work. Quantitative transient stability assessment (TSA) was
   carried out with the help of the-recently developed and
   validated-micro-hybrid method by combining time-domain simulations and
   transient energy function analyses. For this purpose, three realistic
   dynamic microgrids were modelled regarding three operating modes
   (island, interconnection, and cluster) as well as the conventional
   scenario ``classical{''} and four hybrid scenarios ({''}storage{''},
   ``sun{''}, ``sun \& storage{''}, and ``night{''}) regarding different
   instants of time on a tropical partly sunny day. It can be inferred
   that, coupling hybrid microgrids is feasible from the voltage,
   frequency, and also transient stability point of view. However, the risk
   of large-signal rotor angle instability in pooled microgrids is
   relatively higher than in islanded microgrids. Along with critical
   clearing times, new stability-related indicators such as system
   stability degree and corrected critical clearing times should be taken
   into account in the planning phase and in the operation of microgrids.
   In principle, a general conclusion concerning the best operating mode
   and scenario of the investigated microgrids cannot be drawn. TSA of
   pooled hybrid microgrids should be performed-on a regular basis
   especially in the grid operation-for different loading conditions,
   tie-line power flows, topologies, operating modes, and scenarios.},

Abstract = {In order to tolerate possible leakage of secret keys, leakage-resilient
   cryptosystem models a class of attractive leakage output by allowing an

   can generate multiple private keys per user by periodically updating the
   key. We use the dual system encryption mechanism to implement the
   leakage resilience and adaptive security, and intrinsically set an
   algorithm to refresh a key and produce a same distributed new key. We
   also give the evaluation of the leakage bound and leakage fraction, and
   the simulations show that our scheme can tolerate about 71\% leakage
   fraction with 3.34 x 10(-52) failure probability in standard 80-bit

Abstract = {In deregulated power systems, several market models are prevalent as
   alternatives to the traditional vertically integrated utilities.
   Consequently transmission networks are subjected to various bilateral
   service contracts between customers and suppliers. These transactions
   adversely affect power system security, and are thus executed only as
   far as the system design and operating conditions permit. Therefore,
   fast assessment of the impact of such transactions is one of the prime
   responsibilities of any system operator. This paper presents a scheme
   for comprehensive assessment of the impact of multiple, simultaneous
   bilateral transactions on the operating state of the transmission
   network. It employs improved distribution factors derived from the base
   case Jacobian matrix, for computation of voltage and real power flow
   (and real power loss). Results are presented for three standard test
   systems, and a comparison with the AC load flow results (and results
   obtained using DC power flow based distribution factors) shows that the
   method is fairly accurate. The paper is organized in the particular
   context of bilateral transactions, but possible applications of the
   proposed approach are also enumerated. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are promising solutions for safe and
   comfortable driving. The evolution of AVs are driven by various
   technical and socio-economic factors. Autonomous navigation in AVs is
   the ability to plan and navigate towards a destination, while dealing
   with the path's obstacles. Current research solutions rely on sensors
   and inter-vehicular communication to perceive the environment. But they
   are susceptible to threats ranging from physical damage to security
   issues. Hence, to improve the AV's perception capabilities, this article
   proposes a multi-modal mechanism known as Audio-Visual Cognitive
   Processing System (AV-CPS), which combines speech and gesture inputs
   from users to enable spontaneous passenger control for AVs. The results
   demonstrate over 20\% improvement in action prediction accuracy over
   uni-modal mechanisms and a relative reduction in response time from the
   simulation of the AV-CPS.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an accurate and efficient method to compute the
   minimum voltage stability security margin (VSSM) of electrical power
   systems. Many network planning and operation procedures set forth by
   Independent System Operators and followed by many utilities consider the
   computation of the VSSM for a predefined load increase direction.
   Usually, this direction corresponds to increasing all loads with
   constant power factor and the MW generated at generation buses by using
   one loading factor only. However, situations may occur where small
   variations in this direction, as for example, an unexpected load
   increase at any bus or set of buses, may result in smaller VSSM, thus
   leading the system to an insecure operating state. The goal of this
   paper is to propose a combination of a fast method to estimate the VSSM
   with an efficient method to calculate the appropriate direction of load
   increase for which the margin is minimum. This information, along with
   the usual VSSM, can provide system operators with relevant information
   regarding the system's security. More complete information allow
   operators to take decisions like preventive control actions to move the
   system to a securer operating point. The procedure is divided into two
   main stages. The first one consists of estimating the maximum loading
   point (MLP) and consequently the VSSM, by using nonlinear programming
   techniques. The second stage consists of computing new directions of
   load increase. These new directions are based on eigenvector handling.
   Also, the use of a special load flow method with step size optimization
   results into a more efficient computation process. Simulation results
   for IEEE standard and realistic power systems are shown to evaluate the
   method.},

Abstract = {To cope with a large amount of data in current sensed environments,
   decision aid tools should provide their understanding of situations in a
   time-efficient manner, so there is an increasing need for real-time
   network security situation awareness and threat assessment. In this
   study, the state transition model of vulnerability in the network based
   on semi-Markov process is proposed at first. Once events are triggered
   by an attacker's action or system response, the current states of the
   vulnerabilities are known. Then we calculate the transition
   probabilities of the vulnerability from the current state to security
   failure state. Furthermore in order to improve accuracy of our
   algorithms, we adjust the probabilities that they exploit the
   vulnerability according to the attacker's skill level. In the light of
   the preconditions and post-conditions of vulnerabilities in the network,
   attack graph is built to visualize security situation in real time.
   Subsequently, we predict attack path, recognize attack intention and
   estimate the impact through analysis of attack graph. These help
   administrators to insight into intrusion steps, determine security state
   and assess threat. Finally testing in a network shows that this method
   is reasonable and feasible, and can undertake tremendous analysis task
   to facilitate administrators' work.},

Abstract = {Recent advancements in the Internet, web and communication technologies
   cut across many areas of modern-day living and enabled interconnection
   of every physical object, including, sensors and actuators. Web-enabled
   smart objects empower innovative services and applications for different
   domains and improve utilization of resources. In this paper, we propose
   an interoperable Internet-of-Things (IoTs) platform for a smart home
   system using a Web-of-Objects (WoO) and cloud architecture. The proposed
   platform controls the home appliances from anywhere and also provides
   the homes' data in the cloud for various service providers' applications
   and analysis. Firstly, we proposed a Raspberry PI based gateway for
   interoperability among various legacy home appliances, different
   communication technologies, and protocols. Secondly, we bring the smart
   home appliances to the web and make it accessible through the
   Representational State Transfer (REST/RESTful) framework. Thirdly, we
   will provide the cloud server for smart homes' to store the homes' data
   due to low storage capabilities at a gateway and provide the data for
   various application's service providers and analysis. In the proposed
   smart home platform, we implement a water-tank control using Zigbee
   communication, an automatic door security using a normal camera as an IP
   camera, and provide web connectivity to different home devices for
   web-based controlling. We aim to reduce the human intervention, secure
   access control to home devices from anywhere, provide smart homes data
   for application services as well as for analysis, and improve the
   utilization of resources.},

Abstract = {Automatic personal identification is becoming an increasingly important
   requirement in a variety of applications like access control,
   surveillance systems and physical buildings. In recent years, biometric
   systems are used in these fields, offering greater convenience and
   several advantages over traditional security. In this paper, we propose
   an efficient online personal identification system based on
   Finger-Knuckle-Print (FKP) images. In this study, the finger image is
   characterized by the two dimensional Bloc based Discrete Cosine
   Transform (2D-BDCT) coefficients. Then, we use the Hidden Markov Model
   (HMM) for modeling the observation vector. In addition, the same finger
   is transformed by the two dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform
   (2D-DFT). The response of this transformation is directly used to create
   another observation vector. Subsequently, the two subsystems are
   integrated in order to construct an efficient multi-modal identification
   system based on matching score level fusion. The results on a
   medium-size database, 150 users, show good identification performance
   based on individual modalities as well as after fusing multiple finger
   types.},

Abstract = {SNOW-3G and ZUC are two stream ciphers standardized by the 3GPP (3rd
   Generation Partnership Project) organization to ensure the LTE (Long
   Term Evolution of radio networks) security. Unfortunately, these
   algorithms present some weaknesses. The main objective of this study is
   to design and implement an enhanced algorithm combining the
   functionalities of standard SNOW-3G and ZUC algorithms in order to
   provide security to the LTE network. A chaotic generator has been used
   to increase the randomness and robustness of generated key-streams. The
   proposed architecture was implemented on Xilinx virtex-5 FPGA technology
   and its security was evaluated using many security tests (generated
   key-stream distribution, key sensitivity, key space, and NIST
   statistical tests). The experimental results show that the proposed
   design allows to encrypt data in two operating modes (SNOW-3G and ZUC
   modes) using limited hardware resources and power consumption while
   ensuring more resistance against cryptanalysis attacks.},

Title = {Optimal Energy Reserve Scheduling in Integrated Electricity and Gas
   Systems Considering Reliability Requirements},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MODERN POWER SYSTEMS AND CLEAN ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {With the growing interdependence between the electricity system and the
   natural gas system, the operation uncertainties in either subsystem,
   such as wind fluctuations or component failures, could have a magnified
   impact on the reliability of the whole system due to energy
   interactions. A joint reserve scheduling model considering the
   cross-sectorial impacts of operation uncertainties is essential but
   still insufficient to guarantee the reliable operation of the integrated
   electricity and natural gas system (IEGS). Therefore, this paper
   proposes a day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) model
   for the IEGS to schedule the operation and reserve simultaneously
   considering reliability requirements. Firstly, the multi-state models
   for generating units and gas wells are established. Based on the
   multi-state models, the expected unserved energy cost (EUEC) and the
   expected wind curtailment cost (EWC) criteria are proposed based on
   probabilistic methods considering wind fluctuation and random failures
   of components in IEGS. Furthermore, the EUEC and EWC criteria are
   incorporated into the day-ahead SCUC model, which is nonconvex and
   mathematically reformulated into a solvable mixed-integer second-order
   cone programming (MISOCP) problem. The proposed model is validated using
   an IEEE 30-bus system and Belgium 20-node natural gas system. Numerical
   results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively schedule the
   energy reserve to guarantee the reliable operation of the IEGS
   considering the multiple uncertainties in different subsystems and the
   cross-sectorial failure propagation.},

Abstract = {The increasing penetration of wind energy poses great challenges to the
   operation of power systems in normal and emergency states. However,
   energy storage technologies can help accommodate wind power uncertainty
   and variability due to their flexible characteristics. This paper
   focuses on the restoration phase, and provides a novel coordination
   strategy of wind and pumped-storage hydro (PSH) units for a faster and
   reliable self-healing process. The wind-PSH assisted power system
   restoration is formulated as a two-stage adaptive robust optimization
   problem. The first-stage problem determines the start-up sequence of
   generators and the energization times of transmission paths; and the
   second-stage problem decides load pickup sequences, wind power dispatch
   levels, and PSH units' operating modes. The column-and-constraint
   generation decomposition algorithm is applied to solve the two-stage
   adaptive robust optimization problem, which has a mixed-integer
   optimization in the inner-level problem. The developed coordination
   strategy is tested on the modified IEEE 39-bus system. Numerical results
   demonstrate that the coordinated wind and PSH units can increase the
   total energy served, enhance wind power dispatchability, and reduce wind
   power curtailment.},

Abstract = {In this paper it is proposed an efficient contingency screening and
   ranking algorithm for assessment and classification of multiple
   contingencies of an Electric Power System using the Rough Set theory.
   The developed methodology produces a classification of the system
   operation in five possible states: normal, alert, emergency, in-extremis
   and restorative. These different operating states correspond to six
   levels of security: secure, alert, correctively secure, alert no
   correctable, emergency and restorative. The states can be classified
   horizontally as secure, that correspond to the normal state and insecure
   for the remaining ones. The developed computer programs, the SECURsySTEM
   were applied to the IEEE 118 busbars test power network and results are
   presented and analyzed.},

Abstract = {A static vulnerability detection method based on an extended
   vulnerability state machine is proposed in this paper. In this method,
   the state space of state machine model is extended. The security state
   of a variable can be identified by a property set that may consist of
   multiple security-related properties rather than a single property. As
   results, fine-grained state transition is provided to support accurate
   recognition of program security-related behaviors. Specially, the
   recognition of validation checking is introduced to reduce false
   positives. Besides, a systematic discrimination mechanism for tainted
   data is constructed to prevent false negatives result from neglecting
   tainted data sources. The experimental results of a prototype system
   show that this method can effectively detect vulnerabilities in software
   systems with obviously lower false positive than existing methods, and
   avoid some serious false negative.},

Title = {A NoSQL-SQL Hybrid Organization and Management Approach for Real-Time
   Geospatial Data: A Case Study of Public Security Video Surveillance},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With the widespread deployment of ground, air and space sensor sources
   (internet of things or IoT, social networks, sensor networks), the
   integrated applications of real-time geospatial data from ubiquitous
   sensors, especially in public security and smart city domains, are
   becoming challenging issues. The traditional geographic information
   system (GIS) mostly manages time-discretized geospatial data by means of
   the Structured Query Language (SQL) database management system (DBMS)
   and emphasizes query and retrieval of massive historical geospatial data
   on disk. This limits its capability for on-the-fly access of real-time
   geospatial data for online analysis in real time. This paper proposes a
   hybrid database organization and management approach with SQL relational
   databases (RDB) and not only SQL (NoSQL) databases (including the main
   memory database, MMDB, and distributed files system, DFS). This hybrid
   approach makes full use of the advantages of NoSQL and SQL DBMS for the
   real-time access of input data and structured on-the-fly analysis
   results which can meet the requirements of increased spatio-temporal big
   data linking analysis. The MMDB facilitates real-time access of the
   latest input data such as the sensor web and IoT, and supports the
   real-time query for online geospatial analysis. The RDB stores change
   information such as multi-modal features and abnormal events extracted
   from real-time input data. The DFS on disk manages the massive
   geospatial data, and the extensible storage architecture and distributed
   scheduling of a NoSQL database satisfy the performance requirements of
   incremental storage and multi-user concurrent access. A case study of
   geographic video (GeoVideo) surveillance of public security is presented
   to prove the feasibility of this hybrid organization and management
   approach.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a secure authentication method based on
   multimodal biometrics system under ubiquitous computing environments.
   For this, the face and signature images are acquired in PDA and then
   each image with user ID and name is transmitted via WLAN (Wireless LAN)
   to the server and finally the PDA receives authentication result from
   the server. In the proposed system, face recognition algorithm is
   designed by PCA and LDA. On the other hand, the signature verification
   is designed by a novel method based on grid partition, Kernel PCA and
   LDA. To calculate the similarity between test image and training image,
   we adopt the selective distance measure determined by various
   experiments. More specifically, Mahalanobis and Euclidian distance
   measures are used for face and signature, respectively. As the fusion
   step, decision rule by weighted sum fusion scheme effectively combines
   the two matching scores calculated in each biometric system. From the
   real-time experiments, we convinced that the proposed system makes it
   possible to improve the security as well as user's convenience under
   ubiquitous computing environments.},

Abstract = {The security of SCADA systems is one of the most pressing subjects in
   industrial systems, especially for those installation actively using the
   public network in order to provide new features and services. In this
   paper we present an innovative approach to the design of Filtering
   Systems based on the state analysis of the system being monitored. The
   aim is to detect attacks composed of a set of ``SCADA{''} commands that,
   while licit when considered in isolation on a single-packet basis, can
   disrupt the correct behavior of the system when executed in particular
   operating states. The proposed firewall detects these complex attacks
   thanks to an internal representation of the controlled SCADA system.
   Furthermore, we detail the design of the architecture of the IDS for
   systems using the ModBus and DNP3 protocols, and the implementation of a
   prototype, providing experimental comparative results that confirm the
   validity of the proposed approach.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a geometrical model that projects malicious and
   benign events (e.g., attacks, security countermeasures) as pyramidal
   instances in a multidimensional coordinate system. The approach
   considers internal event data related to the target system (e.g., users,
   physical, and logical resources, IP addresses, port numbers, etc.), and
   external event data related to the attacker (e.g., knowledge,
   motivation, skills, etc.) that can be obtained a priori and a
   posteriori. Internal data is used to model the base of the pyramid,
   whereas external data is used to model its height. In addition, the
   approach considers state transitions taken by the attacker to model the
   steps of a multi-stage attack to reach to its final goal. As a result,
   for each modeled state, new countermeasures are evaluated and the
   attacker's knowledge a posteriori changes accordingly, making it
   possible to evaluate the impact of the attack at time T-i, where i
   denotes the stage at which the attack is executed. A graphical
   representation of the impact of each evaluated event is depicted for
   visualization purposes. A use case of a cyber-physical system is
   proposed at the end of the paper to illustrate the applicability of the
   proposed geometrical model.},

Abstract = {The rapidly changing world of Power System Operations requires advanced,
   flexible \& adaptive software solutions to ensure seamless Transmission
   Network operations. Thus, suitable tools are used to monitor, assess the
   security, analyze and optimize the System operations. The tool present
   at Control Centres to realise above tasks is termed as Energy Management
   Systems (EMS). State Estimator (SE) forms the front end of EMS system.It
   is responsible for providing a complete, accurate, consistent and
   reliable real-time scenario for analysis, control, and optimization of
   the system. Realization of SE at a control centre monitoring a wide and
   complicated power system is challenging several times. Major challenges
   for SE to function consistently are modelling of equipment, equipment
   operating modes, trade-off between telemetry and network expansion to
   include parallel network at lower transmission voltages, location of
   measurement in actual system vrs its location in the EMS model etc. This
   paper gives details of those challenges faced and their solutions during
   in course of implementation of EMS in Northern Regional Control Centre

Abstract = {East/West-bound communication is the communication channel which exists
   only in the distributed software-defined network (SDN) that governs the
   communication within the control plane of the network. Unlike most SDN
   projects, that have neglected the security of, and have achieved
   east/west-bound communication with the assistance of a network
   application on the management plane through the representational state
   transfer (REST) application program interface (API), the Open Networking
   Operating System (ONOS) was designed with distributed functionality as
   one of its core features. Hence, it supports both the native
   intra-cluster and the network application's inter-cluster communication.
   In this paper, the transport layer security (TLS) channel for ONOS's
   native east/west-bound communication was implemented and the performance
   impact was evaluated.},

Title = {Adaptively secure multi-authority attribute-based broadcast encryption
   in fog computing},
Journal = {COMPUTER NETWORKS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {232},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Fog computing is considered an important development in cloud computing,
   with shorter response times, less data transfer load and a more secure
   distributed service architecture that can be accessed by a wide range of
   end devices. As with cloud computing, it also faces the challenge of how
   to securely distribute sensitive data. Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based
   Broadcast Encryption (CP-ABBE) can protect sensitive data and provide
   fine-grained access control with user revocation. However, existing
   CP-ABBE schemes suffer many limitations when implemented in a fog
   computing environment: a single authority performs poorly in handling
   requests or data from many IoT devices, leading to system delays or
   limited functionality; expensive decryption costs make the computation
   and storage overheads unfriendly to devices with limited resources;
   these schemes are only proven selectively secure, meaning that security
   was proven in a weaker model. In this paper, using threshold secret
   sharing and decryption delegation, we propose an adaptively secure
   attribute-based multi-authority broadcast encryption (MA-ABBE) scheme
   that breaks through these limitations. The comparison and analysis
   results show that our scheme is practical and achieves adaptive
   security, enables user-side fast decryption and low storage overhead,
   and provides a secure and efficient option for protecting sensitive data
   in fog computing environments.},

Abstract = {Communication-based Train Control (CBTC) systems are the burgeoning
   directions for developing future train control systems. With the
   adoption of wireless communication and network techniques, train control
   systems are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Notably, the jamming
   attacks, aiming at the handoff process that is the weakest part of train
   ground communication systems, will cause long disruption of
   communication. It will have a severe impact on train control operation
   efficiency. Current research regarding industry control system security
   is hard to model the impact of the jamming attacks on the train control
   system quantitatively, and current countermeasure schemes against
   jamming attacks are not designed for the operating mechanism of train
   control systems. This paper first builds the train control security
   state transition probability model under jamming attacks. A cross-layer
   defense scheme is then proposed from the aspect of the physical layer,
   the cyber layer and the management layer. In the physical layer, this
   paper designs a model prediction control algorithm to track dynamic
   target signals, in the hopes of eventually tracking the dynamic target
   quickly and smoothly. In the cyber layer, a multi-stage and zero-sum
   stochastic game model is built for the channel selection for the attack
   and the defense, whereby the channel selection randomized policy will be
   obtained. In the management layer, a dynamic train travel speed profile
   generation algorithm is proposed to mitigate the jamming attacks' impact
   on train control systems. Extensive simulation results are shown that
   jamming attack impact on CBTC can be mitigated effectively with our
   proposed cross-layer defense scheme.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an approach based on generic component model
   to realise the designing of an integrated wind-water desalination
   reliable control system. Two elementary notions, the service and the
   operating mode, are introduced to construct a hierarchical system and to
   assure the coherences between specification and realisation at each
   level and between levels. The consideration of aggregated, complex
   components not only leads to extend this description to the
   possibilities of reconfiguration, but also provides a unified framework
   for facilitating the knowledge acquisition of reconfiguration.
   Reconfigurable control is intended to continue the system operation as
   long as possible in the presence of one or several faults, provided both
   efficiency and security remain acceptable. An integrated wind-water
   desalination reliable control system is studied as an application.},

   and contribute to an Anonymous RIBE (ARIBE) scheme with two advantages:
   (1) the provable full security under the adaptive-ID attack in the
   standard model and (2) the sufficient efficiency in optimal
   parameters-the secret subkey and the update subkey are one group element
   each and decryption only requires two pairings. To our best knowledge,
   our construction is the first IBE scheme that simultaneously achieves
   efficient revocability, anonymity and full security in the

Abstract = {Utilizing biometric traits for privacy-and security-applications is
   receiving an increasing attention. Applications such as personal
   identification, access control, forensics applications, e-banking,
   e-government, e-health and recently personalized human-smart-home and
   human-robot interaction present some examples. In order to offer
   person-specific services for/of specific person a pre-identifying step
   should be done in the run-up. Using biometric in such application is
   encountered by diverse challenges. First, using one trait and excluding
   the others depends on the application aimed to. Some applications demand
   directly touch to biometric sensors, while others don't. Second
   challenge is the reliability of used biometric arrangement. Civilized
   application demands lower reliability comparing to the forensics ones.
   And third, for biometric system could only one trait be used (uni-modal
   systems) or multiple traits (Bi-or Multi-modal systems). The latter is
   applied, when systems with a relative high reliability are expected. The
   main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive view about biometric
   and its application. The above mentioned challenges will be analyzed
   deeply. The suitability of each biometric sensor according to the aimed
   application will be deeply discussed. Detailed comparison between
   uni-modal and Multi-modal biometric system will present which system
   where to be utilized. Privacy and security issues of biometric systems
   will be discussed too. Three scenarios of biometric application in
   home-environment, humanrobot-interaction and e-health will be presented.},

Abstract = {A number of security vulnerability assessments require accurate and fast
   extraction of the finite state machines (FSMs) in the circuit. FSM
   should be accurately extracted for watermark insertion, FSM-based logic
   locking, fault injection assessment of control paths in a system-on-chip
   (SoC), information leakage assessment, and reverse engineering at
   gate-level. Unfortunately, as of today, there are no good solutions
   available that can provide very fast and accurate extraction of FSMs
   from the flattened netlist to perform effective security assessment. The
   difficulty of developing such a solution lies in precisely identifying
   FSM state flip-flops present in a netlist that contains numerous circuit
   flip-flops. In this paper, we propose to develop a framework called FSMx
   to extract FSMs from highly unstructured synthesized designs. FSMx
   utilizes graph theory to identify FSM state registers from other
   registers. FSMx automatically extracts gate-level state transition
   graphs (STGs) for each of the detected FSM state registers. Experimental
   results demonstrate that FSMx efficiently recovers FSMs from synthesized
   netlists with various complexity and size in less than 7 minutes in the
   worst case of NIST AES 128-bit design with 12,976 gates on a personal
   desktop.},

Abstract = {Authentication on smartphones for high valued transactions in e-banking
   applications require authentication methods that are both more robust
   and more convenient than simple PIN based authentication. Although a two
   factor authentication approach can increase the system security, the
   second factor has to be robust enough not to be compromised by simple
   attacks. Face and periocular based biometrics have been explored in many
   works for authentication on smartphone. Multi-modal biometrics always
   have an edge over the unimodal biometrics. In this work, we explore
   various multi-modal biometrics employing feature level and score level
   fusion to improve the biometric performance of the system. An extensive
   number of experiments are conducted using two different devices -
   Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone and Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. The
   database consisting of 46 subjects has provided a performance with best
   Genuine Match Rate (GMR) of 95. 52\% for smartphone and 96. 65\% GMR for
   tablet. The obtained scores for feature level and score level fusion
   advocates the use of a fused approaches over a unimodal biometric
   authentication on the smartphones.},

Abstract = {We present an autonomous system capable of performing security check
   routines. The surveillance machine, the Clearpath Husky robotic
   platform, is equipped with three IP cameras with different orientations
   for the surveillance tasks of face recognition, human activity
   recognition, autonomous navigation and 3D reconstruction of its
   environment. Combining the computer vision algorithms onto a robotic
   machine has given birth to the Robust Artificial Intelligence-based
   Defense Electro-Robot (RAIDER). The end purpose of the RAIDER is to
   conduct a patrolling routine on a single floor of a building several
   times a day. As the RAIDER travels down the corridors off-line
   algorithms use two of the RAIDER's side mounted cameras to perform a 3D
   reconstruction from monocular vision technique that updates a 3D model
   to the most current state of the indoor environment. Using frames from
   the front mounted camera, positioned at the human eye level, the system
   performs face recognition with real time training of unknown subjects.
   Human activity recognition algorithm will also be implemented in which
   each detected person is assigned to a set of action classes picked to
   classify ordinary and harmful student activities in a hallway setting.
   The system is designed to detect changes and irregularities within an
   environment as well as familiarize with regular faces and actions to
   distinguish potentially dangerous behavior. In this paper, we present
   the various algorithms and their modifications which when implemented on
   the RAIDER serves the purpose of indoor surveillance.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses our experience evaluating attack paths and security
   controls in commonly used, real-world ICS safety system architectures.
   Specifically, we sought to determine if an SIS-mediated architecture
   could provide better protection against unauthorized and malicious
   safety instrument configuration changes than could a MUX-mediated
   architecture.
   An assessment question-driven approach was layered on top of standard
   penetration assessment methods. Test cases were planned around the
   questions and a sample set of vendor products typically used in the oil
   and gas sector. Four systems were composed from different product
   subsets and were assessed using the test cases. We analyzed results from
   the four assessments to illuminate issues that existed regardless of
   system composition.
   Analysis revealed recurring vulnerabilities that exist in all safety
   systems due to issues in the design of safety instruments and the HART
   protocol. We found that device-native hardware write-protections provide
   the best defense, followed by SIS write protections. We concluded that,
   when using SIS security controls, an SIS-mediated system can protect
   against unauthorized device reconfigurations better than can a MUX-based
   system. When SIS security controls are not used, there is no added
   security benefit.
   We present lessons learned for ICS stakeholders and for people who are
   interested in conducting this kind of evaluation.},

Abstract = {Cyber-security risks for Internet of Things (IoT) devices sourced from a
   diversity of vendors and deployed in large numbers, are growing rapidly.
   Therefore, management of these devices is becoming increasingly
   important to network operators. Existing network monitoring technologies
   perform traffic analysis using specialized acceleration on network
   switches, or full inspection of packets in software, which can be
   complex, expensive, inflexible, and unscalable. In this paper, we use
   SDN paradigm combined with machine learning to leverage the benefits of
   programmable flow-based telemetry with flexible data-driven models to
   manage IoT devices based on their network activity. Our contributions
   are three-fold: (1) We analyze traffic traces of 17 real consumer IoT
   devices collected in our lab over a six-month period and identify a set
   of traffic flows (per-device) whose time-series attributes computed at
   multiple timescales (from a minute to an hour) characterize the network
   behavior of various IoT device types, and their operating states (i.e.,
   booting, actively interacted with user, or being idle); (2) We develop a
   multi-stage architecture of inference models that use flow-level
   attributes to automatically distinguish IoT devices from non-IoTs,
   classify individual types of IoT devices, and identify their states
   during normal operations. We train our models and validate their
   efficacy using real traffic traces; and (3) We quantify the trade-off
   between performance and cost of our solution, and demonstrate how our
   monitoring scheme can be used in operation for detecting behavioral
   changes (firmware upgrade or cyber attacks).},

Title = {Research on a PSO-H-SVM-Based Intrusion Detection Method for Industrial
   Robotic Arms},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Featured Application This research is mainly used for intrusion
   detection against physical process logic attacks that industrial robotic
   arms may be subject to, and the establishment of response mechanisms.
   The automation and intelligence of industrial manufacturing is the core
   of the fourth industrial revolution, and robotic arms and proprietary
   networked information systems are an integral part of this vision.
   However, with the benefits come risks that have been overlooked, and
   robotic arms have become a heavily attacked area. In order to improve
   the security of the robotic arm system, this paper proposes an intrusion
   detection method based on a state classification model. The closure
   operation process of the robotic arm is divided into five consecutive
   states, while a support vector machine based on the particle swarm
   optimization algorithm (PSO-H-SVM) classifies the operation state of the
   robotic arm. In the detection process, the classifier predicts the
   operation state of the robotic arm in real time, and the detection
   method determines whether the state transfer meets the logical
   requirements, and then determines whether the intrusion occurs. In
   addition, a response mechanism is proposed on the basis of the intrusion
   detection system to make protection measures for the robotic arm system.
   Finally, a physical experiment platform was built to test the intrusion
   detection method. The results showed that the classification accuracy of
   the PSO-H-SVM algorithm reached 96.02\%, and the detection accuracy of
   the intrusion detection method reached 90\%, which verified the
   effectiveness and reliability of the intrusion detection method.},

Abstract = {The security of Industrial Critical Infrastructures is become a
   prominent problem with the advent of modern ICT technologies used to
   improve the performances and the features of the SCADA systems. In this
   paper we present an innovative approach to the design of Intrusion
   Detection Systems. The aim is to be able to detect complex attacks to
   SCADA systems, by monitoring its state evolution. By complex attack, we
   mean attacks composed of a set of commands that, while licit when
   considered in isolation on a single-packet basis, can disrupt the
   correct behavior of the system when executed in particular operating
   states. The proposed IDS detects these complex attacks thanks to an
   internal representation of the controlled SCADA system. We also present
   the corresponding rule language powerful enough to express the system's
   critical states. Furthermore, we present a prototype of the proposed
   IDS, able to monitor systems using the ModBus and DNP3 communication
   protocols.},

Abstract = {tIn recent years, DC distribution system has been considered as an
   efficient solution in Shipboard Power Systems (SPS) to improve the
   system performance in several aspects such as overall efficiency,
   reliability, security and size. However, rising fuel price, its
   unpredictability, growing global demand for energy and the necessity to
   decrease environmental pollution have led to an ever-increasing trend
   for using Alternative Power Sources (APSs) and Energy Storage Systems
   (ESSs) into Next-Generation Shipboard Power Systems (NG-SPS). In this
   respect, the future SPSs provide great advantages but really complicate
   and introduce new challenges about system security and stability. Hence,
   exact evaluation of system dynamic performance has become a major
   concern and require an effective simulation-based modeling. This paper
   developed a modeling approach for Medium Voltage Direct Current (MVDC)
   of NG-SPS using Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) along with lithium
   ion battery and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) as an ESS and APS,
   respectively. The major objective is precise assessment of system
   dynamic behavior under various operating states in order to take full
   advantage of the system over dynamic events, effectively and keep the
   system secure. The proposed system has been simulated in MATLAB/Simulink
   and the results are presented for various operational modes.},

Abstract = {Multi-cipher and multi-mode cryptosystems are widely used for hardware
   acceleration in modern security protocols. In a session of

   can occur between sessions of communication. This paper introduces a
   multi-cipher cryptosystem (MCC) which enables a cryptosystem to use
   multiple cipher algorithms concurrently in a session of communication.
   With MCC, a file can be encrypted by different cipher algorithms with
   diverse parameters. The implementation of a sample MCC is introduced in
   this paper using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). When the number
   of cryptoprocessors in MCC meets the requirements of pipelined
   scheduling, the throughput can reach its maximum value.},

Abstract = {Software-Defined Radio (SDR) provides a flexible platform that
   facilitates radio resource management and enables new technologies and
   applications. Unfortunately, their reliance on software implementations
   makes them vulnerable to malicious software attacks that could impact
   their spectral emissions and disclose sensitive information. It is of
   critical importance for the widespread deployment of SDR to develop
   technologies that enable effective integrity assessment of
   communications platforms and timely detection of malicious intrusions.
   We provide further evidence of the feasibility of a novel approach
   called Power Fingerprinting (PFP) that enables an effective mechanism to
   perform integrity assessment of SDR. PFP relies on an external monitor
   that captures fine-grained measurements of the processor's power
   consumption and compares them against stored signatures from trusted
   software by applying pattern recognition and signal detection
   techniques. Because it is implemented by an external monitor, PFP causes
   minimal disruption on the target system and also provides the necessary
   isolation to protect against malicious attacks to the monitor itself.
   Fine-granularity measurements deliver improved visibility into the
   execution status and make the PFP monitor difficult to evade, while the
   reliance on anomaly detection from trusted references makes it effective
   against zero-day attacks. We present the results of different
   feasibility experiments that support the applicability of PFP to SDR
   integrity assessment. In the first experiment, a PFP monitor is able to
   effectively detect the execution of a tampered routine that
   misconfigures the operational mode of a PICDEM Z radio platform,
   affecting the resulting spectral emission. In a second experiment, our
   monitor effectively identifies when a transmission routine is modified,
   affecting encryption settings. We also present an approach to improve
   the performance of PFP by characterizing the way a specific platform
   consumes power. This platform characterization, which can be done using
   principal component analysis or linear discriminant analysis, allows a
   PFP monitor to work only on the features that carry the most
   information. As a result, the PFP monitor is able to detect execution
   deviations resulting from a difference of a single bit transition, the
   smallest possible disruption.},

Abstract = {Currently in home environments, robot assisting systems with emotion
   understanding ability are generally achieved in two several manners. The
   first is the implementing of such systems in such a way that they offer
   general services for all considered persons without considering privacy,
   special needs of their interaction partners. The second way is the
   targetting of such systems for merely one person. In this work we
   present a robot assisting system, which has both the abilities of
   assisting several persons at the same time and sustaining their privacy
   and security issues. The robot can interact with it's interaction
   partner emotionally by analyzing the emotions of her expressed either
   visually, facial expression, or auditive, speech prosody. The role of
   this system is the providing of person-specific support in home
   environment. In order to identify its interaction partner the system
   uses diverse biometric traits. According to the recognized ID the
   system, first, adopts towards the needs of recognized person. Second the
   system loads the corresponding emotional profile of the detected
   interaction partner in order to practice a person-specific emotional
   human-robot interaction, which has an advantage over the person
   independent interaction.},

Abstract = {In a power system with high wind power penetration, reserve allocation
   is a major problem of system planning and operation due to the
   uncertainty and fast fluctuation of wind speeds. In order to achieve
   long term sustainable solution for electricity supply, the impacts of
   the installation of wind farms on system reliability have to be
   carefully studied. This paper describes the impact of installation of
   wind farms on the system reserve and reliability from a long term
   planning point of view. A multi-state wind farm model and a multi-state
   load model are combined using universal generating function (UGF) to
   simulate the fluctuation of wind speed, reliability of wind turbine
   generators and uncertainty of load. A reliability-based hydro/thermal
   reserve allocation method is proposed to determine the conventional
   reserve required for power systems with high wind power penetration. The
   IEEE-RBTS has been modified to illustrate the applications of the
   proposed method.},

Abstract = {FUZZBUSTER is a host-based adaptive security system that automatically
   discovers, refines, and repairs vulnerabilities in hosted applications
   in order to prevent cyberattacks. FUZZBUSTER must decide when to adapt
   its applications, when to revoke its previous adaptations, and when to
   sacrifice functionality to improve security. This requires an adaptation
   quality metric that captures (1) an application's susceptibility to
   cyberattacks and (2) an application's functionality, since adapting an
   application affects both of these factors. FUZZBUSTER uses different
   types of test cases to measure security and functionality. In this
   paper, we describe FUZZBUSTER's adaptation metrics and we present two
   different policies for balancing security and functionality. We provide
   empirical results comparing these policies, and we also demonstrate how
   FUZZBUSTER can temporarily sacrifice the functionality of hosted
   applications to increase host security, and then restore functionality
   when more favorable adaptations are found.},

Abstract = {In this article, a source-grid-load-collabora tion-based control
   framework is proposed to improve the power quality of active
   distribution networks (ADNs) with high penetration of low-carbon energy.
   First, hybrid dynamics of ADNs are characterized by addressing the
   voltage regulation and operation economics in each operation mode, and
   the mode switching control is designed in line with the operation
   principle of the on-load tap changer, where voltage security events are
   used to build the event-triggered functions. Second, multiobjective
   optimization is formulated with consideration of the system-wide
   operation cost and distribution circuit loss of the ADN in a relatively
   slow time scale, while in the fast time scale, all the inverter-based
   distributed generators, energy storages, and static var compensator
   devices are coordinated at the source-load side, through which multiple
   voltage issues, including voltage profile issue and voltage increment
   issue, can be addressed in a fully distributed manner. Finally,
   simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the
   proposed method based on the modified IEEE 33-bus system.},

Abstract = {MISO faces one of the most challenging Day-ahead Security Constrained
   Unit Commitment (SCUC) problems in view of its large number of units
   (including many virtual transactions) and complicated transmission
   capacity constraints. When combined cycle units with complicated state
   transitions are present, branch-and-cut shows poor performance in terms
   of solution quality and solving times. In this paper, a synergistic
   combination of Surrogate Augmented Lagrangian Relaxation and
   branch-and-cut is presented. With system coupling constraints relaxed
   and quadratic penalties on constraint violations added, the augmented
   Lagrangian is innovatively linearized and decomposed into subproblems to
   be solved by branch-and-cut. Subproblem solutions are then effectively
   coordinated based on Surrogate subgradients with much reduced
   computation requirements and multiplier zigzagging, and accelerated
   reduction of constraint violations. Numerical testing of a complicated
   MISO SCUC case demonstrates that our method generates near-optimal
   solutions in short solving times and significantly outperforms
   branch-and-cut.},

Title = {Automatic Demand Response Method for the Energy Storage Resource System
   Based on the Blockchain Technology Combined with Sensors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAR 29},
Abstract = {In order to improve the efficiency of the automatic demand response of
   the energy storage resource system, a user authentication and key
   agreement scheme for wireless sensor networks based on blockchain is
   proposed. The user does not need to register with the gateway node. As
   the light node of the blockchain network, the two can directly
   authenticate each other. The user obtains the public information of the
   sensor node from the blockchain through the client and verifies its
   legitimacy. It solves the problem that the traditional wireless sensor
   network user authentication scheme cannot be applied to the distributed
   Internet of things environment and the authentication process is low in
   security and efficiency. Mode 1 is the disordered charging mode. The
   charging facility provides continuous constant power charging service
   for the connected response subject until the user leaves. If the
   response subject is full before this, the charging will stop. Mode 2 is
   the BADR operation mode under charging optimization only, that is, the
   V2G function of PEV is not considered. In this case, 0 < P-l,P-k <=
   P-l(max c). Mode 3 is the BADR operating mode with V2G functionality in
   mind. The ELN load characteristics under the above three operating modes
   are discussed, respectively. Calculate and compare with economy on both
   sides of supply and demand. The experimental results show that the
   discharge compensation coefficient will not affect mode 2. In mode 3, as
   the compensation coefficient increases (from 0.4 to 1.2 at intervals of
   0.2), the average total cost of the PEV cluster continues to decrease
   and the average total cost of the energy local network (ELN) system
   increases monotonically. Comparing the curves of the economic impact of
   the compensation coefficient on both sides of mode 2 and mode 3, it can
   be seen that the reasonable setting of the compensation coefficient is
   one of the key parameters for controlling the distribution of benefits.
   It proves that the proposed blockchain-based automated demand response
   (BADR) method can not only meet the satisfaction of energy demand but
   also coordinate the available energy storage resources in the system, so
   that the load level curve can track the output of new energy to the
   greatest extent and improve the balance between supply and demand of the
   system, which is suitable for a large-scale decentralized energy storage
   system.},

   Analysis in Power Systems},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {2017},
Abstract = {Static state security analysis (SSSA) is one of the most important
   computations to check whether a power system is in normal and secure
   operating state. It is a challenge to satisfy real-time requirements
   with CPU-based concurrent methods due to the intensive computations. A
   sensitivity analysis-based method with Graphics processing unit (GPU) is
   proposed for power systems, which can reduce calculation time by 40\%
   compared to the execution on a 4-core CPU. The proposed method involves
   load flow analysis and sensitivity analysis. In load flow analysis,
   amultifrontal method for sparse LU factorization is explored on GPU
   through dynamic frontal task scheduling between CPU and GPU. The varying
   matrix operations during sensitivity analysis on GPU are highly
   optimized in this study. The results of performance evaluations show
   that the proposed GPU-based SSSA with optimized matrix operations can
   achieve a significant reduction in computation time.},

Abstract = {MILS (Multiple Independent Levels of Security) is a high-assurance
   architecture that protect different security levels information sharing.
   In order to provide guarantee for a variety of information sharing
   security, MILS allow software components that have multiple security
   levels or multiple data domain to run on a single processor. But in
   specific applications, in order to achieve multiple information
   interaction and sharing between partitions, the problem of which illegal
   authorization, unauthorized access and malicious disclosure of sensitive
   information between different levels of applications will be introduced.
   From the point of information flow control, the paper put forward a
   model and method of information flow security control strictly between
   MILS partitions based on trusted computing. We designed a model based on
   BLP and access control model of state transition strategy, the policies
   break the traditional BLP model rules ``read down, write up{''}, which
   meet the needs of the security level for subjects and objects according
   to the changes of task requirements in MILS. After analyzing, the model
   can efficaciously protect confidentiality and integrity of the sensitive

Abstract = {``Having Divided to Conquer We Must Reunite {[}to] Rule{''} {[}3].
   Decomposition of problems and systems into smaller, more manageable
   units has been at the heart of software engineering practice for
   decades. ``Separation of concerns{''} gives software engineers the
   conceptual and practical tools to focus their attention, and their
   tools, on the parts of the problem or solution to which they are best
   suited. Perhaps one of the earliest boundaries used to separate concerns
   is that which exists between hardware and software - once that boundary
   is drawn, software engineers were able to focus their attention on the
   development of software within the hardware boundaries chosen. There has
   however, been a steady erosion of such boundaries: digital and physical
   connectivity have become the norm, and increasingly such connectivity
   can be ad hoc, spontaneous, and often unplanned (perhaps best
   exemplified by the Internet of Things paradigm). Moreover, the fluid and
   disappearing boundaries between technology and people have radically
   affected social behaviours (again, perhaps well exemplified by the
   proliferation of mobile and ubiquitous computing such as wearable and
   `smart' technologies used in variety of personal and community
   settings). Such convergence between digital, physical, and social spaces
   has provided exciting opportunities for software engineers to,
   literally, `cross boundaries', and, as a result, to have an impact on
   the physical and social worlds in which the software they build will
   operate. But in this brave new world with porous boundaries, security
   engineering and privacy management challenges abound. Effective security
   depends on the ability to control access to assets protected by
   boundaries {[}2]. Effective privacy management depends on informed,
   consensual sharing of information across boundaries {[}4]. Our thesis is
   that, although increasingly invisible, and rightly so, explicit
   awareness and sometimes representation of boundaries in
   cyber-physical-social systems facilitate good old fashioned separation
   of concerns, which in turn enables more effective software engineering
   of secure, privacy-aware software {[}5, 6]. We support our thesis with
   examples from our research in adaptive security {[}7] and privacy {[}1].},

Title = {A contingency partitioning approach for preventive-corrective
   security-constrained optimal power flow computation},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) is an important tool to
   optimize power system's operating state while satisfying security
   requirements with respect to credible contingencies. As a necessary
   extension to conventional SCOPF5, the recently proposed
   preventive-corrective SCOPF (PCSCOPF) aims to achieve the best
   coordination between the preventive control (PC) and corrective control
   (CC) considering the probabilistic nature of the contingencies and the
   cost of CC as well as other binding constraints. However, PCSCOPF
   renders a large-scale, multi-stage, non-linear programming problem which
   is difficult to directly solve. This paper proposes a novel and improved
   approach to the PCSCOPF problem. We aim to partition the contingencies
   into two exclusive sets: one is secured in the PC stage and the other in
   the corrective control CC stage. The PC corresponds to an ordinary SCOPF
   model and solved by the Benders decomposition method; the CC corresponds
   to an ordinary OPF model. The optimal partitioning of the contingencies
   is determined using an evolutionary algorithm (EA). Compared with the
   existing methods, the proposed approach is advantageous in that its
   searching dimension only depends on the number of insecure
   contingencies, hence tends to lead to a much higher solution speed. The
   proposed method is verified on the IEEE 118-bus system and compared with
   other two existing methods. Simulation results show that the proposed
   method can provide high-quality solutions with much higher computation
   speed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Pre-set secret keys are generally used to encipher and decipher the
   message in communication systems, including underwater acoustic (UWA)
   systems. Communication is not secure if the keys are compromised, so we
   need to generate an adaptive shared secret key. The secret keys are
   generated adaptively using correlated channel estimation, which reckons
   on the randomness in the environment and does not require the secrecy of
   data transferred during the process. This concept is extended in UWA
   channels with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems
   and implements a protocol to generate secret keys adaptively based on
   the channel frequency response (CFR). A secret key generated from the
   CFR estimation manages the channel coding system, namely a turbo-code.
   This scheme allows to jointly performing an error control and adaptive
   coding in only one step. This scheme allows an adaptive security coding
   without change of the hardware structure of the transceiver devices. In
   our analysis, BER is used as a measure of the performance of channel
   estimation and mutual information is used as a measure of secret key
   performance.},

Title = {Research on Safe Communication Architecture for Real-Time Ethernet
   Distributed Control System},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {89821-89832},
Abstract = {With the penetration of real-time Ethernet in industry, the mechanism of
   CANopen protocol based on real-time Ethernet (COE) has been widely used
   in various distributed control systems. However, due to some defects of
   the existing COE mechanism, the functional integrity and security for
   communication could not be guaranteed. Thus, Safe-COE architecture is
   designed in this paper. First, safe communication problems in systems
   are analyzed. Then, based on the Security and Safety Modeling (SESAMO)
   method, safe building blocks for communication are designed and
   combining these building blocks with Safe-COE mechanism, a kind of
   Safe-COE communication architecture is proposed. Finally, communication
   performance is tested based on this architecture. The results show that
   based on the general Ethernet MII bus interface, the minimum
   communication cycle could reach 125 mu s, and the minimum
   synchronization accuracy of peripherals control could be about 100 ns.
   Moreover, the formal modeling method is used to verify the safe
   integrity of this architecture. The results show that the architecture
   could meet related safe requirements of attack protection, data
   validation, disconnect monitoring, and state switching. Currently, there
   is no safe communication architecture for a distributed control system
   that could fully meet related standards and consider both functional
   safety and information security. It could provide a theoretical basis
   and solution for safe communication in the distributed control system.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {30},
Pages = {46-63},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Designing distributed protocols is complex and requires actions at very
   different levels: from the design of an interaction flow supporting the
   desired application-specific guarantees to the selection of the most
   appropriate network-level protection mechanisms. To tame this
   complexity, we propose AnBx, a formal protocol specification language
   based on the popular Alice \& Bob notation. AnBx offers channels as the
   main abstraction for communication, providing different authenticity
   and/or confidentiality guarantees for message transmission. AnBx extends
   existing proposals in the literature with a novel notion of forwarding
   channels, enforcing specific security guarantees from the message
   originator to the final recipient along a number of intermediate
   forwarding agents. We give a formal semantics of AnBx in terms of a
   state transition system expressed in the AVISPA Intermediate Format. We
   devise an ideal channel model and a possible cryptographic
   implementation, and we show that, under mild restrictions, the two
   representations coincide, thus making AnBx amenable to automated
   verification with different tools. We demonstrate the benefits of the
   declarative specification style distinctive of AnBx by revisiting the
   design of two existing e-payment protocols: iKP and SET. (C) 2016

   considered in isolation on a single-packet basis, can disrupt the

   states. The proposed firewall detects these complex attacks thanks to an
   internal representation of the controlled SCADA system. Furthermore, we
   detail the design of the architecture of the firewall for systems that
   use the ModBus and DNP3 protocols, and the implementation of a
   prototype, providing experimental comparative results that confirm the

Abstract = {In current society, reliable identification and verification of
   individuals are becoming more and more necessary tasks for many fields,
   not only in police environment, but also in civilian applications, such
   as access control or financial transactions. Biometric systems are used
   nowadays in these fields, offering greater convenience and several
   advantages over traditional security methods based on something that you
   know (password) or something that you have (keys). In this paper, we
   propose an efficient online personal identification system based on
   Multi-Spectral Palmprint (MSP) images using Contourlet Transform (CT)
   and Gabor Filter (GF) response. In this study, the spectrum image is
   characterized by the contourlet coefficients sub-bands. Then, we use the
   Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for modeling the observation vector. In
   addition, the same spectrum is filtered by the Gabor filter. The real
   and imaginary responses of the filtering image are used to create
   another observation vector. Subsequently, the two sub-systems are
   integrated in order to construct an efficient multi-modal identification
   system based on matching score level fusion. Our experimental results
   show the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method, which
   brings both high identification and accuracy rate.},

   power systems against wind power variation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {117},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The penetration of high-level wind power has significantly made the
   power system's operation complicated. The random power variation of the
   wind farms may deteriorate the power system's transient stability degree
   since it alters the operating state of the power system. In this paper,
   based on trajectory sensitivity and Extended Equal Area Criterion (EEAC)
   method, a new preventive control approach is proposed to optimally
   balance the wind power variation by rescheduling synchronous generators
   while maintaining the transient stability for credible contingencies.
   The whole problem is formulated to a programming problem with linear
   stabilization constraints. The proposed method is validated on the
   New-England 10-machine 39-bus system by using commercial simulation
   software Transient Security Assessment Tool (TSAT), and both single- and
   multiple-contingency cases are tested. Simulation results verify its
   satisfactory performance on control effectiveness, computational
   efficiency, transparency, and accuracy.},

Abstract = {Protocol reverse engineering, the process of (re)constructing the
   protocol context of communication sessions by an implementation, which
   involves translating a sequence of packets into protocol messages,
   grouping them into sessions, and modeling state transitions in the
   protocol state machine, is well-known to be invaluable for many network
   security applications, including intrusion prevention and detection,
   traffic normalization, and penetration testing, etc. However, current
   practice in deriving protocol specifications is either mostly manual or
   focusing on automatic reverse engineering the message format only and
   leaving the protocol state machine inverse undone. Although regular
   expressions offer superior expressive ability and flexibility,
   application protocols are described by regular expression manually based
   on sufficiently understanding protocol itself. At present there is not
   an effect method to realize classification, recognition and control
   automatically for the known applications and the unknown applications in
   future. In this paper a novel approach is presented to model network
   application specification. In this work, the whole automatic protocol
   reverse engineering is realized through accomplishing the protocol state
   machine, and then the FSMs are translated to corresponding regular
   expressions to enrich and update the pattern database. This approach
   uses grammatical inference and is motivated by the observation that an
   implementation of the protocol is inherently a state transition process,
   the state machine model the essence exactly. The important significance
   is to describe various state protocols with a common method through
   modeling the protocol state transition, including known and unknown
   ones. This approach had been implemented in the system and evaluated
   using real-world implementations of three different protocols: HTTP,
   SMTP, FTP, and compared the extracted protocol to the corresponding
   other newly system, such as 17-filter.},

Abstract = {This paper revisits Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE),
   allowing delegation of keys, traceability of compromised keys, and key
   anonymity, as additional properties.
   Whereas delegation of rights has been addressed in the seminal paper by
   Goyal et al. in 2006, introducing KP-ABE, this feature has almost been
   neglected in all subsequent works in favor of better security levels.
   However, in multi-device scenarios, this is quite important to allow
   users to independently authorize their own devices, and thus to delegate
   their initial rights with possibly more restrictions to their
   everyday-use devices. But then, one may also require tracing
   capabilities in case of corrupted devices and anonymity for the users
   and their devices.
   To this aim, we define a new variant of KP-ABE including delegation,
   with switchable attributes, in both the ciphertexts and the keys, and
   new indistinguishability properties. We then provide a concrete and
   efficient instantiation with adaptive security under the sole SXDH
   assumption in the standard model. We eventually explain how this new
   primitive can address all our initial goals.},

Abstract = {Cybersecurity attacks, which have many business impacts, continuously
   become more intelligent and complex. These attacks take the form of a
   combination of various attack elements. APT attacks reflect this
   characteristic well. To defend against APT attacks, organizations should
   sufficiently understand these attacks based on the attack elements and
   their relations and actively defend against these attacks in multiple
   dimensions. Most organizations perform risk management to manage their
   information security. Generally, they use the information system risk
   assessment (ISRA). However, the method has difficulties supporting
   sufficiently analyzing security risks and actively responding to these
   attacks due to the limitations of asset-driven qualitative evaluation
   activities. In this paper, we propose a threat-driven risk assessment
   method. This method can evaluate how dangerous APT attacks are for an
   organization, analyze security risks from multiple perspectives, and
   support establishing an adaptive security strategy.},

Abstract = {Safe operation control systems are the most important aspect of medical
   device development apart from the machine's function itself. Due to the
   fact that machines are used on people, how people can protect themselves
   from intelligent/programmed automatic or semiautomatic operating systems

   medical potential, lightweight nature and underlying Internet of Things
   (IoT) device properties. Massage robots are currently going into
   development in clinical trials. Handheld system interruption equipment
   and the robot's physical characteristics can help people achieve
   harmless use. In this paper, we systematically test the safety of a
   massage robot in an entirely real-world setting. This paper focusses on
   safe control operations in order to keep exploring the most reasonable
   safe operating modes and interrupt modes for medical devices, as well as
   the security interrupt priority.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing is now a widespread and economical option when data
   owners need to outsource or share their data. Designing secure and
   efficient data access control mechanism is one of the most challenging
   issues in cloud storage service. Anonymous broadcast encryption is a
   promising solution for its advantages in the respects of computation
   cost and communication overload. We bring forward an efficient anonymous
   identity-based broadcast encryption construction combined its
   application to the data access control mechanism in cloud storage
   service. The lengths for public parameters, user private key and
   ciphertext in the proposed scheme are all constant. Compared with the
   existing schemes, in terms of encrypting and decrypting computation
   cost, the construction of our scheme is more efficient. Furthermore, the
   proposed scheme is proved to achieve adaptive security against
   chosen-ciphertext attack adversaries in the standard model. Therefore,
   the proposed scheme is feasible for the system of data access control in
   cloud storage service.},

Abstract = {Attacks on the networks are most important issues. Therefore, the
   prevention of such attacks is imperative. The hindrance of such attacks
   is exclusively dependent on their detection. The detection is a prime
   part of any security tool such as Intrusion Detection System (IDS),
   Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Adaptive Security Alliance (ASA),
   check points and firewalls. A variety of intrusion detection approaches
   be present to resolve this severe issue but the main problem is
   performance. Therefore, in this paper, a model is proposed to overcome
   performance issues. In this model, support vector machine (SVM) and
   backpropagation neural network are applied on distributed denial of
   service (DDOS) attacks. The system uses sampled data form cooperative
   association for internet data analysis (CAIDA) dataset, an attack
   database that is a standard for evaluating the security detection
   mechanisms. The results and comparative studies indicate that the
   proposed mechanism demonstrate more accuracy in case of false positive,
   false negative and detection rate.},

Abstract = {As wireless network usage thrivingly grows, MAC address spoofing
   recently poses a serious security threat to a public wireless network.
   In the past, several schemes have been proposed to leverage this
   problem. However, these previous methods incur high deployment costs in
   employing countermeasure protocols. In this paper, we present a
   lightweight agent-based access control framework to counter MAC address
   spoofing threats. The proposed framework has four operating modes to run
   according to user needs of system performance and wireless security.
   Thereti)re, the framework provides much more flexibility in employing a
   variety of security protocols, and performance-security trade-offs. With
   a prototype implementation, the preliminary experimental results
   indicate that the proposed framework has only 20\% performance
   degradation in burst packet transfer under the most rigorous security
   consideration, which shows the potential feasibility.},

Abstract = {The industrial control systems face cybersecurity problems due to the
   connection with internets, and the cyber-attacks arc targeting
   industrial controllers: Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). To
   maintain the availability of the control system, the availability of
   anomaly detection itself is important. This paper considers a
   third-party monitoring system with multiple anomaly detection functions.
   The third monitoring system devotes control systems to control
   operations instated of security operations. Also, when a control system
   is subjected to a high-level cyberattack which loses control and
   security functions, it is expected that the multiple detection functions
   allow the operator to detect the abnormality earlier. Our proposed
   system uses two redundant PLCs for sequence control, and one of them is
   for normal operation, and the other one is for anomaly detection. They
   operate in conjunction, and when the cyberattacked PLC deviates from the
   normal operation, the anomaly detection PLC turns on the LED to make it
   easier to recognize visually, and determines that it is an anomaly. The
   cyberattack detection method is that the anomaly detection PLC always
   holds the normal state transition information of the control PLC, and
   the former PLC always monitors that of the latter PLC. Only when an
   abnormality occurs, the former PLC detects it as an abnormality. The
   display method of the detection way is shown by using three types of
   LEDs. By LEDs turning on or off, the operator can recognize which status
   is abnormal. The LED lighting state is shown in the state transition
   diagram, and we explain the superiority of the third-party monitoring
   system incorporating multiple detection methods.},

Title = {Broadband terahertz-power extracting by using electron cyclotron maser},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {7},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Terahertz applications urgently require high performance and room
   temperature terahertz sources. The gyrotron based on the principle of
   electron cyclotron maser is able to generate watt-to-megawatt level
   terahertz radiation, and becomes an exceptional role in the frontiers of
   energy, security and biomedicine. However, in normal conditions, a
   terahertz gyrotron could generate terahertz radiation with high
   efficiency on a single frequency or with low efficiency in a relatively
   narrow tuning band. Here a frequency tuning scheme for the terahertz
   gyrotron utilizing sequentially switching among several
   whispering-gallery modes is proposed to reach high performance with
   broadband, coherence and high power simultaneously. Such mode-switching
   gyrotron has the potential of generating broadband radiation with
   100-GHz-level bandwidth. Even wider bandwidth is limited by the
   frequency-dependent effective electrical length of the cavity.
   Preliminary investigation applies a pre-bunched circuit to the
   single-mode wide-band tuning. Then, more broadband sweeping is produced
   by mode switching in great-range magnetic tuning. The effect of mode
   competition, as well as critical engineering techniques on frequency
   tuning is discussed to confirm the feasibility for the case close to
   reality. This multi-modeswitching scheme could make gyrotron a promising
   device towards bridging the so-called terahertz gap.},

Abstract = {Binary tree encryption is an intriguing primitive that enables many
   practical applications to achieve an increasing important security
   feature, forward security. However, the public key size of existing
   constructions grows linearly with the depth of the underlying binary
   tree in the standard model. To support more secret keys associated with
   nodes, it is often expected that the tree has a sufficiently large
   depth. This places a burden on employing it implicitly or explicitly in
   real world. In this work, we show how to compress linear-size public key
   down to constant-size public key and give our construction featuring
   constant-size public key in the standard model. We prove that our
   construction achieves an improved security, adaptive security, under the
   matrix decision Diffie-Hellman assumption, which is a generalization of
   standard k-Lin assumption. Moreover, our key-generation, key-derivation
   and encryption algorithms have lower time complexity than that of the
   prior construction, leading to further efficiency improvements. To
   illustrate these improvements in practice, we give an implementation of
   our construction and the prior one and then evaluate the performance in
   the tree depth.},

Title = {A Cloud-Assisted Malware Detection and Suppression Framework for

Abstract = {As a novel dynamic network service infrastructure, Internet of Things
   (IoT) has gained remarkable popularity with obvious superiorities in the
   interoperability and real-time communication. Despite of the convenience
   in collecting information to provide the decision basis for the users,
   the vulnerability of embedded sensor nodes in multimedia devices makes
   the malware propagation a growing serious problem, which would harm the
   security of devices and their users financially and physically in
   wireless multimedia system (WMS). Therefore, many researches related to
   the malware propagation and suppression have been proposed to protect
   the topology and system security of wireless multimedia network. In
   these studies, the epidemic model is of great significance to the
   analysis of malware propagation. Considering the cloud and state
   transition of sensor nodes, a cloud-assisted model for malware detection
   and the dynamic differential game against malware propagation are
   proposed in this paper. Firstly, a SVM based malware detection model is
   constructed with the data sharing at the security platform in the cloud.
   Then the number of malware-infected nodes with physical infectivity to
   susceptible nodes is calculated precisely based on the attributes of WMS
   transmission. Then the state transition among WMS devices is defined by
   the modified epidemic model. Furthermore, a dynamic differential game
   and target cost function are successively derived for the Nash
   equilibrium between malware and WMS system. On this basis, a
   saddle-point malware detection and suppression algorithm is presented
   depending on the modified epidemic model and the computation of optimal
   strategies. Numerical results and comparisons show that the proposed
   algorithm can increase the utility of WMS efficiently and effectively.},

Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {The development and performance of quantum technologies heavily relies
   on the properties of the quantum states, which often require careful
   optimization of the driving conditions of all underlying com-ponents. In
   quantum key distribution (QKD), optical injection locking (OIL) of
   pulsed lasers has recently been shown as a promising technique to
   realize high-speed quantum transmitters with efficient system design.
   However, due to the complex underlying laser dynamics, tuning such laser
   system is both a chal-lenging and time-consuming task. Here, we
   experimentally demonstrate an OIL-based QKD transmitter that can be
   automatically tuned to its optimum operating state by employing a
   genetic algorithm. Starting with minimal knowledge of the laser
   operating parameters, the phase coherence and the quantum bit error rate
   of the system are optimized autonomously to a level matching the state
   of the art.},

Abstract = {Biometric system using face recognition is the frontier of the security
   across various applications in the fields of multimedia, medicine,
   civilian surveillance, robotics, etc. Differences in illumination
   levels, pose variations, eye-wear, facial hair, aging and disguise are
   some of the current challenges in face recognition. The ear, which is
   turning out to be a promising biometric identifier having some desirable
   properties such as universality, uniqueness, permanence, can also be
   used along with face for better performance of the system. A multi-modal
   biometric system combining 2D face, 3D face (depth image) and ear
   modalities using Microsoft Kinect and Webcam is proposed to address
   these challenges to some extent. Also avoiding redundancy in the
   extracted features for better processing speed is another challenge in
   designing the system. After careful survey of the existing algorithms
   applied to 2D face, 3D face and ear data, we focus on the well-known PCA
   (Principal Component Analysis) based Eigen Faces algorithm for ear and
   face recognition to obtain a better performance with minimal
   computational requirements. The resulting proposed system turns out
   insensitive to lighting conditions, pose variations, aging and can
   completely replace the current recognition systems economically and
   provide a better security. A total of 109 subjects participated in
   diversified data acquisition sessions involving multiple poses,
   illuminations, eyewear and persons from different age groups. The
   dataset is also a first attempt on the stated combination of biometrics
   and is a contribution to the field of Biometrics by itself for future
   experiments. The results are obtained separately against each biometric
   and final decision is obtained using all the individual results for
   higher accuracy. The proposed system performed at 98.165 \% verification
   rate which is greater than either of the dual combinations or each of
   the stated modality in a statistical and significant manner.},

   (UEP) approximation, and the Potential Energy Boundary Surface (PEBS)
   concepts. Then analytical parameter-space boundaries are constructed
   using polynomial regression model with optimal fit coefficients in least

   give information about critical clearing times for different faults and
   operating states, and are suitable as an on-line tool for transient

Abstract = {Broadcast encryption is an effective way to broadcast a message securely
   such that more than one privileged receiver can decrypt it. The
   well-known constructions of identity-based broadcast encryption only
   support bounded broadcast users that had to deploy the maximum user
   number in advance. This is somewhat inefficient and impractical if the
   broadcast user number is predetermined. In this paper, we propose an
   adaptively secure identity-based broadcast encryption in the standard
   model that supports arbitrary number of users in broadcast set, which
   eliminates the size of public parameters with a constant number of group
   elements O(1) and obtain short ciphertexts, secret keys, and public
   parameters. We use the techniques of semi-functional ciphertexts and
   semi-functional keys in orthogonal subgroups to implement the boundless
   broadcast set and adaptive security by means of dual-system encryption
   mechanism in a composite-order group, and we prove the scheme to be
   fully secure without the random oracles in the static assumptions. The
   proposed scheme captures the properties of confidentiality, adaptive
   security, constant key, and short ciphertext. We also evaluate the
   computational costs and communication overheads and give the deployment
   in secure set-top box broadcast systems. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley

Abstract = {Modern System-on-Chip (SoC) designs rely heavily on reusable, verified
   and bug-free hardware Intellectual Property (IP) cores. Recent trends of
   IP piracy and reverse-engineering are causing major revenue loss to the
   IP vendors. A large majority of hardware H's comes in Register Transfer
   Level (RTL) description due to their portability and flexibility to map
   to any technology platform. In this paper, we propose a key-based
   security through obscurity approach for protecting RTL hardware IPs. The
   RTL design is first transformed into a technology-independent gate-level
   description and The functionality of the resulting gate-level netlist is
   then changed through modification of its state transition function. This
   process allows normal operation only on the successful application of a
   correct initialization sequence. The modified gate-level design is then
   decompiled to generate an obfuscated version of the RTL. Major RTL
   constructs and macros are optionally preserved through the
   transformation process using a forward annotation file. The proposed
   methodology differs from existing hardware obfuscation as well as
   watermarking techniques in its ability to achieve simultaneous
   functional and semantic obfuscation for RTL description of IP at low
   design overhead. Simulation results for a set of open-source IP cores
   show that we can achieve high levels of security through a
   well-formulated obfuscation scheme incurring nominal area, delay and
   power overhead.},

Title = {An Effective Multi-Mode Iris Authentication System on a
   Microprocessor-FPGA Heterogeneous Platform With QC-LDPC Codes},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {163665-163674},
Abstract = {With the emergence and popularity of iris biometrics, there are
   increasing concerns regarding the feasibility of iris authentication
   systems and their corresponding variability reduction methods. The
   former issues are typically addressed by optimizing key factors, such as
   iris size, image quality and acquisition wavelength. As for the latter,
   introducing error correction codes to reduce intra-user variability in
   the enrolled identifiers becomes novelly promising. This paper proposes
   a conventional iris authentication system and a hardware-friendly
   QC-LDPC error correction code scheme on a microprocessor-FPGA platform.
   Different QC-LDPC codes in IEEE 802.16e were analyzed and selected.
   Suitable codes were applied, followed by the evaluation experiments. The
   proposed design achieves a competitive result with up to 0.20\% EER and
   0.50\% ZeroFAR on the CASIA-IrisV4-Syn database. Cryptographic keys with
   lengths of up to 288 bits can also be generated and recovered. Such a
   device can be potentially used for applications such as an access
   control system in high-security areas, identity verification at the
   borders, biometric cryptography and related authentication scenarios.},

Title = {Accurate, simultaneous and Real-Time screening of N-1, N-k, and N-1-1
   contingencies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Generally, in contingency analysis, N-1 events are studied. However,
   simultaneous failure of more than one device is more dangerous and might
   result in cascading failures. Due to cyber-attacks and malicious
   motivations, attacking several components of the system is more
   probable. Various methods have been proposed for contingency screening,
   which are mainly time-consuming and cannot be applied to real systems.
   On the other hand, there is no integrated algorithm for screening N-1,
   N-k, and N-1-1 contingencies. In this paper, an indirect method has been
   presented for this purpose. The proposed method extracts different
   critical contingencies through screening contingencies in offline mode
   for some selected operating modes. Then, they are clustered using the
   Gaussian-mixture model using the expectation-maximization algorithm.
   Therefore, the boundary between data is specified, which helps to find
   the closest (the most similar) operating modes. In online mode, the
   critical contingencies of the closest trained data are introduced as the
   critical contingency set of the present operating point. To the best of
   our knowledge, this study employs the correlation between the loads and
   generators in contingency screening for the first time. The proposed
   method outperforms the existing methods in terms of simplicity,
   accuracy, and speed such that it detects contingencies with the maximum
   accuracy of 100\% without imposing any additional computational load.},

Abstract = {In the last couple of years, it has become obvious that embedded systems
   are integral parts of our every day lives. This omnipresence as well as
   the wireless nature of many embedded applications give rise to the need
   for sophisticated security and privacy preserving mechanisms. Trusted
   Computing is a promising new approach for computer security in which a
   system should be permanently in a well-defined and therefore trustworthy
   state. The adaption of such concepts for embedded systems with
   application specific requirements and limitations can provide promising
   security benefits. Besides, both in the industrial and academical sector
   a trend has become apparent to develop chips which include programmable
   cores as well as system reconfigurable components. Resultant chips will
   not be a single part of an embedded system anymore but rather can be
   used for the development of a whole system. Thus, FPGAs have become
   integral parts of embedded computing platforms. The reconfigurability of
   FPGAs offers major advantages when using them for cryptographic
   applications and it is suggested that an adaptive hardware-based trust
   anchor can greatly enhance the overall security level of an embedded
   system. In this paper we propose a concept of how such an adaptive
   security module could be designed as well as some possible fields of
   application. A key focus of this ongoing research work is the
   development of a flexible FPGA-based security architecture.},

Abstract = {The rise of WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) and widely adopted WSN
   services on environmental monitoring make our lives safer. To bring
   higher level of intelligent services into lives, integration of various
   networking services in one area is a must. For example, in traditional
   security camera system, object stolen event is only handled as a post
   processing service. But, if we integrate WSN positioning service with
   intelligent cameras, it is possible to differentiate the object stolen
   event from the authorized moving event in real time, thus reduce false
   alarm dramatically. And also it is possible to notify a nearest security
   guard to handle the event if it is decided not an authorized moving
   event. We developed a multi-modal surveillance system by integrating
   WSN, ZigBee positioning, audio and video event defection over
   cooperative sensor network to provide useful services. With the
   cooperation of different sensors, our system will keep our lives more
   secure. by only signaling true event that needs to be handled.},

   approach to combat problems of unimodal biometric system such as

   cancelable biometric or cancelability is to transform a biometric data
   or feature into a new one so that the stored biometric template can be
   easily changed in a biometric security system. In this paper, we present
   a novel architecture for template generation within the context of the
   cancelable multimodal system. We develop a novel cancelable biometric

   transformation-based feature extraction and selection. We further
   validate the performance of the proposed algorithm on a virtual multi

Abstract = {In the aerospace industry, there is an increased demand for a new kind
   of avionic architecture, in order to reduce cost, weight, number of
   components, certification, installation and maintenance complexity,
   while improving the security, compatibility and RF efficiency. The key
   solution to achieve this goal is to integrate multiple avionic systems,
   apply new signal processing and RF capabilities. A generalized and
   reconfigurable architecture of Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) with integrated
   and modularised structure based on Direct RF Sampling (DRFS) and
   Software Defined Radio (SDR) is presented in this paper for avionic
   applications. The proposed architecture is composed of a DRFS digital
   receiver integrated within a SDR software modules. DRFS technology is
   adopted in the digital receiver, which consists of Pre-selection Filters
   and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to provide flexible
   compatibility for diverse modulation modes and various RF/IF frequency
   bands. By employing the concept of DRFS/SDR, distinct procedures for
   different avionic purposes, such as Very High Frequency Omnidirectional
   Range (VOR) and Instrument Landing System (ILS), can be achieved in the
   same hardware platform. Notably, this proposed architecture has the
   potential to be reconfigured and improved in several ways without any
   hardware change to accommodate new features and signal capabilities. As
   per experimental validation phase, an MMR integrated system for VOR and
   ILS receivers has been designed and implemented. Test results have
   illustrated that the implementation feasibility of multi-mode DRFS
   avionic receivers is beneficial and efficient using the proposed
   architecture. Moreover, the benefits obtained from this new approach are
   not only covering miniaturization, lightweight, and low power
   consumption but is also promising to overreach the equivalent commercial
   systems in the future.},

Abstract = {This paper studies the smart control issue for large power systems to
   effectively solve the problems of security, stability, and economical
   efficiency. A control scheme called as hierarchical hybrid control is
   proposed versus the hierarchical structure and hybrid dynamics of large
   power systems. A novel hybrid model is first founded to clearly explain
   the interactive hybrid behaviors of the power systems during significant
   disturbances. On the basis of the model, the hybrid control is proposed,
   which consists of upper level control strategies (including logic
   control commands for discrete events and energy management strategies)
   and lower level continuous controls for component units. The upper level
   control strategies are responsible for switching operating modes for the
   purpose of security operation following a significant disturbance, as
   well as power assignment for the economical efficiency of operation, and
   the lower level continuous controllers are responsible for regulating
   dynamic stability of the systems. The effectiveness of the proposed
   hybrid control is demonstrated through simulation examples.},

Abstract = {Millions of smart phones are run by Android, the most common operating
   system for mobile devices. Main component of Android is applications
   providing most functionalities of Android smart devices. These
   applications include e-mail client, entertainment, educational, news,
   banking, maps, and contacts applications. Testing and verifying Android
   applications is an important direction of research.
   This paper presents a separation logic for state transitions of
   activities and fragments (important components of applications) during
   their life cycles. The logic considers the necessary coordinations
   between the state transitions in the two life cycles. The logic is a
   good tool to verify and test applications against various issues

Abstract = {Having timely and credible security information is becoming critical to
   network and security management. Most current sources of threat
   information and detection techniques suffer from having a limited view
   of the global threat scenario. In this paper, we present Foresight, an
   internet scale threat analysis, indication, early warning and response
   architecture. We describe the design of an incentive based cooperation
   scheme to create a global trusted community which is more accountable
   and hence less vulnerable to attacks and abuse. Foresight utilizes this
   infrastructure to share a global threat view in order to detect unknown
   threats and isolate them. We describe a novel behavioral signature
   scheme to extract a generalized footprint for multi-modal threats.
   System performance analysis through trace-based simulations show
   significant benefits for sharing forensics across cooperating domains.},

Abstract = {Proving security of Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption (HIBE) and
   Attribution Based Encryption scheme is a challenging problem. There are
   multiple well-known schemes in the literature where the best known
   (adaptive) security proofs degrade exponentially in the maximum
   hierarchy depth. However, we do not have a rigorous understanding of why
   better proofs are not known. (For ABE, the analog of hierarchy depth is
   the maximum number of attributes used in a ciphertext.)
   In this work, we define a certain commonly found checkability property
   on ciphertexts and private keys. Roughly the property states that any
   two different private keys that are both ``supposed to{''} decrypt a
   ciphertext will decrypt it to the same message. We show that any simple
   black box reduction to a non-interactive assumption for a HIBE or ABE
   system that contains this property will suffer an exponential
   degradation of security.},

Abstract = {As fraud and cybercrime become more frequent and sophisticated,
   preventing users from being exposed to risk is a significant challenge
   for the scientific community. Current banking systems use One Time
   Password (OTP) sent to the mobile phone to prevent user impersonation
   attacks. However, it could be compromised by man-in-the-middle attacks.
   It also presents usability and unavailability problems if the SMS
   service is inaccessible, especially when traveling or in case of a
   damaged or stolen phone. Using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to
   detect and prevent fraudulent actions allows financial organizations to
   stay one step ahead of fraudsters, whose scale and sophistication
   continue to grow. Specifically, ML systems can be used to identify
   additional authentication factors to make the system more robust against
   attacks. To prevent identity theft attacks and minimize fraudulent
   transactions, we propose in this work a comprehensive design that
   combines adaptive multi-factor authentication and adaptive fraud
   detection for banking systems based on the use of ML technology.},

   missing measurements using surrogate-splits ensembles for real-time
   voltage stability assessment comprising of the classification of the
   operating state of the power system, and the prediction of the power

   Boosting and Bagging machine learning methods in the design of the
   ensemble models required for the classification and regression tasks,
   respectively, based on the feature attributes obtained from
   synchrophasor measurements. The performance of the trained classifiers
   and regressors was evaluated for the case of missing phasor measurement
   unit (PMU) measurements. Robust classifier and regressor models immune
   to missing PMU measurements were afterwards developed using the
   surrogate-splits technique. The validity of the proposed approach was
   tested using the New England 39-bus test system. The experimental
   results obtained validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for
   various operating scenarios and contingencies even in the presence of

Abstract = {Situation awareness is a key factor in preserving power system security,
   as it enables effective and timely decision-making and reactions by the
   operators to an incident. Insufficient situation awareness results in a
   delayed, incorrect or deficient response, endangering power system
   stability. This factor was actually identified as one of the main causes
   of several electrical disturbances in the last decade. This paper
   identifies numerous factors that govern the formation of situation
   awareness in a power system control center. A multi-state model based on
   Markov modeling is proposed for assessing the impact of insufficient
   situation awareness on the probability of power system blackouts. The
   proposed model considers the level of situation awareness and the state
   of the information infrastructure. The workings of this model are
   illustrated using the IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System.},

Abstract = {Internet and computer networks are facing an increasing number of
   security threats. With new types of attacks that appear continuously,
   the development of flexible and adaptive security is a serious
   challenge. In this field, approaches of network-based intrusion
   detection are ideal techniques to protect target systems and networks
   from destructive actions. Depending on the analytical model, this
   technique is divided into signature-based and anomaly-based models.
   Signature-based model focuses on known attacks or their obvious features
   by matching patterns of behavior with a predefined byte string. The
   biggest problem with this model is that it is not able to detect new
   attacks if the software does not have their signatures defined in the
   database. Anomaly-based model specifies normal behavior of the traffic
   and computes unusual degree of one packet on base of its deviance
   measure from normal behavior. Even then if diversion is discovered, the
   system would generate alarms indicating a series of intrusion events
   that have occurred. Despite the ability of this system to detect new
   attacks, it generates a high rate of false alarms. Shimamura and Kono
   (2006) in order to reduce false alarms rate in the signature-based IDS
   proposed a system called TrueAlarm. Although this proposed system can be
   considered as a new system of network-based intrusion detection due to
   its benefits than basic NIDS, it is important to note that TrueAlarm
   still cannot identify unknown suspicious messages as the signature-based
   NIDS, and this is its biggest weakness due to the large volume of
   network attacks in today's world that include many zero-day attacks. In
   this article whilst we want to introduce intrusion detection system as a
   powerful tool in the field of network security, and also a variety of
   analysis techniques and models, using a basic system namely TrueAlarm,
   we present a new architecture namely Integrated TrueAlarm to improve the
   false alarm problem of anomaly-based analysis model.},

Abstract = {We propose a key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) scheme with
   constant-size ciphertexts, whose almost tightly semi-adaptive security
   is proven under the decisional linear (DLIN) assumption in the standard
   model. The access structure is expressive, that is given by non-monotone
   span programs. It also has fast decryption, i.e., a decryption includes
   only a constant number of pairing operations. As an application of our
   KP-ABE construction, we also propose an efficient, fully secure
   attribute-based signatures with constant-size secret (signing) keys from
   the DLIN. For achieving the above results, we extend the sparse matrix
   technique on dual pairing vector spaces. In particular, several
   algebraic properties of an elaborately chosen sparse matrix group are
   applied to the dual system security proofs.},

Abstract = {At the early stage of the design process, many security vulnerability
   assessment solutions require fast and precise extraction of the finite
   state machines (FSMs) present in the register-transfer level (RTL)
   description of the design. FSMs should be accurately extracted for
   watermark insertion, fault injection assessment of control paths in a
   system-on-chip (SoC), information leakage assessment, control-flow
   reverse engineering in RTL abstraction, logic obfuscation, etc. However,
   it is quite unfortunate that, as of today, existing state-of-the-art
   synthesis tools cannot provide accurate and reliable extraction of all
   FSMs from the provided high-level RTL code. Precise identification of
   all FSM state registers and the pure combinational state transition
   logic described in the RTL code with numerous registers and other
   combinational logic makes it quite challenging to develop such a
   solution. In this paper, we propose a framework named RTL-FSMx to
   extract FSMs from high-level RTL codes written in Verilog HDL. RTL-FSMx
   utilizes node-based analysis on the abstract syntax tree (AST)
   representation of the RTL code to isolate FSM state registers from other
   registers. RTLFSMx automatically extracts state transition graphs (STGs)
   for each of the detected FSM state registers and additional information
   of the extracted FSMs. Experimental results on a large number of
   benchmark circuits demonstrate that RTLFSMx accurately recovers all
   control FSMs from RTL codes with various complexity and size within just
   a few seconds.},

Abstract = {Whether it is for hunting prey, or modern racing, games, or war, how to
   accurately track the target is the key to the victory. When we can have
   a machine to help us track the target, we can naturally solve more
   problems. Not only it can be used in military applications, such as
   warplane radar and missiles but it can be applied in civilian purposes
   including home security, event broadcasting, smart home. The target
   tracking is becoming increasingly mature. In this paper, we aim to
   develop a practical three-axis target tracking system by simulating the
   hunting ability of snakes in nature, and we add thermal infrared images
   to increase the model modality and optimize the ability of existing
   Siamese tracking network Multi-Modal Machine Learning (MMML) is modified
   with the Siamese tracking network into a multi-modal fusion model, so as
   to improve the model's perception. At the same time, the Siamese
   networks models for training normal images and thermal infrared images
   are separated and a pseudo-Siamese network is used as the main framework
   to process the different the databases. This paper successfully improves
   the stability and accuracy of the model. With the embedded development
   version and three-axis servo motor, our system can be more flexible in
   tracking applications.},

Abstract = {Many authorities are investing in new infrastructure to improve the
   quality of public transport (PT) services in the hope to increase mode
   switch from cars. The goal is to provide users with an integrated
   multimodal PT network by facilitating transfers. There exists a lack in
   the clarity of the attributes which defines a planned transfer and the
   effects of planned transfers on users' willingness to use routes with
   transfers. The present study provides approximate effects of planned'
   and unplanned' transfers on PT users' decisions to use transfer routes.
   The study focuses on two attributes of planned' transfers, integrated
   physical connection of transfers and information integration. A user
   preference survey was undertaken in Auckland, New Zealand. Analysis of
   the results shows that physical integration is more important than
   information integration for current PT users. Results also suggest that
   information integration has a greater influence on users of transfer
   services which are more closely aligned to being unplanned'.},

   IoT systems with malware dissemination},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {66},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {IoT malware dissemination seriously exacerbates the decline of IoT
   system availability, which deteriorates the users experience. To address
   the issue, we first predict the optimal IoT malware dissemination
   strategy based on a signaling game for edge computing-assisted IoT
   systems. We then develop an algorithm to obtain the solution of the
   signaling IoT availability assessment game, which is to factually
   reflect IoT malware dissemination in practice and reasonably express the
   probability of IoT system nodes being successfully infected by malware.
   Thus, a state transition diagram of IoT system nodes can be further
   designed, illustrating intercommunication among all six states during
   IoT malware dissemination. Upon this state transition diagram, we
   represent the state transition probability of IoT system nodes in each
   state utilizing a Markov matrix, and attain the steady-state
   availability of an IoT system node from reliability theory.
   Consequently, we deduce metrics to access the steady-state availability
   of the entire IoT system under typical star-, tree-, and mesh
   topologies, respectively. We also design the corresponding IoT system
   availability assessment algorithm from the view of practice. In this
   manner, an availability assessment mechanism for edge computing-based
   IoT systems with malware dissemination is constructed. Experiments
   demonstrate the influence of IoT system features on predicting IoT
   malware dissemination probability and assessing the steady-state
   availability of three typical IoT system topologies. Our results can be
   utilized to lay a theoretical foundation for guiding the implementation
   of higher availability for edge computing-assisted IoT systems with
   malware dissemination.},

Abstract = {With the recent explosive growth of the market demand for RFID systems,
   design of RFID tag and reader IC has become one of the most popular
   research areas. This paper gives a review of several key issues in the
   UHF RFID tag and reader design. To achieve a higher identification
   performance, a low cost, low power RFID tag with efficient
   anti-collision technique which provides a large throughput and flexible
   security mechanism is required. Moreover, the package of tag becomes a
   bottleneck to further reduce the RFID cost. In RFID reader design, the
   carrier leakage problem is a significant challenge which limits the
   sensitivity of the RFID receiver. And in order to increase the
   integration of an RFID system, a multi-mode, high efficient CMOS PA with
   a sufficient output power is preferred to be integrated in the reader
   transceiver IC. Three design instances are given to demonstrate the
   challenges of RFID IC design.},

Abstract = {Loss of field protection is of great importance for the security of
   large-scale generators. With the development of large-scale generators
   and corresponding loss of field protection, the complicated structure
   leads to the high possibility of loss of field faults. According to the
   statistical data, more than sixty percentages of the synchronous
   generator faults are the excitation system faults, which might cause
   loss of load, tie-line tripping, instability, collapse and etc.
   Therefore, it is crucial to identify loss of field as early as possible
   and take countermeasures. In loss of field protection, the impedance
   boundary criterion of steady state stability limit is widely used to
   distinguish loss of field and normal condition. However, the steady
   state stability limit circle is affected by the system operating modes,
   which might result in mis-operation of the relay. In this paper, an
   approach for on-line identifying system equivalent impedance is
   presented based on PMU measurements. The steady state stability limit
   circle can be adaptively fit for operating modes. The computer
   simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method works well.},

Abstract = {With the development of information technology, cloud computing becomes
   a new direction of grid computing. Cloud computing is user-centric, and
   provides end users with leasing service. Guaranteeing the security of
   user data needs careful consideration before cloud computing is widely
   applied in business. Virtualization provides a new approach to solve the
   traditional security problems and can be taken as the underlying
   infrastructure of cloud computing. In this paper, we propose an
   intrusion prevention system, VMFence, in a virtualization-based cloud
   computing environment, which is used to monitor network flow and file
   integrity in real time, and provide a network defense and file integrity
   protection as well. Due to the dynamicity of the virtual machine, the
   detection process varies with the state of the virtual machine. The
   state transition of the virtual machine is described via Definite Finite
   Automata (DFA). We have implemented VMFence on an open-source virtual
   machine monitor platform-Xen. The experimental results show our proposed
   method is effective and it brings acceptable overhead.},

Abstract = {Leakage-resilient cryptography is proposed to address physical attacks
   on real world crypto-systems. Dual system encryption methodology is
   developed to guide design and analysis of various functional encryption
   schemes (FEs) with adaptive security. Observing the compatibility of
   dual system methodology and leakage-resilience, Lewko et al. present
   constructions of a number of strong leakage-resilient functional
   encryptions. In particular, they present fully secure identity-based
   encryption (IBE), hierarchical IBE (HIBE) and attribute-based encryption
   (ABE) satisfying the continual memory leakage (CML) model, one of the
   strongest models that allows continuous leakage on both user and master
   secret keys.
   Inspired by the recent work from Attrapadung on pair encodings which
   greatly simplifies the design and analysis of FE, we propose a generic
   framework for constructing fully secure FEs in the CML model (LR-FEs).
   Specifically, our framework ``compiles{''} predicate encodings into
   fully secure LR-FEs in a two-step process. Firstly, we propose a generic
   transformation of pair encoding schemes into their leakage-resilient
   forms. Next, we present another conversion that turns leakage-resilient
   pair encodings into fully secure LR-FEs. Our framework is highly
   compatible with Attrapadung's, meaning that it is applicable to many
   existing pair encoding schemes.
   The contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, our framework
   simplifies the design and analysis of LR-FEs into the design and
   analysis of predicate encodings. Secondly, our framework allows us to
   improve the security of some existing LR-FEs, such as LR-IBE with a
   tighter reduction. Thirdly, we discover new adaptively secure LR-FEs,
   including FE for regular languages, ABE for large universe and ABE with
   short ciphertext.},

Abstract = {Every year, web applications have expanded their presence in more areas
   in financial organizations, health organizations, public sector, retail
   and accommodation. Security is important in data protection so as not to
   be infringed by unauthorized parties. If the vulnerabilities found are
   not amended, it leads to cyber-attacks such as Structured Query Language
   Injection Attack (SQLIA) performed by certain parties which enable them
   to gain unauthorized data access. To cater security issues, variety of
   security frameworks for secure software development life cycle (SDLC)
   were introduced. Secure SDLC is created by integrating security-related
   activities to an each phase of in used development methodologies such as
   waterfall model or agile model. However, the application security
   problem continues to grow. Strict, complicated and heavyweight
   frameworks are underutilized due to several factors. The factors that
   influence the implementation of secure SDLC identified in public sector
   (the scope is State Secretary Offices in Malaysia) are inadequate
   development timeline, improper development team size and less awareness
   of team members' workload. It is agreed that integrating security at
   earlier (requirement and design) phase is the most effective and
   cheapest way to develop secure web application. Hence, an adaptive
   secure SDLC model is proposed to integrate security activities using
   Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) focusing on the influence
   factors as the main criteria and meet the international and local secure
   frameworks standards. The proposed model will recommend adaptive
   security activities as a guideline to be applied at earlier phases of
   SDLC to help eliminate/minimize the web application vulnerabilities and
   increase the application security and implemented as a proof-of-concept
   prototype at selected Malaysian public sector for in-house web
   application development.},

Abstract = {Consideration of uncertain injections in optimal power flow (OPF)
   calculation is increasingly important because more renewable generators,
   whose outputs are variable and intermittent, are connected into modern
   power systems. Since it is often difficult to predict the variations of
   both load and renewable generator output accurately, this paper proposes
   an OPF algorithm to make optimized results not only have a high
   probability to achieve minimized generation cost, but also robust to the
   uncertain operating states. In this paper, the objective of the OPF is
   to minimize the generation cost of the scenario which has the largest
   probability to appear in the future. In order to make the OPF result be
   able to accommodate other possible scenarios, the OPF constraints are
   modified. Considering the probabilistic distributions of both load and
   renewable energy output, the modified constraints are derived from
   Taguchi's orthogonal array testing and probabilistic power flow
   calculation. The effectiveness of the proposed OPF method is
   demonstrated by the cases up to the system with 2736 buses.},

Abstract = {Security and user privacy are areas of concern in digital transactions
   over a network. Integration of biometric pattern matching into an
   identity management system (IMS) enhances security of transactions and
   improves ease of use. Privacy of users in a biometric based system is
   improved by using keys generated directly from feature sets instead of
   conventional stored templates. This paper proposes a framework for
   integrating biometric key based authentication into an IMS. The
   generated keys need to be consistent. Consistency of keys is attained if
   the same key is generated for every instance of biometric input.
   Generation of long and consistent keys directly from feature sets poses
   a challenge due to intra and inter user variations inherent to biometric
   data. A novel methodology for generating consistent keys using
   principles of vector quantization and cluster based learning is
   introduced. 15-bit keys have been extracted from handwritten signature
   datasets. The results are promising and can be extended to multi-modal
   biometric feature sets.},

Abstract = {Biometric Authentication Systems (BAS) have several security benefits
   over traditional password and token authentication including an inherent
   difficulty to copy, clone and share or distribute authentication
   credentials (biometric traits). Spoofing or presentation attack remains
   a major weakness of biometric systems and tackling it at the trait level
   is still challenging with several different approaches and methods
   applied in existing systems. In this paper, we focus on the well-known
   approach of Suspicious Presentation Detection (SPD) and present the
   Multi-Modal Random Trait Biometric Liveness Detection System (MMRTBLDS)
   that further mitigates spoofing or presentations attacks using
   randomization and combination of several different SPD detection
   techniques across three different modalities during trait capture. We
   discuss the detection of life using five distinct properties each from
   finger, face and eye modalities and present results from a simulation
   that highlights the improved security based on an impostor's inability
   to accurately predict the combination of trait liveness properties the
   system might prompt and test for during capture.},

Abstract = {Fuzzy techniques can implement the fine-grained access control of
   encrypted data in the Cloud because they support error-tolerance. In
   this system, using biometric attributes such as fingerprints, faces and
   irises as pubic parameters is advantageous over those systems based on
   Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This is because biometric information
   is unique, unforgettable and non-transferable. However the
   biometric-attribute measurements are noisy and most of the existing
   encryption systems can not support the biometric-attribute encryption.
   Additionally, the previous fuzzy encryption schemes only achieve the
   selective security which is a weak security model. To overcome these
   drawbacks, we propose a new fuzzy encryption scheme based on the lattice
   in this letter. The proposed scheme is based on a hierarchical
   identity-based encryption with fixed-dimensional private keys space and
   thus has short public parameters and short private keys, which results
   in high computation efficiency. Furthermore, it achieves the strong
   security, i.e., adaptive security. Lastly, the security is reduced to
   the learning with errors (LWE) problem in the standard model.},

Abstract = {This paper primarily focuses on evaluation and adjustment methods for
   small signal analysis with wind farm integration. The connection of wind
   farms may affect the original oscillation modes of the system, and may
   also introduce new oscillation modes. To ensure the security and
   stability of the system, it is necessary to assess the running state of
   the system and evaluate the development direction of the small signal
   stability on the premise of taking volatility into account. It is also
   important to fast adjust the system when an unstable state happened. The
   method in this paper provides a new way to accurately evaluate and
   adjust the stability of the system integrated with wind farms. Broad
   learning system (BLS) is a non-fixed model and has the potential of
   incremental learning. A BLS model is trained to evaluate the damping
   ratio sensitivity in different operating states. The adjustment part
   will use the optimal adjustment model and damping ratio sensitivity to
   adjust unstable systems. The superior performance of the model proposed
   in this paper is tested by the case study based on the IEEE 3-machine,
   9-bus, and the New-England 10-machine, 39-bus. The results demonstrate
   the feasibility, validity, and effectiveness of the method proposed in
   this article.},

Journal = {OPTIK},

Volume = {231},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Based on the vector diffraction theory, this paper modulates the tightly
   focused Bessel beam, constructs the vector optical vortex field of
   nanoscale and studies its energy transfer characteristics. The results
   show that the topological charge number can adjust the polarization
   state of the optical vortex, and the phenomenon of multimodal optical
   vortex soliton appears. The phase parameter can cause the optical vortex
   to be angularly deflected and a certain amount of energy transfer
   occurs. The ratio of pupil radius to beam waist results in significant
   energy migration of the multi-ring optical vortex solitons. In a word,
   the three parameters proposed in this paper can change the dimension of
   optical vortex solitons and give rise to a new form of optical vortex.
   The research in this paper has a good application prospect in the fields
   of optical vortex manipulation, particle capture and multiplexing of
   high density communication system, information security and so on.},

Title = {Abnormal Behavior Learning Based on Edge Computing toward a Crowd

Abstract = {Abnormal behavior poses a great threat to social security and stability.
   The resulting violence or crime leads to terrible consequences. How to
   utilize reasonable means to predict the dangerous intentions of massive
   crowds and prevent the potential hazard to the public is significant for
   social security. A crowd monitoring and management system is an
   effective way to detect abnormal behavior. In this article, we release
   unmanned aerial vehicles as well as fixed ground devices to achieve
   multi-level and multi-modal behavioral sensing on a massive crowd,
   deploy a hybrid model in edge cloud to extract global features from
   behavioral data of a massive crowd, and then utilize these global
   features to construct decent classification algorithms for action
   recognition and behavioral semantic cognition. With the cooperation of
   behavioral data and cognitive algorithms, we can understand the
   instantaneous emotions of the crowd. On the basis of behavioral data and
   the emotional state of the crowd, the correlation between daily behavior
   and any dangerous intention of a massive crowd has been revealed by
   utilizing behavioral big data analysis, which is a key foundation for
   predicting people's dangerous intentions. Finally, we conduct a case
   study of abnormal behavior detection based on pix2pix and continuous
   video frames. The experimental results show that the performance of our
   method is better than other algorithms in both public datasets and the
   customized Hajj dataset. The proposed novel pattern for the effective
   learning of a massive crowd is validated to effectively eliminate some
   of the possible dangers caused by abnormal behavior.},

Abstract = {In functional encryption (FE) schemes, ciphertexts and private keys are
   associated with attributes and decryption is possible whenever key and
   ciphertext attributes are suitably related. It is known that expressive
   realizations can be obtained from a simple FE flavor called inner
   product encryption (IPE), where decryption is allowed whenever
   ciphertext and key attributes form orthogonal vectors. In this paper, we
   construct (non-anonymous) IPE systems with constant-size ciphertexts for
   the zero and non-zero evaluations of inner products. These schemes
   respectively imply an adaptively secure identity-based broadcast
   encryption scheme and an identity-based revocation mechanism that both
   feature short ciphertexts and rely on simple assumptions in prime order
   groups. We also introduce the notion of negated spatial encryption,
   which subsumes non-zero-mode IPE and can be seen as the revocation
   analogue of the spatial encryption primitive of Boneh and Hamburg.},

Abstract = {We have developed a flexible, target-driven, multi-modal, physics-based
   fusion architecture that efficiently searches sensor detections for
   targets and rejects clutter while controlling the combinatoric problems
   that commonly arise in data-driven fusion systems. The informational
   constraints imposed by long lifetime requirements make systems
   vulnerable to false alarms. We demonstrate that our data fusion system
   significantly reduces false alarms while maintaining high sensitivity to
   threats. In addition, mission goals can vary substantially in terms of
   targets-of-interest, required characterization, acceptable latency, and
   false alarm rates. Our fusion architecture provides the flexibility to
   match these trade-offs with mission requirements unlike many
   conventional systems that require significant modifications for each new
   mission.
   We illustrate our data fusion performance with case studies that span
   many of the potential mission scenarios including border surveillance,
   base security, and infrastructure protection. In these studies, we
   deployed multi-modal sensor nodes - including geophones, magnetometers,
   accelerometers and PIR sensors - with low-power processing algorithms
   and low-bandwidth wireless mesh networking to create networks capable of
   multi-year operation. The results show our data fusion architecture
   maintains high sensitivities while suppressing most false alarms for a
   variety of environments and targets.},

Title = {Data-driven modeling of the temporal evolution of breakers' states in
   the French electrical transmission grid?},
Journal = {NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {46},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In electrical transmission grids, it is common to observe the states of
   circuit breakers. While they are known at irregular times, system
   modeling and grid state estimation are of the highest importance to
   ensure secure operations. This paper proposes a richer method to
   estimate the grid state over its reference configurations based on the
   temporal evolution of its breakers' states. The first contribution
   consists in developing a general multi-observation continuous-time
   finite-state Hidden Markov Model with filter-based parameter estimation
   to infer the hidden state (e.g., the grid reference configuration)
   handling multiple observed processes with irregular `'jump{''}times
   (e.g., the breakers' states). As a second contribution, we build a
   numerical scheme with no discretization error adapted to all state jumps
   generated by the observed processes. Finally, we apply our model to
   simulated and real data to illustrate the approach's performance. The
   available data consists of historical records of breakers' states during
   the electrical transmission grid operated normally. For this
   real-data-driven application, we also present a clustering approach to
   identify the set of grid reference configurations. (c) 2022 Elsevier

Abstract = {Automatic optimal response systems are essential for preserving power
   system resilience and ensuring faster recovery from emergency under
   cyber compromise. Numerous research works have developed such response
   engine for cyber and physical system recovery separately. In this paper,
   we propose a novel cyber-physical decision support system, SCORE, that
   computes optimal actions considering pure and hybrid cyber-physical
   states, using Markov Decision Process (MDP). Such an automatic decision
   making engine can assist power system operators and network
   administrators to make a faster response to prevent cascading failures
   and attack escalation respectively. The hybrid nature of the engine
   makes the reward and state transition model of the MDP unique. Value
   iteration and policy iteration techniques are used to compute the
   optimal actions. Tests are performed on three and five substation power
   systems to recover from attacks that compromise relays to cause
   transmission line overflow. The paper also analyses the impact of reward
   and state transition model on computation. Corresponding results verify
   the efficacy of the proposed engine.},

   related problems: A short review and perspectives},
Journal = {ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {48},
Pages = {22-35},
Abstract = {This paper reviews existing works on (deep) reinforcement learning
   considerations in electric power system control. The works are reviewed
   as they relate to electric power system operating states (normal,
   preventive, emergency, restorative) and control levels (local,
   household, microgrid, subsystem, wide-area). Due attention is paid to
   the control-related problems considerations (cyber-security, big data
   analysis, short-term load forecast, and composite load modelling).
   Observations from reviewed literature are drawn and perspectives
   discussed. In order to make the text compact and as easy as possible to
   read, the focus is only on the works published (or ``in press{''}) in
   journals and books while conference publications are not included.
   Exceptions are several work available in open repositories likely to
   become journal publications in near future. Hopefully this paper could
   serve as a good source of information for all those interested in
   solving similar problems. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a special type of cryptosystem,
   which provide encryption and decryption functions based on users
   attributes. Due to the functionality and flexibility of ABE, it is
   considered to be suitable for providing data security and privacy
   preserving security in the cloud storage environment. However, lack of
   user revocation mechanism is considered to be a disadvantage of
   traditional ABE. In this paper, we study the direct revocation mechanism
   of ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE), construct a new directly revocable
   CP-ABE in the composite order group, and prove it to achieve adaptive
   security using dual system encryption in the standard model. On this
   basis, we introduce user revocation centre (URC) in this system, and
   outsource the revocation tasks to URC. Users need not to master the
   latest revocation list for encrypting, and need not to pay any
   additional computing for revocation. In addition, when revocation list
   changes, URC can update the ciphertexts for users. Finally, we introduce
   how to deploy our schemes in cloud storage environment.},

Abstract = {Aiming at the accuracy and security of pattern recognition system, this
   paper proposes a quaternion based multi-modal recognition algorithm that
   is more accurate and safe than unimodal, and fuses more features than
   most existing methods. Our algorithm fuses four features that involve
   two linear features and two non-linear features of two kinds of
   modalities. We fuse features into quaternion and the process of
   recognition is dealt in quaternion field. The equal error rate (EER) and
   DET curves given by the experiment we did on Yale face database and
   PolyU palm print database show that the quaternion based algorithm we
   proposed improves the recognition rate observably.},

Abstract = {Traditional passive defense methods cannot resist the constantly updated
   and evolving cyber attacks. The concept of resilience is introducing to
   measure the ability of the system to maintain its function under attack.
   It matters in evaluating the security of modern industrial systems. This
   paper presents a 3D Resilience State Space method to assess
   Communication-based train control (CBTC) system resilience under malware
   attack. We model the spread of malware as two functions: the
   communicability function f(x) and the susceptibility function g(x). We
   describe the characteristics of these two function in the CBTC complex
   network by using the percolation theory. Then we use a perturbation
   formalism to analyze the impact of malware attack on information flow
   and use it as an indicator of the cyber layer state. The CBTC
   cyber-physical system resilience metric formalizes as the system state
   transitions in three-dimensional state space. The three dimensions
   respectively represent the cyber layer state, the physical layer state,
   and the transmission layer state. The simulation results reveal that the
   proposed framework can effectively assess the resilience of the CBTC
   system. And the anti-malware programs can prevent the spread of malware
   and improve CBTC system resilience.},

Abstract = {In typical radar systems, the process of recognizing a target requires
   human involvement. This human element makes radar systems not fully
   reliable due to unstable performance that varies between operators. This
   paper describes an intelligent radar system which addresses this problem
   in a border surveillance environment. The proposed radar system is
   capable of automatically detecting and then classifying different
   targets using an artificial neural network trained with the
   Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The training and test sets presented to
   the neural network are composed by high-resolution Inverse Synthetic
   Aperture Radar pictures obtained by the radar's detection module.
   Simulation results show that the intelligent radar system can reliably
   detect and distinguish the different objectives. Moreover, the radar
   system can outperform human operators and another radar system that
   deals with similar objectives. These results indicate that future
   intelligent systems can potentially replace human radar operators in
   this critical security setting.},

Abstract = {An ear biometric system that extends the ideas from elastic graph
   matching and principal component analysis (PCA) is introduced. For ear
   representation, an ``ear graph{''} whose vertices are labeled by the
   Gabor jets of body of the antihelix, superior antihelix crus, and
   inferior antihelix crus is introduced. A new ear detection algorithm is
   developed, introducing the notion of ``jet space similarity,{''} which
   denotes the similarity between Gabor jets and reconstructed jets
   obtained by PCA. Using the Extended Multi Modal Verification for
   Teleservices and Security applications (XM2VTS) database, the
   performance of the introduced system is found to be comparable to that
   of existing systems, and the detection performance is found to be higher
   compared with existing object detection algorithms using the distance
   from face space and average jets.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a system concept for persistent (up to 365 days,
   24/7), unmanned, local-area surveillance of maritime surface and
   sub-surface objects, as well as air objects, in the Canadian Arctic. The
   system concept is based on unmanned, remotely controlled and monitored
   Local-Area Arctic Surveillance Systems (LAASS) that could be deployed at
   one or more maritime chokepoints, at locations in the Canadian Arctic
   Archipelago. The LAASS would be operated over a satellite communications
   channel from a Southern Control Centre (SCC) located in the south of
   Canada. Surveillance information for each detected platform and
   environmental reports for the local operating area would be compiled
   semi-automatically, from the integration of data transmitted from
   multiple above-water and underwater sensors and self-reporting systems,
   and be disseminated, in near real-time, to defence, security, and public
   safety clients. The system concept is comprised of a surveillance
   concept which includes environmental and geographic factors, platform
   types under potential surveillance, end-user information requirements,
   contributions of individual sensor types to surveillance, and the role
   of local-area surveillance within the broader context of Arctic Domain
   Awareness and a system operating concept. The system operating concept
   describes the system capabilities and operating modes required to
   achieve the surveillance concept. Consideration is given to the
   interplay between the automation level, the quality and timeliness of
   the resulting information productions, the allocation of processing
   functions between the SCC and the LAASS, and transmitted data volumes.},

Abstract = {Cisco's VPN and Security Management System (VMS) is based on a
   hierarchical security policy model. Customers have found this
   hierarchical composition policy model a clear and succinct form for
   expressing policy enforced by multiple security devices. However, many
   customers also need to make changes to their Cisco devices directly via
   command line interface (CLI) to trouble shoot or deal with an immediate
   problem and then reintegrate the semantic changes back into the VMS
   policy. This paper outlines techniques for reincorporating such out of
   band, low level configuration changes back into the common hierarchical

Abstract = {Today internet based e-commerce has become a trend and business
   necessity. Security of online e-commerce over the Internet is provided
   through Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS). The
   SSL/TLS uses public key cryptographic algorithms which are computational
   intensive due to the modular multiplications. Therefore, SSL/TLS servers
   often become overloaded while performing public key decryptions when the
   simultaneous requests increase rapidly. Overload can lead e-commerce
   applications to considerable revenue losses, response times may grow to
   unacceptable levels and as a result the server may saturate even crash.
   So load management of SSL/TLS web server is a critical issue in
   e-commerce. The proposed work in this paper is to manage load on the
   server by applying Adaptive SSL policy and session handling mechanism.
   This policy is self-adaptive security, which offers great potential in
   providing timely and fine grained security control on server, by runtime
   adaptation of cryptographic algorithm. The implementation results in
   more efficient system with better throughput and response time.},

   variation regularity of each node is a key for optimal dispatch,

   former researches. It proposes a hierarchy and subarea idea to construct
   a framework of self-adapting dynamic model. With the top layer load
   forecasting implemented by Recursive Least Square Support Vector
   Machines (RLS-SVM) algorithm, discrete state-space equations are
   established to describe dynamic characteristics of multi-node load
   parameters (active load distribution factors and power factors), and
   then TS fuzzy control technique is introduced to realize feedback
   compensation. The application in an actual power system control center
   of Shandong province has been verified with satisfactory result.},

Title = {Identity Management in Future Railway Mobile Communication System},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The Future Railway Mobile Communication System (FRMCS) has emerged as a
   worldwide standard for railway communication. This technology enables
   the operational efficiency and safety of railways to be improved by
   providing mission critical communications, machine-type communication
   for the railway system on board, in addition to trackside telemetry and
   broadband connectivity for passengers. Different equipment types, users,
   and functional identities can be involved in communication, and each of
   them is uniquely identified. Identity management is an important part of
   the security functions provided by the FRMCS system. This paper presents
   a service-oriented approach to identity management functionality,
   enabling service composition for railway applications and service
   virtualization. This paper studies functionality for the initial
   registration and subsequent deregistration of railway devices, users,
   and their functional identities, in addition to the transfer of the
   registered identities between different FRMCS serving areas while the
   train moves. Two FRMCS services that follow the principles of
   representational state transfer architecture are proposed. Services'
   functionality is illustrated by use cases, data types, and application
   programming interfaces that enable services to be interacted with.
   Identity registration status models are developed, formally described,
   and mathematically verified. Discussion of the applicability of the
   proposed services for the implementation of FRMCS security and safety
   functions is provided. The presented service-oriented approach features
   a satisfactory level of flexibility and versatility.},

   Small Buffer Sizes},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {128684-128693},
Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel max-weight secure link selection
   (MWSLS) scheme to enhance physical layer security of decode-and-forward
   (DF) buffer-aided relay networks. The MWSLS scheme can select the link
   with the largest weight among all secure and available source-to-relay
   and relay-to-destination links. By modeling the dynamic buffer state
   transitions as a Markov chain, we derive the closed-form expressions of
   the secrecy outage probability, the secrecy diversity gain, the average
   secrecy throughput and the end to end delay, which provide a
   comprehensive and effective way to evaluate the impacts of different
   parameters on the secrecy performance. The results of this paper reveal
   that: 1) For the case with small buffer sizes, a significant enhancement
   on the secrecy outage performance can be observed compared with the
   popular max-link secure link selection (MLSLS) scheme. 2) When L >= 3,
   the secrecy diversity gain of the system can achieve 2M, while the MLSLS
   scheme achieves the same secrecy diversity gain only when L -> infinity
   (where M denotes the number of relays and L is the buffer size). 3) The
   MWSLS scheme outperforms the MLSLS scheme in terms of the average
   secrecy throughput and the end to end delay in the low signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) regime, and obtain the same performance as the latter in the
   high SNR regime.},

Abstract = {Quantum teleportation provides a way to transmit information from one
   location to another via a quantum channel. In traditional teleportation
   schemes, if the quantum channel is a non-maximally entangled quantum
   state, the success probability of teleporting an unknown
   three-dimensional quantum state can not be reached 100\%. Here we
   propose a deterministic teleportation scheme to overcome this challenge,
   and our results show that the success probability of teleporting a
   three-dimensional quantum state can be increased to 100\%. In
   particular, we have analyzed the security of our teleportation process,
   including particle transmission, and proved this process safe. Our
   scheme has high experimental feasibility.},

   Systems Applied to Distributed Water-Energy-Food Nexus},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 23},
Abstract = {The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus significantly and effectively address
   sustainability issues internationally. However, there has been little
   attention paid to the WEF Nexus challenges related to sustainable
   livelihoods, such as resource access, resource security, and resource
   utilization. Given the need to establish design research, policy
   formulation, and resource management based on end-user needs, new
   research hypotheses and available models must be proposed on a
   small-scale scale of households and communities. This paper combines the
   Sustainable Product-Service System (SPSS) and Distributed Economies
   (DE), two prospective and intertwined models combining environmental,
   social, and economic sustainability with the WEF Nexus approach, to
   emphasize the shift to small-scale and highly localized WEF systems and
   the product and service system based on the satisfaction unit, i.e.,
   designing SPSS applied to Distributed WEF Nexus. This paradigm shift is
   presented and detailed in an 11-dimensional canvas with an analytical,
   conceptual research approach to help to define and analyze the
   characteristics of existing solutions and promote innovative ideas or
   scenarios in a sustainable WEF nexus. The new 11-dimensional canvas
   tool, in particular, is thought to have the potential to become a basic
   research analysis and innovative strategic tool in this field after
   being tested and evaluated by forty companies, experts, and designers in
   China and Italy. Finally, despite considerable implementation obstacles,
   this innovative application of multi-mode integration still has the
   potential for win-win sustainability, to meet human needs for clean
   water, safe energy, and sufficient food, ultimately accelerating the
   transition to a sustainable society.},

Abstract = {Reasoning about authorization policies has been a prominent issue in
   information security research. In a complex information sharing and
   exchange environment, a user's request may initiate a sequence of
   executions of authorization commands in order to decide whether such
   request should be granted or denied. Becker and Nanz's logic of
   State-Modifying Policies (SMP) is a formal system addressing such
   problem in access control. In this paper, we provide a declarative
   semantics for SMP through a translation from SMP to Answer Set
   Programming (ASP). We show that our translation is sound and complete
   for bounded SMP reasoning. With this translation, we are able not only
   to directly compute users' authorization query answers, but also to
   specifically extract information of how users' authorization states
   change in relation to the underlying query answering. In this way, we
   eventually avoid SMP's tedious proof system and significantly simply the
   SMP reasoning process. Furthermore, we argue that the proposed ASP
   translation of SMP also provides a flexibility to enhance SMP's capacity
   for accommodating more complex authorization reasoning problems that the
   current SMP lacks.},

Abstract = {A new type of non-metallic ultrasonic transducer driving system is
   designed in this paper.Based on the analysis of the traditional
   ultrasonic transmitting circuit, a new type of ultrasonic transmitting
   circuit is designed by using the principle of inductance energy storage
   to generate high power pulse.The design uses the FET as the switching
   control component.Compared with the traditional capacitive ultrasonic
   transmitting system, the whole circuit design has the advantages of high
   security and no need to provide DC high voltage power supply. It also
   has the advantages of small size and easy adjustment of driving waveform
   parameters.The system outputs a trigger pulse signal through the
   two-core system to control the operating state of the entire circuit.By
   establishing the circuit model of the ultrasonic transmitting circuit
   and making the actual circuit, it is proved that the circuit can
   generate the ultrasonic pulse excitation signal with adjustable
   frequency and amplitude.Finally, experimental verification is carried
   out, the effect is good, and the hidden danger of safety is eliminated.},

Abstract = {Utilizing biometric traits for privacy-and securityapplications is
   receiving an increasing attention. Applications such as personal
   identification, access control, forensics applications, e-banking,
   e-government, e-health and recently personalized human-smart-home and
   human-robot interaction present some examples. In order to offer
   person-specific services for/of specific person a pre-identifying step
   should be done in the run-up. Using biometric in such application is
   encountered by diverse challenges. First, using one trait and excluding
   the others depends on the application aimed to. Some applications demand
   directly touch to biometric sensors, while others don't. Second
   challenge is the reliability of used biometric arrangement. Civilized
   application demands lower reliability comparing to the forensics ones.
   And third, for biometric system could only one trait be used (uni-modal
   systems) or multiple traits (Bi-or Multi-modal systems). The latter is
   applied, when systems with a relative high reliability are expected. The
   main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive view about biometric
   and its application. The above mentioned challenges will be analyzed
   deeply. The suitability of each biometric sensor according to the aimed
   application will be deeply discussed. Detailed comparison between
   uni-modal and Multi-modal biometric system will present which system
   where to be utilized. Privacy and security issues of biometric systems
   will be discussed too. Three scenarios of biometric application in
   home-environment, humanrobot- interaction and e-health will be
   presented.},

Title = {CAD: Command-Level Anomaly Detection for Vehicle-Road Collaborative
   Charging Network},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {34910-34924},
Abstract = {A large number of charging piles installed on roadside parking spaces
   and smart poles on the roadside of the Internet have become essential
   substation infrastructure (roadside) for building a vehicle-road
   coordinated charging network for electric vehicles. The management
   system of China National Grid's network-load interaction includes the
   interaction between these main stations (traffic control stations) and
   substations (roadsides). The Internet-friendly interactive communication
   protocol for China's vehicle-road coordination is IEC 60870-5-104 (104
   protocol). The control network of the vehicle-road collaborative
   charging network has many characteristics, such as multiple levels,
   multiple types, and frequent information exchange for monitoring and
   control. Various types of operational information and control commands
   are subject to eavesdropping, tampering, and interruption during
   collection, transmission, and triggering. This paper proposes a
   command-level anomaly detection (CAD) method for a vehicle-road
   collaborative charging network. The CAD method analyzes the protocol for
   the specification format and business command characteristics of the 104
   protocol. This paper uses the dynamic analysis protocol fuzzy test to
   realize the dynamic information in the program to guide the generation
   of test cases and pass the Markov state transition diagram. We describe
   the state transition and abnormality identification of protocol
   messages. We also design a long-term memory network to implement
   instruction-level anomaly feature mining. The experiment proved the
   validity of CAD. If we adopt other new protocols for the vehicle-road
   coordinated network in different countries or regions, the analysis of
   the new protocol can be completed in the same way, which has strong
   application value and prospect.},

Abstract = {In a power grid with significant components of distributed generation
   and insufficient spinning reserve, the quality of delivered power may
   not meet the requirements of advanced manufacturing. A system design for
   power quality security which uses solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)
   technology is described. Critical parameters for system performance are
   continuous supply voltage at the nominal voltage and frequency. The grid
   chosen for this study has significant voltage fluctuations and periodic
   voltage drops and surges, including total power loss. A supply of
   methane from a sewer sludge digester is scrubbed Of CO2 and used for
   continuous standby operation, with excess stored to enable 8 h operation
   of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). The system employs a modular,
   thermally coupled, SOFC architecture that includes steam reforming of
   the methane fuel, a rectifier, power controls, and control system.
   Continuous operation of a 125 kW tubular SOFC stack maintains operating
   temperature and steam for fuel reforming in a secondary SOFC stack, by
   exhausting through it before a gas turbine expands the exhaust to supply
   the plant air and fuel compression. Modelling of the energy balance of
   the system demonstrates the standby and full power operating modes. The
   system is sized at 250 kW to supply secure power for a manufacturing
   facility. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Focusing on the problems of platform monopoly, power rent-seeking and
   high cost in the current Internet e-commerce platform system, a new
   method and paradigm of e-commerce platform is introduced in this paper
   based on the blockchain, smart contract technology, tokenomics thought,
   and e-commerce professional theory. The interconnection of e-commerce
   information value chain can be realized by means of blockchain related
   technology and the construction of circulation system, payment system,
   and credit system in the core module of e-commerce platform. From the
   perspective of users of e-commerce platform, the optimizing of the
   application process and operation structure of e-commerce operation can
   significantly improve users' service experience, avoid information
   disclosure risk, and reduce process redundancy as well. The prominent

   distortions of VoIP transmission influence the speaker verification
   scores. As a reference database XM2VTS (Extended multi Modal
   Verification for Teleservices and Security appliations Data Base)
   containing English speech (strings of digits) was applied. Three coder
   degradations (PCM, G.711A and G.723.1) and three network conditions were
   examined in various configurations to estimate the influence of each,
   coding and transmission degradation for the final verification scores.},

Title = {An Enhanced Multi-Stage Semantic Attack Against Industrial Control
   Systems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {156871-156882},
Abstract = {Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play a very important role in national
   critical infrastructures. However, the growing interaction between the
   modern ICS and the Internet has made ICS more vulnerable to cyber
   attacks. In order to protect ICS from malicious attacks, intrusion
   detection technology emerges. By analyzing the network meta data or the
   industrial process data, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can identify
   attacks that violate communication protocols or system specifications.
   However, the existing intrusion detection technology is not omnipotent,
   which opens up a back door for some more advanced attacks. In this work,
   we design an enhanced multi-stage semantic attack against ICS, which is
   undetectable by existing IDS. By hijacking the communication channels
   between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the remote Programmable
   Logic Controllers (PLCs), the attacker can manipulate the measurement
   data and control instructions simultaneously. The fake measurement data
   deceives the human operator into making wrong decisions. Furthermore,
   the attacker can strategically manipulate the semantic meaning of
   control instructions according to system state transition rules. In the
   meanwhile, a fake view of measurement data is presented to the HMI to
   conceal the on-going malicious attack. This attack is totally stealthy
   since the message sizes and timing, the command sequences, and the
   system state values are all legitimate. Consequently, this attack can
   secretly bring the system into critical states. Experimental results
   have verified the strong attack ability of the proposed attack.},

Title = {Android-GAN: Defending against android pattern attacks using multi-modal
   generative network as anomaly detector},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {141},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Android pattern lock system is a popular form of user authentication
   extensively used in mobile phones today. However, it is vulnerable to
   potential security attacks such as shoulder surfing, camera attack and
   smudge attack. This study proposes a new kind of authentication system
   based on a generative deep neural network that can defend any attacks by
   imposters except a registered user. This network adopts the anomaly
   detection paradigm where only normal data is used while training the
   network. For this purpose, we utilize both Generative Adversarial
   Networks as an anomaly detector and Long Short Term Memory that
   processes ID time varying signals converted from 2D Android patterns. To
   handle the stability problem of GANs during the training, Replay Buffer,
   which has been effectively used in Deep Q-Networks, is also utilized.
   Evaluation of the proposed method was carried out thoroughly and the
   accuracy reached to 0.95 in term of the Area Under Curve. Although
   training this network requires extensive computing resources, it runs on
   a mobile phone well since the testing version is very light. Further
   experiments conducted using a group of mobile phone users, including
   posture variation study, provided comparable performance as well.
   Results suggest that the proposed system has a potential for real world
   application. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In contrast to the increasing popularity of RE-presentational State
   Transfer (REST), systematic testing of RESTful Application Programming
   Interfaces (API) has not attracted much attention so far. This paper
   describes different aspects of automated testing of RESTful APIs. Later,
   we focus on functional and security tests, for which we apply a
   technique called model-based software development. Based on an abstract
   model of the RESTful API that comprises resources, states and
   transitions a software generator not only creates the source code of the
   RESTful API but also creates a large number of test cases that can be
   immediately used to test the implementation. This paper describes the
   process of developing a software generator for test cases using
   state-of-the-art tools and provides an example to show the feasibility
   of our approach.},

Abstract = {Future industrial networks are expected to not only provide a rich
   environment of very different devices, but also will host a multitude of
   applications operated and managed by different parties, the so-called
   tenants. Isolation of tenants is essential for a stable and secure
   operation of a factory. Application upgrades and novel software enable
   faster innovation cycles. Secure remote management allows more
   outsourcing to third parties but leads to continuously changing factory
   networks. Mobile or even autonomous devices again add complexity.
   However, current factory owners are conservative for good reasons:
   changing a well-designed system is costly and may cause failures and
   outages of the production lines. The virtual tenant network (VTN)
   concept addresses this conflict by means of combining network
   virtualization, hardware virtualization, cloud technologies and IT
   automation. Thus, tenants are isolated and configuration changes or
   security breaches in one tenant will not affect others. The concept at
   hand borrows from data center technology but adopts those ideas to the
   embedded world of industrial networks.},

   Our proposed design adopts a hybrid Liquid State Machine (LSM) approach
   to perform automatic features extraction and multi-modal fusion scheme
   for users' interaction. Our work establishes the design concepts for
   future on-chip and explains why LSM can be a promising approach for
   fast, adaptive and reliable hardware CASs. The experimental part reveals

Abstract = {The security defense problem shows a great significance in industrial
   networks for the existence of security risks. However traditional
   defense methods reveal technical limitations. To address this issue, a
   dynamic defense method with the characteristic of endogenous security is
   proposed in this paper. The main idea is to establish a multi-mode,
   dynamic and transparent security-specific channel between controlled
   devices, by utilizing the reconstruction of IP packet and the random
   change of security elements such as encryption algorithms, keys and
   authentication passwords, so as to form an endogenously secure
   industrial control network system. This method is further implemented by
   FPGA hardware, such that the performances of real-time and security of
   the control network are both guaranteed. Experimental results show that
   the proposed method can effectively prevent typical security risks such
   as unauthorized accesses, middle-man attacks and replay attacks from the
   network, changing the passive defense as the active defense and changing
   the boundary security into endogenous security.},

Abstract = {Treating voltage controllers as autonomous control agents, a novel
   secondary voltage regulation (SVR) strategy based on multi-agent theory
   is presented for improving the performance of secondary voltage control
   actions under different system operating states. According to the
   principle of the multi-agent technology, the framework of this new type
   of control scheme is described and the optimal coordination methods are
   investigated in the paper. Under normal conditions, secondary voltage
   controller (treated as Coordination Agent) is responsible for
   coordinating primary voltage controller (treated as Execution Agent)
   based on the optimization of the quadratic programming objective. In
   system contingencies, the agent-based cooperation methods are presented
   for enhancing the ability of fast and coordinated voltage and reactive
   power control. The concept of virtual control agency is proposed to
   adapt the emergency dynamic control environment. Contract net protocol
   (CNP), a widely used protocol in multi-agent system, is introduced to
   realize optimal coordination and cooperation among control agents in the
   agency. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is very
   effective for maintaining an appropriate voltage profile under normal
   operating conditions and settling voltage violation problems in system
   contingencies, which is helpful in keeping voltage stability in case of
   large disturbances. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Modern Power Systems often operate close to their stability limits in
   order to meet the continuously growing demand, due to the difficulties
   in expanding the generation and transmission system. An effective way to
   face power system contingencies that can lead to instability is load
   shedding. In this paper we propose a method to assess the dynamic
   performance of the Greek mainland Power System and to propose a load
   shedding scheme in order to maintain voltage stability under various
   loading conditions and operating states in the presence of critical
   contingencies including outages of one or more generating units in the
   south part of the system. A Decision Tree is used to assess the dynamic
   Performance of the system. The candidate attributes of the Decision Tree
   are chosen through a data mining process.},

Abstract = {Intel software guard extensions (SGX) technology allows cloud vendors to
   provide customers with an independent and trusted execution environment
   (TEE). It protects critical data confidentiality and integrity from
   malicious software. However, more and more SGX side-channel attacks have
   appeared, which seriously undermine the confidence of tenants in cloud
   security. The related research focuses on system hardware and SGX
   compiler solutions for specific attacks, which also has difficulties in
   deployment. Differently, we propose an intelligent-driven proactive
   defense strategy, which is based on live migration. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first proactive defense against SGX side-channel
   attacks. We adopt the Markov decision process to solve the migration
   programming problem. The innovative deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
   solves problems of the unknown state transition probability and large
   machine load states, which is called self-checking proximal policy
   optimization (SPPO). It changes the reward pattern, improving the
   convergence speed and stability of DRL. In prototype experiments, we
   deploy the strategy in the OpenStack platform agilely to prove the
   defense performance and low virtual machine costs.},

Title = {A Novel Fusion System Based on Iris and Ear Biometrics for E-exams},

Abstract = {With the rapid spread of the coronavirus epidemic all over the world,
   educational and other institutions are heading towards digitization. In
   the era of digitization, identifying educational e-platform users using
   ear and iris based multi -modal biometric systems constitutes an urgent
   and interesting research topic to pre-serve enterprise security,
   particularly with wearing a face mask as a precaution against the new
   coronavirus epidemic. This study proposes a multimodal system based on
   ear and iris biometrics at the feature fusion level to identify students
   in electronic examinations (E-exams) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   proposed system comprises four steps. The first step is image
   preprocessing, which includes enhancing, segmenting, and extracting the
   regions of interest. The second step is feature extraction, where the
   Haralick texture and shape methods are used to extract the features of
   ear images, whereas Tamura texture and color histogram methods are used
   to extract the features of iris images. The third step is feature
   fusion, where the extracted features of the ear and iris images are
   combined into one sequential fused vector. The fourth step is the
   matching, which is executed using the City Block Dis-tance (CTB) for
   student identification. The findings of the study indicate that the
   system's recognition accuracy is 97\%, with a 2\% False Acceptance Rate
   (FAR), a 4\% False Rejection Rate (FRR), a 94\% Correct Recognition Rate
   (CRR), and a 96\% Genuine Acceptance Rate (GAR). In addition, the
   proposed recognition sys-tem achieved higher accuracy than other related
   systems.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of ultra-high-voltage (UHV) AC/DC, especially
   the step-by-step upgrading of the UHV DC transmission scale, security
   presents new challenges. Commutation failure (CF) is a common fault in
   line commutated converter (LCC) high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power
   systems. Once failure happens, it may cause power oscillations in a
   system. In this paper, taking a two-area AC/DC parallel interconnected
   power system as the example, based on the impulse response model of
   second-order linear system, the mechanism of power oscillation on the AC
   tie-line caused by CF are clarified. It is proved that the peak value of
   the AC tie-line power oscillation is mainly determined by the DC power
   and the equivalent CF duration, the frequency and damping ratio of
   dominant area oscillation mode. Meanwhile, the peak time is mainly
   determined by the oscillation frequency. Finally, the correctness and
   effectiveness of the algorithms are verified by a simulation analysis of
   an extended IEEE-39-bus AC/DC parallel interconnected power system.
   These research results can provide a basis for the arrangement of the
   operating modes and the formulation of control measures for
   interconnected power grids.},

Abstract = {In those broadcast application scenarios with a great quantity of
   receivers, e.g., the data access control system in cloud storage
   service, the single sender is apt to become the efficiency bottleneck of
   the system, because the computation and storage overhead of the sender
   will grow rapidly with the amount of qualified receivers. In order to
   overcome this problem, we first introduce the novel conception of
   complete binary identity tree which is adopted to manage the qualified
   receivers. Then we design the prune-merge algorithm to further optimize
   the structure of the tree and cut down the amount of receivers. The
   algorithm effectively reduces the computation and storage cost of the
   trusted authority in the system. Subsequently, in virtue of
   composite-order bilinear groups, we bring forward an efficient public
   key broadcast encryption scheme combined its application to the system
   of data access control in cloud storage service. Compared with the
   existing schemes, the lengths of system public parameters, secret key
   and ciphertext in our scheme are all constant. In addition, the number
   of secret keys in our scheme increases logarithmically with the maximum
   amount of receivers, while the numbers of secret keys in the existing
   schemes increase linearly with the maximum amount of receivers.
   Furthermore, the proposed scheme is proved to guarantee adaptive
   security under general subgroup decision assumption in the standard
   model. The performance analysis manifests that our scheme is feasible
   for those broadcast applications with fixed senders.},

Abstract = {Distribution Feeder Reconfiguration (DFR) is an important technique to
   improve the performance of distribution networks. The common objectives
   considered in the DFR problem are power loss and voltage deviation which
   are important objectives for traditional distribution systems. Security
   issues cause by Distributed Generations (DGs) in modern distribution
   systems which can potentially jeopardize power system security has
   almost neglected in power system operation problem. Toward this end,
   this study considers the power loss, Voltage Stability Index (VSI), and
   number of switching as objective functions which can satisfy both
   operation and security expectations. The Backward-Forward Sweep (BFS)
   method known for easy convergence has been employed for power flow
   calculations. Because of the increase in DG penetration in distributed
   systems, the impacts of these units are investigated. A powerful
   optimization algorithm based on hybridization of Shuffled Frog Leaping
   Algorithm (SFLA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed to
   solve the proposed problem. The proposed algorithm is a combination of
   strong mutation operator, original SFLA and original PSO algorithms
   which has high population diversity and search ability. The proposed

Abstract = {Game theory applies to scenarios wherein multiple players with contrary
   motives contend with each other. Various solutions based on Game theory
   have been recently proposed which dealt with security aspects of
   wireless sensor networks(WSNs). However, the nodes have limited
   capability of rationality and evolutionary learning which makes it
   unfavorable to apply conventional game theory in WSNs. Evolutionary Game
   Theory(EGT) relies on bounded rationality assumption which is in harmony
   with the wireless sensor networks characteristics. Based on EGT, authors
   propose an adaptive security model for WSNs for the selection of
   cryptographic protocols during runtime. The authors formulate this
   selection in WSNs with the help of an evolutionary game to obtain the
   evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the system. In this model, the
   sensor nodes dynamically adapt their defensive strategies to attain the
   most efficient defense, corresponding to the attackers' varied
   strategies. Further, the simulations convey that the proposed system
   converges rapidly to the Evolutionary Stable Strategy. Not only the
   system converges, but also forms a stable system which was verified by
   deliberately destabilizing the system. Results show that the nodes
   quickly return to ESS even after perturbation. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {The open-ended nature of the Internet of Things (IoT) had whipped them
   vulnerable to a variety of attacks, therefore the need of securing and
   stabilizing the network while keeping the integrity intact has become
   the most prominent requirement. Traditionally cryptographic methods were
   employed to secure networks but the demand of undesirable code size and
   processing time had given rise to trust-based schemes for addressing the
   misbehavior of attacks in the IoT networks. With reference to it,
   several trust-based schemes have been proposed by researchers. However,
   the prevailing schemes require high computational power and memory
   space; which weakens the network integrity and control. In this context,
   the paper presents a Light-weight Hidden Markov Model (L/W- HMT) for
   trust evaluation to alleviate the effect of compromised nodes and
   restricts the storage of unnecessary data to reduce overhead, memory,
   and energy consumption. This research work has presented a 2state HMM
   with Trusted state and compromised state together with essential and
   unessential output as observation state. Amount of packets forwarded,
   dropped, modified, and received are the parameters for state transition
   and emission matrices while the forward likelihood function evaluates
   the trust value of the node. Simulation performed on MATLAB indicates
   that the intended L/W-HMT scheme outperforms in connection with
   detection rate, packet delivery rate and energy consumption, on an
   average by 6\%, 8\% and 70\% respectively when compared to the similar
   OADM trust model.},

Abstract = {As healthcare in many countries faces an aging population and rising
   costs, mobile sensing technologies promise a new opportunity. Using
   mobile health (mHealth) sensing, which uses medical sensors to collect
   data about the patients, and mobile phones to act as a gateway between
   sensors and electronic health record systems, caregivers can
   continuously monitor the patients and deliver better care. Furthermore,
   individuals can become better engaged in monitoring and managing their
   own health. Although some work on mHealth sensing has addressed
   security, achieving strong privacy for low-power sensors remains a
   challenge. We make three contributions. First, we propose an mHealth
   sensing protocol that provides strong security and privacy properties at
   the link layer, with low energy overhead, suitable for low-power
   sensors. The protocol uses three novel techniques: adaptive security, to
   dynamically modify transmission overhead; MAC striping, to make forgery
   difficult even for small-sized Message Authentication Codes; and
   asymmetric resource requirements, in recognition of the limited
   resources in tiny mHealth sensors. Second, we demonstrate its
   feasibility by implementing a prototype on a Chronos wrist device, and
   evaluating it experimentally. Third, we provide a security, privacy, and
   energy analysis of our system.},

Title = {Adaptively secure CP-ABE for circuits with fan-in n and fan-out 1},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 23},
Abstract = {The attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme is suitable for access
   control of ciphertext in cloud computing. Kowalczyk and Wee proposed an
   adaptively secure attribute-based encryption scheme that supports NC1
   circuits. However, the cipher text length increases rapidly with the
   depth of the circuit, resulting in an increase of the computational
   complexity of the encryption and decryption algorithms. In this paper,
   to overcome this challenge, a ciphertext-policy ABE scheme that supports
   circuits with fan-in n is proposed. First, we design new pebble rules
   for secret sharing in circuits with fan-in n, improving the compactness
   of the security reduction. Then, the new secret sharing scheme is
   embedded in the encryption algorithm, which is the key to improving
   efficiency. Moreover, we prove the adaptive security of the scheme by
   using a piecewise guessing framework and dual-system encryption.
   Finally, by comparison analysis, this scheme exhibits a better
   performance.},

   and Deep Reinforcement Learning},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {DEC 16},
Abstract = {Aiming at the existing network attack and defense stochastic game
   models, most of them are based on the assumption of complete
   information, which causes the problem of poor applicability of the
   model. Based on the actual modeling requirements of the network attack
   and defense process, a network defense decision-making model combining
   incomplete information stochastic game and deep reinforcement learning
   is proposed. This model regards the incomplete information of the
   attacker and the defender as the defender's uncertainty about the
   attacker's type and uses the Double Deep Q-Network algorithm to solve
   the problem of the difficulty of determining the network state
   transition probability, so that the network system can dynamically
   adjust the defense strategy. Finally, a simulation experiment was
   performed on the proposed model. The results show that, under the same
   experimental conditions, the proposed method in this paper has a better
   convergence speed than other methods in solving the defense equilibrium
   strategy. This model is a fusion of traditional methods and artificial
   intelligence technology and provides new research ideas for the
   application of artificial intelligence in the field of cyberspace
   security.},

Title = {An Approach Enabling Various Queries on Encrypted Industrial Data Stream},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2019},

Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Massive data are generated and collected by devices in the industrial
   Internet of Things. Data sources would encrypt the data and send them to
   the data center through the gateway. For some supervision purpose, the
   gateway needs to observe the encrypted data stream and label the
   suspicious data. Instead of decrypting ciphertext at the gateway, which
   is not efficient, this paper presents a Phi-searchable functional
   encryption scheme that supports inner product evaluations on encrypted
   data. Based on this scheme, an approach enabling various queries on the
   encrypted industrial data stream is proposed. The adaptive security of
   our proposed underlying functional encryption scheme can be proven under
   general subgroup decision assumptions, and our scheme has the smaller
   public key, the smaller secret key, and the smaller ciphertext size
   compared to the related schemes. In addition, the experimental results
   show that our proposed scheme is efficient. Especially for the gateway,
   querying on the encrypted data only needs less than 20ms, which is
   practical for industrial data stream auditing scenario.},

Abstract = {The goal of the research reported here was to investigate whether the
   design methodology utilising embodied agents can be applied to produce a
   multi-modal human-computer interface for cyberspace events visualisation
   control. This methodology requires that the designed system structure be
   defined in terms of cooperating agents having well-defined internal
   components exhibiting specified behaviours. System activities are
   defined in terms of finite state machines and behaviours parameterised
   by transition functions. In the investigated case the multi-modal
   interface is a component of the Operational Centre which is a part of
   the National Cybersecurity Platform. Embodied agents have been
   successfully used in the design of robotic systems. However robots
   operate in physical environments, while cyberspace events visualisation
   involves cyberspace, thus the applied design methodology required a
   different definition of the environment. It had to encompass the
   physical environment in which the operator acts and the computer screen
   where the results of those actions are presented. Smart human-computer
   interaction (HCI) is a time-aware, dynamic process in which two parties
   communicate via different modalities, e.g., voice, gesture, eye
   movement. The use of computer vision and machine intelligence techniques
   are essential when the human is carrying an exhausting and concentration
   demanding activity. The main role of this interface is to support
   security analysts and operators controlling visualisation of cyberspace
   events like incidents or cyber attacks especially when manipulating
   graphical information. Visualisation control modalities include visual
   gesture- and voice-based commands.},

Abstract = {Connected medicine, using smart (software based and networked) medical
   devices is frequently presented as the major disruptive trend in health
   care. Such devices will however be broadly used only if they are
   ``prescribed{''} by the hospitals as a part of a therapy and are
   reimbursed by the insurances. For this we need the proof of their
   safety, medical efficacy and economic efficiency. Aside of obligatory
   clinical trials we need an extensive system of post-market surveillance,
   because: a medical device is a part of a complex cyber-physical system,
   with humans in the loop/the environment cannot be sufficiently
   defined/humans react differently to the therapy, they also behave
   differently / after every software upgrade the device is not the same as
   before In their operation such devices generate huge amounts of data
   that can be reused for such analysis. Technically oriented people
   believe it can be done using a Big Data Analytics system without a
   deeper understanding of the underlying processes. It is doubtful if such
   approach can deliver useful results. The main problems seem to be:
   unbalanced cohort/various patient groups with various
   preferences/multiple quality parameters (basic algorithm, signal
   propagation, battery, security and privacy, obtrusiveness,
   etc.)/multiple variants (operating modes, device settings)/variability
   of the device and of the environment. When we transform data into
   ``actionable knowledge{''}, especially if the generated decisions
   influence human health, utmost care has to be applied. The goal of this
   paper is to present the complexity of the problem, warn against hasty,
   purely technical solutions, raise interest among specialists in health
   statistics and ignite an interdisciplinary cooperation to solve it.},

Abstract = {Illegal use of electricity has been a major concern in power system
   industries for a long time. Fraudulent large-scale consumption of
   electricity may result in an unbalanced demand-supply gap. This study
   proposed a data-driven electricity theft detector that is based on
   random matrix theory with the widespread use of smart meters and
   advanced metering infrastructure. The application of an augmented matrix
   as the data source is the key step of the proposed method, indicating
   the correlations between power consumption and system operating states
   under abnormal conditions of electricity use. Moreover, the
   regional/individual theft detection algorithm and the abnormal
   consumption pattern signal are designed for shortlisting regions with a
   high probability of theft and selecting suspected fraudulent customers
   in real time. Numerical case studies using simulated case studies
   conducted on the IEEE 34-bus system and real data collected from the
   power system of a Chinese city are used to investigate the correctness
   and feasibility of the proposed method.},

Title = {DGLFV: Deep Generalized Label Algorithm for Finger-Vein Recognition},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {78594-78606},
Abstract = {With the growing demand for information security, finger-vein
   recognition has become widespread. However, the robustness of the
   recognition process becomes a major problem. When identifying unseen
   categories with traditional finger-vein recognition systems, a few
   issues remain, such as recognition interference and low efficiency. This
   paper proposes a Deep Generalized Label Finger-Vein (DGLFV) model to
   extract feature maps and achieve high-accuracy recognition. The largest
   rectangular finger-vein region is extracted through image semantic
   segmentation and the advanced bidirectional traversing and center
   diffusion method for the known categories. Then we generalize all the
   unseen categories actively as Class C + 1 to reduce interference from
   unregistered users. Furthermore, an adaptive threshold acquisition
   algorithm is proposed for Label Receiver Operating Characteristic
   (LROC), so that the procedures of classification, recognition, and
   verification are unified. Apart from Shandong University Homologous
   Multi-modal Traits (SDUMLA-HMT), we have conducted additional
   experiments on our self-built database, Finger Veins of Signal and
   Information Processing Laboratory (FV-SIPL). The recognition accuracy of
   the approach proposed in this paper has reached 99.25\% and 99.08\%
   testing on FV-SIPL and SDUMLA-HMT, with a low error rate at 1.481\% and
   2.228\% and little time consumption of 0.157s for a single image, which
   is better than most state-of-the-art finger-vein recognition methods.},

Abstract = {A multimodal biometric system is applied to recognize individuals as

   Multimodal biometrics increases the security level accuracy, spoof of
   attacks, noise in collected data, intra-class variations, inter-class
   variations, non universality etc. In this paper a multi modal biometric
   algorithm is designed by integrating iris, palm print, face and
   signature based on encoded discrete wavelet transform for image analysis
   and authentication. Multi level wavelet based fusion approach is
   applied, integrated and encoded into single composite image for matching
   decision. It reduces the memory size, increases the recognition accuracy
   and ERR using multimodal biometric approach when compared to individual
   biometric traits. The complexity of fusion and the reconstruction
   algorithm is suitable for many real time applications.},

Abstract = {Lewko and Waters introduced the computational hiding technique in
   Crypto'12. In their technique, two computational assumptions that
   achieve selective and co-selective security proofs lead to adaptive
   security of an encryption scheme. Later, pair encoding framework was
   introduced by Attrapadung in Eurocrypt'14. The pair encoding framework
   generalises the computational hiding technique for functional encryption
   (FE). It has been used to achieve a number of new FE schemes such as FE
   for regular languages and unbounded attribute based encryption allowing
   multi-use of attributes. Nevertheless, the generalised construction of
   Attrapadung's pair encoding for those schemes is adaptively secure only
   in composite order groups, which leads to efficiency loss. It remains a
   challenging task to explore constructions in prime order groups for
   gaining efficiency improvement, which leaves the research gap in the
   existing literature. In this work, we aim to address this drawback by
   proposing a new generalised construction for pair encodings in prime
   order groups. Our construction will lead to a number of new FE schemes
   in prime order groups, which have been previously introduced only in
   composite order groups by Attrapadung.},

Title = {Performance Comparison of Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and
   Extreme Learning Machine for Intrusion Detection},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {33789-33795},
Abstract = {Intrusion detection is a fundamental part of security tools, such as
   adaptive security appliances, intrusion detection systems, intrusion
   prevention systems, and firewalls. Various intrusion detection
   techniques are used, but their performance is an issue. Intrusion
   detection performance depends on accuracy, which needs to improve to
   decrease false alarms and to increase the detection rate. To resolve
   concerns on performance, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine
   (SVM), and other techniques have been used in recent work. Such
   techniques indicate limitations and are not effcient for use in large
   data sets, such as system and network data. The intrusion detection
   system is used in analyzing huge traffc data; thus, an effcient
   classifcation technique is necessary to overcome the issue. This problem
   is considered in this paper. Well-known machine learning techniques,
   namely, SVM, random forest, and extreme learning machine (ELM) are
   applied. These techniques are well-known because of their capability in
   classifcation. The NSL-knowledge discovery and data mining data set is
   used, which is considered a benchmark in the evaluation of intrusion
   detection mechanisms. The results indicate that ELM outperforms other
   approaches.},

Abstract = {System-of-Systems (SoS) result from the collaboration of independent
   Constituent Systems (CSs), connected in a certain configuration known as
   an architectural configuration, to achieve a common mission. The
   architectural configuration may change as new CS may join SoS and/or
   existing CS may leave SoS at runtime. These architectural configuration
   changes have affect on the overall system quality attributes (i.e.
   performance, security and reliability). Therefore, modelling SoS
   architecture is a challenging task as CSs and the possible architectural
   configurations are not entirely known at design time. Architectural
   description languages (ADLs) have been proposed and used to deal with
   SoS dynamic architecture. However, we still envision gaps to be bridged
   and challenges to be addressed in the forthcoming years. This paper
   outline a taxonomy for modeling SoS and provides a broad discussion on
   the state-of-the-art modeling notations to model and analyze SoS
   architectural configuration. An SoS case is presented to explain the
   impact of architectural configurational changes on the SoS properties.
   Besides, we also discuss challenges and future directions to be overcome
   in the forthcoming years.},

Title = {Outage-driven link selection for secure buffer-aided networks},
Journal = {SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate secure communication in a two-hop wireless
   network, where multiple buffer-aided relays assist to securely forward
   data from the sender to the destination threatened by a passive
   eavesdropper. To satisfy the security and delay requirements, we propose
   a novel link selection policy without the instantaneous wiretap channel
   state information. Different from the most current link selection
   policies, the proposed link selection policy is designed by joint
   considering the link secrecy outage probability and the buffer states.
   To evaluate the secrecy performance, we first characterize the system
   state transition matrix and the stationary state probability, and then
   derive the closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability
   and the secrecy rate. Moreover, we formulate a framework based on the
   queuing theory to analyze the end-to-end information delay at the
   source, the relays, and the queues, and derive the closed-form
   expression for the information delay. Finally, we conduct simulations to
   validate our theoretical performance analysis, and verify the
   performance improvement of the proposed outage-driven secure
   transmission scheme in terms of secrecy outage probability and
   information delay.},

Title = {Deep Muti-Modal Generic Representation Auxiliary Learning Networks for
   End-to-End Radar Emitter Classification},
Journal = {AEROSPACE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Radar data mining is the key module for signal analysis, where patterns
   hidden inside of signals are gradually available in the learning process
   and its superiority is significant for enhancing the security of the
   radar emitter classification (REC) system. Owing to the disadvantage
   that radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) caused by the imperfection of
   emitter's hardware is difficult to forge, current deep-learning REC
   methods based on deep-learning techniques, e.g., convolutional neural
   network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) are difficult to capture
   the stable RFF features. In this paper, an online and non-cooperative
   multi-modal generic representation auxiliary learning REC model, namely
   muti-modal generic representation auxiliary learning networks (MGRALN),
   is put forward. Multi-modal means that multi-domain transformations are
   unified to a generic representation. After this, the representation is
   employed to facilitate mining the implicit information inside of the
   signals and to perform the better model robustness, which is achieved by
   using the available generic genenation to guide the network training and
   learning. Online means the learning process of REC is only once and the
   REC is end-to-end. Non-cooperative denotes no demodulation techniques
   are used before the REC task. Experimental results on the measured civil
   aviation radar data demonstrate that the proposed method enables one to
   achieve superior performance.},

Title = {Bounded-collusion decentralized ABE with sublinear parameters},
Journal = {THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {960},
Month = {JUN 7},
Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a decentralized ABE scheme against bounded
   collusion which means the number of users in the system is a-prior
   bounded. The scheme enjoys public key and ciphertext of sublinear sizes
   in the number of users in the system while all prior constructions
   require linear sizes. Besides, our scheme achieves semi-adaptive
   security under bilateral k-Lin assumption and SXDH assumption in a
   pairing group. Keep the same as the previous constructions, the scheme
   supports monotone span program as a policy and does not rely on the
   random oracle. Technically, we follow Wang et al.'s ``linear secret
   sharing scheme (LSSS) + inner-product functional encryption (IPFE){''}
   paradigm {[}PKC'19] and use (an extended variant of) functional
   encryption for quadratic functions (QFE) in the place of IPFE. By this,
   we encrypt with sublinear-size random coins and later expand them to
   linear-size entropy for security proof. Roughly, the use of QFE requires
   bilateral k-Lin assumption while the entropy expansion relies on SXDH.

Abstract = {Numerous devices, from network switches and servers to industrial
   control systems, can be unreliable if they are not configured properly.
   Even if a device's implementation has been proven correct, it must still
   be configured to meet the specific functional and security requirements
   of its stakeholders.
   However, manual configuration remains labor intensive and error-prone
   even for experts. Automated configuration synthesis presents a promising
   way forward. Unfortunately, as we show, existing counterexample-guided
   algorithms can perform poorly if the system model allows configuration
   changes during execution. Yet disallowing such changes can hide
   significant problems, such as privilege escalation.
   We present a new synthesis algorithm that exploits structure inherent in
   state-machine models where the system configuration changes. We
   implement it using the Kodkod relational model finder, and show that it
   favorably solves a number of configuration-synthesis tasks.},

Abstract = {Recovery is a promising approach for building intrusion tolerant systems
   that remove or minimize the effects of malicious attacks. In this paper,
   a Virtualization-based Recovery approach for Intrusion Tolerance systems
   (VRIT) is proposed. We present the architecture of the VRIT, construct
   the state transition model of the VRIT, and analyze quantitatively the
   security of the VRIT system. We characterize the intrusion tolerance
   provided by the system through several measures defined on the model.
   Finally we have some simulation experiments to evaluate both the
   availability and the mean lime to security failure for the VRIT system.},

Abstract = {This work investigates the secrecy outage performance of
   decode-and-forward (DF) buffer-aided underlay cognitive relay networks
   (CRNs) with outdated channel state information (CSI) in the presence of
   an eavesdropper. The transmit power of the secondary users (SUs) is
   limited by the predefined interference threshold to guarantee the
   quality of service (QoS) requirement of the primary users (PUs). We
   adopt the max-link relay selection scheme, which can improve the secrecy
   performance by selecting the best link among all available
   source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links. Moreover, a closed-form
   expression of the secrecy outage probability is derived by modeling the
   state transition of the buffer as a Markov chain. Monte Carlo
   simulations validate the theoretical analysis. The findings of this
   paper demonstrate that the outdated CSI degrades the secrecy outage
   performance, but optimizing several parameters can improve the system
   secrecy performance significantly.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, most users access internet through mobile applications. The
   common way to authenticate users through websites forms is using
   passwords; while they are efficient procedures, they are subject to
   guessed or forgotten and many other problems. Additional multi modal
   authentication procedures are needed to improve the security. Behavioral
   authentication is a way to authenticate people based on their typing
   behavior. It is used as a second factor authentication technique beside
   the passwords that will strength the authentication effectively.
   Keystroke dynamic rhythm is one of these behavioral authentication
   methods. Keystroke dynamics relies on a combination of features that are
   extracted and processed from typing behavior of users on the touched
   screen and smart mobile users. This Research presents a novel analysis
   in the keystroke dynamic authentication field using two features
   categories: timing and no timing combined features. The proposed model
   achieved lower error rate of false acceptance rate with 0.1\%, false
   rejection rate with 0.8\%, and equal error rate with 0.45\%. A
   comparison in the performance measures is also given for multiple
   datasets collected in purpose to this research.},

Abstract = {Once defined, the access control policies and regulations would never be
   changed in a running and state transition process. However, it will give
   attackers the possibility of discovering vulnerabilities in the system,
   and the control systems lack the ability of dynamic perception of
   security state and risk, causing the systems to be exposed to risks. In
   this article, a dynamic Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model is proposed. The
   conditional random field (CRF) is introduced into the BLP model to
   optimize the rules. First, the model formalizes the security attributes,
   states of system, transition rules, and constraint models on the basis
   of the state transition of CRFs. After the historical system access logs
   are processed as the original dataset, a feature selection method is
   proposed to extract the requests and current states as feature vectors.
   Second, this article presents a rules training algorithm based on L-BFGS
   to implement the study and training of datasets, and then marks the logs
   in the test set through Viterbi algorithm automatically. On the base of
   these, a rule generation algorithm is proposed to dynamically adjust the
   access control rules based on the current security status and events of
   the system. Third, the security of CRFs-BLP is proved by theoretical
   analysis. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the model are verified
   by estimating the value of the precision, recall, and F1-score. As the
   system threats are shown to be decreased obviously from these
   experiments, this dynamic model can decrease the vulnerabilities and
   risk effectively.},

Abstract = {The paper describes the methodology of identifying an interference in
   the optical fiber. The paper presents the technology widely known as
   quantum key distribution. The quantum key distribution is based on the
   technique of constant comparison of quantum characteristics of the input
   light source and its characteristics at the end of the fiber optic.
   Methodology of presented work includes the evaluation of the functional
   objectives through the constructive assumptions for the laboratory
   models development. This paper presents the model of a system based on
   the comparison of polarization states of light quanta using two
   asymmetric Mach-Zender interferometers as transmitting and receiving
   systems to enable compensation of polarization state changes at the
   input and output of the fiber optics sensing cable. Continuous
   monitoring of the state of the reference signal, the specific changes of
   natural or ambient effects on the fiber will attempt to identify
   interference in the optical waveguide as a change of the polarization of
   the quantum states of the light. The authors indicate the possibility of
   using such fiber optic sensor as a security sensor to protect the
   extensive critical infrastructure facilities. In this article the future
   research conception of using compressed sensing algorithms for data
   compression in quantum key distribution systems is presented.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, Multimodal biometric is being deployed to overcome the
   challenges of spoofing which is encountered by unimodal biometrics.
   However, security is still compromised using multi modal biometric, thus
   requiring the attention of researchers. In view to increase security, an
   attempt of deploying multiple machine learning techniques on fused
   pattern have been explored and developed. Two enhanced algorithms of
   Chaotic Neural Network and NeuroEvolution of the augmenting topology
   have been devised and applied on the fused features. To verify the
   trustworthiness of the proposed system, several experiments have been
   deployed on both unimodal and multimodal systems. After several
   experiments performed, the algorithms reveal that multi biometric system
   exhibit higher recognition rates and lower false rejection rates
   compared to unimodal systems. In this research, we have also shown that
   algorithms have the possibility to countermeasure the loopholes that may
   occur at the matching module. We have achieved a good recognition rate
   of 99.1\% by adopting score level fusion by using the proposed
   NeuroEvolution of the augmenting topology algorithm compared to previous
   research work conducted. Thus, the proposed solution has proved to be
   stable while using fused features.},

Title = {Exploiting the Temporal Behavior of State Transitions for Intrusion
   Detection in ICS/SCADA},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {111171-111187},
Abstract = {Industrial Control Systems (ICS) monitor and control physical processes.
   The security of ICS has drawn the attention of many researchers since
   successful cyber-attacks against ICS can cause extensive damage in the
   physical world. Most of the existing literature describes solutions to
   protect an ICS against attacks directly targeting its underlying IT
   infrastructure. However, there are comparatively less works that focus
   on detecting cyber attacks against the physical process itself.
   Detection mechanisms that do so are said to be process aware. In this
   paper, we propose a time-based process aware intrusion detection system
   (IDS) that detects attacks against a physical process by leveraging its
   regular nature and temporal properties. The IDS learns the temporal
   behavior of the process variables and uses it to detect attacks. We
   evaluate the performance of our IDS on a public SCADA dataset and on a
   simulated SCADA system developed as part of this study, and we compare
   it with two other process-aware IDS proposed in the literature. The
   results show that our solution is able to detect attacks that are not
   detected by IDS that ignore temporal properties.},

Abstract = {Modern cyber attackers use sophisticated, highly-automated vulnerability
   search and exploit development tools to find new ways to break into
   target computers. To protect against such threats, we are developing
   FUZZBUSTER, a host-based adaptive security system that automatically
   discovers faults in hosted applications and incrementally refines and
   repairs the underlying vulnerabilities. To perform this self-adaptation,
   FUZZBUSTER uses meta-control to coordinate a diverse and growing set of
   custom and off-the-shelf fuzz-testing tools. FUZZBUSTER's greedy
   meta-control strategy considers adaptation deadlines, the exploit
   potential of vulnerabilities, the usage schedule of vulnerable
   applications, and the expected performance of its various fuzz-testing
   and adaptation tools. In this paper, we demonstrate how FUZZBUSTER's
   meta-control reasons efficiently about these factors, managing task
   selection to maximize the system's safety and effectiveness.},

Abstract = {In this modern era of the digital world, the patient's medical records
   are electronically maintained and updated for the maintenance of the
   good health. The electronically stored patients' health status is termed
   as the Electronic Patient Record (EPR). The EPR service includes the
   accessing, storage, and maintenance by the authenticated users. However,
   in the emergency situation, the EPR can be required by the
   unauthenticated users/physician. In these situations, the primary
   challenge is to prove the identity of an unknown physician/user. In
   these cases, there is a need for an adaptive security mechanism, where
   the adaptive mechanism includes intelligence to identify the emergency
   situation and adapt subsequently. In the health care, the privacy,
   integrity and access control over the generated data places an important
   role. To address these issues in this paper, we use a structural design
   that involves procedure based and distributed management in conviction
   to afford an elastic method to access the electronically stored records
   depending on the users' digital identification.},

Title = {Attractiveness of Bike-Sharing Stations from a Multi-Modal Perspective:
   The Role of Objective and Subjective Features},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {When analysing the performance of bike-sharing scheme (BSS) stations, it
   is common to find stations that are located in specific points that
   capture the interest of users, whereas nearby stations are clearly
   underused. This uneven behaviour is not totally understood. This paper
   discusses the potential factors influencing station attractiveness,
   supported by the related literature on cyclists' and pedestrians'
   preferences and the characteristics of the stations themselves. The
   existing literature addresses these topics independently, while this
   work unites them by proposing a non data-extensive methodology that
   allows the attractiveness of BSS stations to be assessed. Attractiveness
   in this context is understood as the set of physical, environmental and
   service-related features of a bike station that make it more appealing
   for BSS users than nearby stations. Special attention is paid to
   differentiating objective features, based on facts, from subjective
   features, those influenced by personal perceptions. This classification
   becomes important in this context because subjective aspects can change
   from one geographical location to another, making the findings related
   to these aspects difficult to apply to other regions. Moreover, the
   assessment of the stations' levels of safety and security is included.
   Thus, the proposed measure of attractiveness of BSS stations provides a
   balanced overview of several features. The consideration of station
   attractiveness when designing BSS layouts will help to refine the design
   of new layouts and will assist in conducting an appropriate diagnostic
   evaluation of the existing ones. This tool will allow urban and
   transportation planners to reduce re-balancing costs and to maximise
   user satisfaction at a low cost, which have a direct impact on improving
   the urban sustainability. The proposed method is applied to the Dublin
   bike sharing scheme, Dublinbikes, with good performance results.},

Title = {Continuous auditing and threat detection in multi-cloud infrastructure},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Efficient change control and configuration management is imperative for
   addressing the emerging security threats in cloud infrastructure. These
   threats majorly exploit misconfiguration vulnerabilities e.g. excessive
   permissions, disabled logging features and publicly accessible cloud
   storage buckets. Traditional security tools and mechanisms are unable to
   effectively and continuously track changes in cloud infrastructure owing
   to transience and unpredictability of cloud events. Therefore, novel
   tools that are proactive, agile and continuous are imperative. This
   article proposes CSBAuditor, a novel cloud security system that
   continuously monitors cloud infrastructure, to detect malicious
   activities and unauthorized changes. CSBAuditor leverages two concepts:
   state transition analysis and reconciler pattern to overcome the
   aforementioned security issues. Furthermore, security metrics are used
   to compute severity scores for detected vulnerabilities using a novel
   scoring system: Cloud Security Scoring System . CSBAuditor has been
   evaluated using various strategies including security chaos engineering
   (fault injection) strategies on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud
   Platform. CSBAuditor effectively detects misconfigurations in real-time
   with a detection rate of over 98\%. Also, the performance overhead is
   within acceptable limits. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Novel trusted execution support, as offered by Intel's Software Guard
   eXtensions (SGX), embeds seamlessly into user space applications by
   establishing regions of encrypted memory, called enclaves. Enclaves
   comprise code and data that is executed under special protection of the
   CPU and can only be accessed via an enclave defined interface. To
   facilitate the usability of this new system abstraction, Intel offers a
   software development kit (SGX SDK). While the SDK eases the use of SGX,
   it misses appropriate programming support for inter-enclave interaction,
   and demands to hardcode the exact use of trusted execution into
   applications, which restricts flexibility.
   This paper proposes EActors, an actor framework that is tailored to SGX
   and offers a more seamless, flexible and efficient use of trusted
   execution - especially for applications demanding multiple enclaves.
   EActors disentangles the interaction with enclaves and, among them, from
   costly execution mode transitions. It features lightweight fine-grained
   parallelism based on the concept of actors, thereby avoiding costly SGX
   SDK provided synchronisation constructs. Finally, EActors offers a high
   degree of freedom to execute actors, either untrusted or trusted,
   depending on security requirements and performance demands. We
   implemented two use cases on top of EActors: (i) a secure instant
   messaging service, and (ii) a secure multi-party computation service.
   Both illustrate the ability of EActors to seamlessly and effectively
   build secure applications. Furthermore, our performance evaluation
   results show that securing the messaging service with EActors improves
   performance compared to the vanilla versions of JabberD2 and ejabberd by
   up to 40x.},

Month = {2023 JUN 28},
Abstract = {It is very important to optimize the allocation of educational
   resources. Affected by big data environment fast development, the
   traditional education work is a huge challenge, a lot of information,
   the rapid spread of a variety of culture makes the college students body
   and mind has been a certain degree of harm, therefore, in the big data
   environment for innovation education resource configuration optimization
   can not only deeply in combination with the new situation, to create a
   new pattern of the education, and to explore new education ideas,
   Moreover, it can fully mobilize students' enthusiasm for learning and
   meet their requirements for innovative education in the environment of
   big data. It is possible to apply computer vision multimodal learning in
   the optimal allocation of innovative education resources in
   universities. At present, the innovative education method is relatively
   simple, and simple teaching videos and text materials can't meet the
   learning needs. Therefore, the multi-modal teaching mode of computer
   vision is needed to evaluate the effect. Based on multi-modal learning
   of computer vision, this article makes a deep discussion on the optimal
   allocation of innovative education resources in universities. This
   article studies the present situation of ideology instructional
   resources construction from the perspectives of the mode of ideology
   instructional resources construction, the overall characteristics and
   classification of educational network resources. Based on this, an
   ideology instructional resource model based on improved collaborative
   filtering algorithm is constructed. At the same time, according to the
   requirement analysis, the overall architecture of the system is
   designed. The framework is built on the JavaEE platform of the system.
   On this basis, the functional modules and databases are designed.
   Finally, the similarity calculation and resource recommendation are
   carried out by combining the interest preference feature model with the
   resource score. The improved algorithm in this article can effectively
   solve the problem of users' cold start and realize the personalized
   recommendation function of innovative education resources. Then promote
   the optimal allocation of innovative education resources in
   universities.},

Abstract = {The objective of this research is to develop a Virtual Teach Pendant for
   Android Cellphones (VTPAC) that is able to communicate with the robot
   model in the Visual Components software {[}11 {[}21. The VTPAC is a
   force multiplier that allows users to gain valuable teach pendant
   experience in labs with few robots, and makes the actual real-world
   robot time more valuable. It is also like a graduated driver's license
   where the student must prove some proficiency with the VTPAC before
   being allowed to get behind the wheel. The VTPAC will be used to operate
   the real robot system too and will allow people to be trained without
   using real robotic systems in very safe environment. The VTPAC can be
   used for industrial training and can be integrated in the academic
   programs, especially for online courses. In this research, the Fanuc LR
   Mate 200iC robot and the Visual Components software have been selected
   as a case study. These choices were made because ofthe easy access to
   the Fanuc LR Mate 200iC and this interface by reason of it can control
   the robot the same way as the Teach Pendant in the real world. Using the
   robot kinematic theory to understand the Teach Pendant commands, the
   code was developed such that it respects the operating mode of the robot
   and all the security operations needed. For the VTPAC development we
   used Python to communicate with the Visual Components software to work
   as a client for the software. This can allow users to utilize its own
   cellphone as the teach pendant and the software as the robot, having a
   more real experience in a safe environment. The VTPAC has been
   implemented and tested successfully.},

Abstract = {Flame detector is an important component of Furnace Safeguard
   Supervisory System (FSSS) and Burner management system. While boiler is
   under all operating modes, such as operating regularly and start-up and
   stop, they monitor the parameter and state of burning system
   continuously and closely, and make logical decision and calculation
   constantly. In the necessary time, they send out operating commands to
   ensure the security of burning system of boiler. In this paper, the
   development of traditional methods and image processing method of flame
   detection of boiler are analyzed. The author consider the priority
   should be given to image processing method in flame detection of boiler,
   and also a way to detect the combustion center and temperature

Title = {Creating dual-mode luminescence in piezoelectric calcium niobates
   through lanthanide-doped for anti-counterfeiting and temperature sensing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {856},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Lanthanide-doped luminescent materials have been widely used in the
   field of information security and optical sensing, owing to their unique
   optical properties. However, conventional luminescent materials usually
   exhibit unicolor and single-peak emission, which leads to a decrease in
   the application efficiency of anti-counterfeiting and optical
   temperature sensing. In this work, we have successfully developed a
   series of novel multi-mode stimulation luminescent materials in the
   Ca2Nb2O7 system via the solid phase reaction. This luminescent material
   is synthesized by doping dual lanthanide ions to realize adjustable
   multi-mode luminescence, which simultaneously create luminescent centers
   and carrier traps in the host lattice. The multi-colored emission can be
   realized under different excitation wavelengths. Meanwhile, it has a
   combination of fluorescent phenomenon by upconversion, down-shifting and
   thermal stimulation. In addition, the fluorescence intensity ratio of
   lanthanide ions shows significant temperature dependence, and the
   maximum S-r is 0.0072 K-1 at 293 K. Hence, we have fabricated a novel
   material that can be used for multi-mode anti-counterfeiting and optical
   temperature sensing. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Since the early 1970s, utilities have included transmission network
   evaluation tools in their Energy Control Center application. Originally,
   these tools were very limited, but in recent years have expanded to
   include optimal power flow, advanced security analysis and remedial
   action software. Although these codes have been successfully installed
   and demonstrated, very little actual me has occurred because of the
   limitations in the user interface and facilities to easily update the
   operational status of the devices in the model. System operator's
   acceptance of advanced network functions and integration into their
   daily work functions has been accomplished at Houston Lighting and Power
   Company by redesigning the user interface and many of the associated
   systems needed to provide the correct operating state to the network
   models. This paper provides insights into the applications and how they
   were modified to simplify the user interface. The paper describes a
   standard by which the success of the user interface and the completeness
   of the automatic update to models can be measured. The paper includes a
   list of System Dispatcher task assignments and concludes with a survey
   of the benefits HL\&P has obtained from system operator use of network
   applications functions.},

Abstract = {The Distributed Object Kernel is a federated database system providing a
   set of services which allow cooperative processing across different
   databases. The focus of this paper is the design of a DOK security
   service that provides for enforcing both local security policies,
   related to the security of local autonomous databases, and federated
   security policies, governing access to data aggregates composed of data
   from multiple distributed databases. We propose Global Access Control,
   an extended access control mechanism enabling a uniform expression of
   heterogeneous security information. Mappings from existing Mandatory and
   Discretionary Access Controls are described. To permit the control of
   data aggregation, the derivation of unauthorized information from
   authorized data, our security framework provides a logic-based language,
   the Federated Logic Language (FELL), which can describe constraints on
   both single and multiple states of the federation. To enforce
   constraints, FELL statements are mapped to state transition graphs which
   model the different subcomputations required to check the aggregation
   constraints, Graph aggregation operations are proposed for building
   compound state transition graphs for complex constraints. To monitor
   aggregation constraints, two marking techniques, called Linear Marking
   Technique and Zigzag Marking Technique, are proposed. Finally, we
   describe a three-layer DOK logical secure architecture enabling the
   implementation of the different security agents. This includes a
   Coordination layer, a Task layer, and a Database layer. Each contains
   specialized agents that enforce a different part of the federated
   security policy, Coordination is performed by the DOK Manager, enforcing
   security is performed by a specialized Constraint Manager agent, and the
   database functions are implemented by user and data agents.},

Abstract = {Wind-diesel power systems (WDPS) are isolated microgrids which combine
   diesel generators (DGs) with wind turbine generators (WTGs). The WDPS
   modelled in this study consists of one 275 kW-WTG, one 300 kVA-DG, a 240
   V/390.625 Ah Ni-MH battery energy storage system (BESS) and consumer
   load. The WDPS working modes considered are: Wind Diesel (WD) mode where
   both the DG and WTG supply power and wind-only (WO) mode where only the
   WTG produces active power. First, the dynamic models of the enumerated
   WDPS components are described. Then, WDPS control requirements in WD and
   WO modes are studied and a control system to govern the
   consumed/supplied BESS active power is presented. Finally, the WDPS is
   simulated and graphs of the system frequency and voltage, active power
   in each component and the battery current/voltage/state of charge are
   shown. The simulations cover: the WD mode, where it is shown that the
   BESS filters the load and WTG power variations and avoids a DG reverse
   power situation, the WD to WO mode transition where the BESS makes
   possible a bumpless transition and the WO mode where the BESS regulates
   the system frequency. Simulations demonstrate that the BESS increases
   the WDPS stability, reliability and security.},

Abstract = {Designing and implementing security-critical systems, correctly is
   difficult. In practice, most vulnerabilities arise from bugs in
   implementations. We present work towards systematic specification-based
   testing of security-critical systems using the CASE tool AutoFocus.
   Cryptographic systems are formally specified with state transition
   diagrams, a notation for state machines in the AutoFocus system. We show
   how to systematically generate test sequences for security properties
   based on the model that can be used to test the implementation for
   vulnerabilities, In particular, we focus on the principle of
   fail-safety. We explain our method at the example of a part of the
   Common Electronic Purse Specifications (CEPS).
   Most commonly, attacks address vulnerabilities in the way security
   mechanisms are used, rather than the mechanisms themselves. Being able
   to treat security aspects with a general CASE tool within the context of
   system development enables detection of such vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {The use of new technologies in vehicles, such as automation and
   connectivity, results in the addition of more software components, which
   in turn increases the potential vulnerabilities and attack surfaces for
   the vehicle. To address this, cybersecurity monitoring of vehicle fleets
   is required to detect and respond to potential cyber threats and
   vulnerabilities. The aim of this research is to explore a technological
   approach to fleet monitoring using established IT standards and
   techniques. The approach involves collecting, filtering, and forwarding
   cybersecurity information from multiple sources within the vehicle by
   instrumenting the ROS 2-based architecture and integrating these data
   sources with the log management tool syslog-ng. The logging
   configuration can be adapted at runtime using a ROS 2 interface that we
   developed. The approach is demonstrated with our fleet simulation setup
   ``Fleet in the Loop{''} and a sophisticated data collection in a
   Knowledge Graph. The approach at hand can be used to seamlessly
   integrate ROS 2 in common IT monitoring tools and efficiently increase
   the resilience of vehicles by integrating adaptive security monitoring.},

Title = {Pumped storage system model and experimental investigations on S-induced
   issues during transients},
Journal = {MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {90},
Pages = {350-364},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Because of the important role of pumped storage stations in the peak
   regulation and frequency control of a power grid, pump turbines must
   rapidly switch between different operating modes, such as fast startup
   and load rejection. However, pump turbines go through the unstable S
   region in these transition processes, threatening the security and
   stability of the pumped storage station. This issue has mainly been
   investigated through numerical simulations, while field experiments
   generally involve high risks and are difficult to perform. Therefore, in
   this work, the model test method was employed to study S-induced
   security and stability issues for a pumped storage station in transition
   processes. First, a pumped storage system model was set up, including
   the piping system, model units, electrical control systems and
   measurement system. In this model, two pump turbines with different
   S-shaped characteristics were installed to determine the influence of
   S-shaped characteristics on transition processes. The model platform can
   be applied to simulate any hydraulic transition process that occurs in
   real power stations, such as load rejection, startup, and grid
   connection. On the experimental platform, the S-shaped characteristic
   curves were measured to be the basis of other experiments. Runaway
   experiments were performed to verify the impact of the S-shaped
   characteristics on the pump turbine runaway stability. Full load
   rejection tests were performed to validate the effect of the S-shaped
   characteristics on the water-hammer pressure. The condition of one pump
   turbine rejecting its load after another defined as one-after-another
   (OAA) load rejection was performed to validate the possibility of
   S-induced extreme draft tube pressure. Load rejection experiments with

Abstract = {A (public key) Trace and Revoke Scheme combines the functionality of
   broadcast encryption with the capability of traitor tracing.
   Specifically, (1) a trusted center publishes a single public key and
   distributes individual secret keys to the users of the system; (2)
   anybody can encrypt a message so that all but a specified subset of
   ``revoked{''} users can decrypt the resulting ciphertext; and (3) if a
   (small) group of users combine their secret keys to produce a ``pirate
   decoder{''}, the center can trace at least one of the ``traitors{''}
   given access to this decoder. We construct the first chosen ciphertext
   (CCA2) secure Trace and Revoke Scheme based on the DDH assumption. Our
   scheme is also the first adaptively secure scheme, allowing the
   adversary to corrupt players at any point during execution, while prior
   works (e.g., {[}14, 16]) only achieves a very weak form of non-adaptive
   security even against chosen plaintext attacks.
   Of independent interest, we present a slightly simpler construction that
   shows a ``natural separation{''} between the classical notion of
   CCA2-security and the recently proposed {[}15, 1] relaxed notion of
   gCCA2-security.},

Abstract = {Power grids in China are in the stage of rapid development of UHV AC and
   DC. Cascading failures with timing and propagation characteristics
   become the main threat to power grid security. Based on the EMS and WAMS
   information and according to the principle of practicality, a
   practicable scheme for cascading failure prediction and analysis is
   proposed. And the related analysis system has been developed. In line
   with the timing development characteristics of cascading failures, the
   overall system layered architecture and key technologies are proposed.
   The access relationship of the main sub-function modules of the system
   is explained. Firstly, the EMS and WAMS multiple source data integration
   technologies are described. Furthermore, comprehensively considering the
   variation of power grid structure and state changes, the vulnerability
   component set identification is realized. Thirdly, on the basis of the
   set of vulnerability elements, the full dynamic process simulation
   program is used to select and check progressive cascading fault sets
   automatically, which can consider the effects of relay protection and
   security control equipment. Finally, in view of the possible serious
   faults, aiming at the weak section in the fault propagation path, the
   corresponding power flow auxiliary adjustment strategy is presented.},

Abstract = {Facial Recognition is a type of biometric software application that can
   identify a specific individual in a digital image by analyzing and
   comparing patterns. These systems are commonly used for the security
   purposes but are increasingly being used in a variety of other
   applications such as residential security, voter verification, banking
   using ATM. Changes in facial expression become a difficult task in
   recognizing faces. In this paper continuous naturalistic affective
   expressions will be recognized using Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
   framework. Active Appearance Model (AAM) landmarks are considered for
   each frame of the videos. The AAMs were used to track the face and
   extract its visual features. There are six different facial expressions
   considered over here: Happy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust,
   Fear and Sad. Different Expression recognition problem is solved through
   a multistage automatic pattern recognition system where the temporal
   relationships are modeled through the HMM framework. Dimension levels
   (Le., labels) can be defined as the hidden states sequences in the HMM
   framework. Then the probabilities of these hidden states and their state
   transitions can be accurately computed from the labels of the training
   set. Through a three stage classification approach, the output of a
   first-stage classification is used as observation sequences for a second
   stage classification, modeled as a HMM-based framework. The k-NN will be
   used for the first stage classification. A third classification stage, a
   decision fusion tool, is then used to boost overall performance.},

Abstract = {With the rapid increase of wind power centralized grid-connection scale,
   the security and stability of power grid are greatly affected. In order
   to simulate the dynamic characteristics of wind farm accurately, a
   large-scale wind power online equivalent method based on multi-source
   data fusion is proposed. The operating state of the state estimation
   modeling network is identified by the fusion of multi-source real-time
   data such as SCADA, PMU and security and stability control system. When
   the error of branch power flow or node voltage at the boundary is large,
   the active power regulation range of wind power generators is determined
   by comprehensively considering the actual measurement collected by the
   wind farm centralized control system and the prediction information of
   the wind power prediction system. The active power of each wind farm is
   determined by quadratic programming model. The wind power generators are
   grouped according to the topology in the wind farm, then each group is
   subdivided according to static characteristic and operating state in
   turn. The dynamic models and static parameters of equivalent wind power
   generators and equivalent transformers are calculated. The proposed
   method is proved to be fast and effective through the analysis of a
   practical power grid example.},

Abstract = {A new approach based on fuzzy set theory is developed for contingency
   ranking of Taiwan power system. To examine whether a power system can
   remain in a secure and reliable operating state under contingency
   conditions, those contingency cases that will result in loss-of-load,
   loss-of-generation, or islanding are first identified. Then IP-IQ
   iteration of fast decoupled load flow is performed to estimate
   post-contingent quantities (line flows, bus voltages) for other
   contingency cases. Bawd on system operators' past experience, each
   post-contingent quantity is assigned a degree of severity according to
   the potential damage that could be imposed on the power system by the
   quantity, should the contingency occurs. Since human experts tend to use
   linguistic  variables to describe the degree of severity, uncertainty or
   imprecision exists in knowledge representation. An approach bawd on
   fuzzy wt theory is developed to deal with the imprecision of linguistic
   terms With the degree of severity for each quantity in a contingency caw
   described by a fuzzy set, a set of fuzzy reasoning procedures are
   developed to generate the overall degree of severity for each
   contingency case. Those contingency cases with high degree of severity
   are provided to system operators for further examination in order to
   decide whether appropriate actions should be taken. Since the operators'
   heuristic rules are taken into account in the reasoning procedure, it is
   expected that those contingency cases, which are potentially harmful to
   the system bawd on previous experience, will be picked out by the
   proposed method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
   demonstrated by contingency ranking of Taiwan power system which
   consists of 170 buses, 121 lines, and 86 transformers.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {114},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cyber-Physical-Social Space (CPSS) is a promising paradigm to provide
   people with an intelligent environment by emphasizing the deep fusion of
   cyberspace, physical space, and social space. The interdependence of
   these spaces makes that CPSS is more likely to be attacked. The attack
   consequences may directly affect the state of the physical world and
   even endanger the people's life. Thus, the most challenging issue for
   CPSS is to ensure the space security. However, existing security
   analysis methods focus on the static analysis at the design phase. They
   do not consider the open and dynamic characteristics which are the core
   features of CPSS. In this paper, we propose an adaptive security
   analysis framework for CPSS to prevent the unauthorized flow of
   information. Firstly, the access control model of CPSS is proposed. It
   controls the access behaviors by considering the space information
   covering the social, cyber, and physical spaces. Secondly, Labelled
   Transition System (LTS) is established to describe the future evolutions
   of CPSS. The space states in the LTS which violate the security
   requirements are reasoned by the model checking technology. Thirdly, a
   policy adjustment method is proposed to prevent the system from entering
   the violated states or mitigate the bad results caused by the
   violations. In the end, the effectiveness of our approach is evaluated
   by a smart building case, and the necessity of our approach is analyzed
   by the performance evaluation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Hyperchaotic circuit design based on memristor and its application in
   image encryption},
Journal = {MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {265},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The active-circuit simulation of magnetron memristors model and
   sinusoidal functions are introduced into a simple third-order memristor
   chaotic system to obtain a self-replicating chaotic system based on the
   memristor. The most remarkable feature is the existence of state
   transfer in this system, which has infinite line equilibria and exhibits
   extreme multistability with the coexistence of an infinite number of
   attractors. The system is a chaotic system with a wide range of
   parameters, and there is a transfer from periodic to chaotic to
   hyperchaotic states in a specific parameter range. The experimental
   simulation circuit was not only developed based on the circuit
   simulation software Multisim, but also the actual digital circuit of the
   system was implemented by field pro-grammable gate array (FPGA). The
   final experimental results were consistent with the numerical
   simulation, which proved that the constructed system was feasible.
   Finally, an image encryption algorithm is designed in combination with
   DNA algorithm, so that the new system chaotic sequence is used to
   encrypt images, focusing on the analysis of encryption histogram,
   adjacent pixel correlation. The results show that the new memristor
   system is very sensitive to both chaotic keys and plaintexts, the key
   space is large, therefore the proposed chaotic memristor system has high
   security performance when applied to image encryption.},

Title = {Centralized Microgrid Control System in Compliance with IEEE 2030.7
   Standard Based on an Advanced Field Unit},
Journal = {ENERGIES},

Abstract = {The necessity for the utilization of microgrids emerges from the
   integration of distributed energy resources, electric vehicles, and
   battery storage systems into the conventional grid structure. In order
   to achieve a proper operation of the microgrid, the presence of a
   microgrid control system is crucial. The IEEE 2030.7 standard defines
   the microgrid control system as a key element of the microgrid that
   regulates every aspect of it at the point-of-interconnection with the
   distribution system, and autonomously manages operations such as the
   transitions of operating modes. In this paper, a microgrid control
   system is developed to achieve real-time monitoring and control through
   a centralized approach. The controller consists of a centralized server
   and advanced field units that are also developed during this work. The
   control functions of the centralized server ensure the proper operation
   during grid-connected and island modes, using the real-time data
   received via the advanced field unit. The developed server and the field
   unit constitute a complete system solution. The server is composed of
   control function and communication, database, and user interface
   modules. The microgrid control functions comprise dispatch and
   transition core-level functions. A rule-based core-level dispatch
   function guarantees the security of supply to critical loads during the
   islanded mode. The core-level transition function accomplishes a
   successful transition between the operation modes. Moreover, a
   communication framework and a graphical user interface are implemented.
   The presented system is tested through thecases based on the IEEE 2030.8
   standard.},

Abstract = {Several broadcast encryption (BE) constructions have been proposed since
   Fiat and Naor introduced the concept, some achieving short parameters
   size while others achieve better security. Since 1994, a lot of
   alternatives to BE have moreover been additionally proposed, such as the
   broadcast and trace (BT) primitive which is a combination of broadcast
   encryption and traitor tracing. Among the other variants of BE, the
   notion of augmented BE (AugBE), introduced by Boneh and Waters in 2006,
   corresponds to a BE scheme with the particularity that the encryption
   algorithm takes an index as an additional parameter. If an AugBE scheme
   is both message and index hiding, it has been proved that it can
   generically be used to construct a secure BT scheme. Hence, any new
   result related to the former gives an improvement to the latter. In this
   paper, we first show that both BE and AugBE can be obtained by using an
   identity-based encryption scheme with wildcard (WIBE). We also introduce
   the new notion of anonymous AugBE, where the used users set is hidden,
   and prove that it implies index hiding. We then provide two different
   WIBE constructions. The first one has constant size ciphertext and used
   to construct a new constant size ciphertext BE scheme with adaptive CPA
   security, in the standard model (under the SXDH assumption). The second
   WIBE provides pattern-hiding, a new definition we introduced, and serves
   as a basis for the first anonymous AugBE scheme (and subsequently a BT
   scheme since our scheme is also index hiding by nature) in the
   literature, with adaptive security in the standard model (under the
   XDLin assumption).},

   and information of the insulated gloves and electric test pen with
   ZigBee by the way of wireless transmission, and then, this system
   analyses these information and outputs risk phenomena by physical
   simulation. If operational errors, the system will trigger a variety of
   simulated accident devices, resulting in highlight flash, smoke,
   explosion, and a strong electric shock feeling. By this way, the
   operator can understand the serious consequence that is caused by wrong

Abstract = {This paper presents a data-centric middleware responsible for real-time
   communication and data storage in smart grids. The middleware offers a
   high level programming model that provides ways of storing/getting
   information from/to the grid and encrypts messages thus providing a
   secure message exchange. The design has taken into account the
   heterogeneity of devices, software platforms and stakeholders involved
   in this kind of Cyber-physical System (CPS). A modular vision is
   followed in such a way that middleware components can be easily adapted
   to different platforms and a simple data interface is provided by using
   REST (Representational State Transfer) web services and a high level
   asynchronous API. The middleware has been used in the context of a
   European project (e-balance) where soft real-time requirements, security
   and low capacity devices were some of the requirements. The
   demonstration scenarios are detailed in this paper together with the
   validation tests that show that the use of this programming abstraction
   is feasible.},

Abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have deeply influenced the working and
   living styles of human beings. Information security and privacy for WSN
   is particularly crucial. Cryptographic algorithms are extensively
   exploited in WSN applications to ensure the security. They are usually
   implemented in specific chips to achieve high data throughout with less
   computational resources. Cryptographic hardware should be rigidly tested
   to guarantee the correctness of encryption operation. Scan design
   improves significantly the test quality of chips and thus is widely used
   in semiconductor industry. Nevertheless, scan design provides a backdoor
   for attackers to deduce the cipher key of a cryptographic core. To
   protect the security of the cryptographic system we first present a
   secure scan architecture, in which an automatic test control circuitry
   is inserted to isolate the cipher key in test mode and clear the
   sensitive information at mode switching. Then, the weaknesses of this
   architecture are analyzed and an enhanced scheme using concept of test
   authorization is proposed. If the correct authorization key is applied
   within the specific time, the normal test can be performed. Otherwise,
   only secure scan test can be performed. The enhanced scan scheme ensures
   the security of cryptographic chips while remaining the advantages of
   scan design.},

Abstract = {Speaker recognition systems, even though they have been around for four
   decades, have not been widely considered as standalone systems for
   biometric security because of their unacceptably low performance, i.e.,
   high false acceptance and rejection. Research has shown that speaker
   recognition performance can be enhanced through hybrid fusion (HF) of
   likelihood scores generated by arithmetic harmonic sphericity (AHS) and
   hidden Markov model (HMM) techniques {[}1]. Performance improvements of
   22\% and 6\% true acceptance rate (TAR) at 5\% false acceptance rate
   (FAR) were observed, when evaluated on two different datasets- YOHO and
   USF multi-modal biometric dataset respectively. In this paper, we
   present a model that combines accent information from an accent
   classification (AC) system with HF system in order to further increase
   the speaker recognition rate. The proposed system achieved performance
   improvements of 17\% and 15\% TAR at an FAR of 3\% when evaluated on SAA
   and USF datasets. The accent incorporation method discussed in this work
   can also be applied to any other speaker recognition system.},

Title = {Fusion of finger types. for fingerprint indexing using minutiae
   quadruplets},
Journal = {PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {38},
Pages = {8-14},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Accuracy, security and efficiency are the drivers for exploiting
   multibiometric systems. A multi-modal or multibiometric system is
   relatively more secure than a single-biometric system as a result of the
   rich biometric content, lower error rates and resilience to impostor
   attacks. The availability and easy acquisition of the ten prints of an
   individual with fewer resources, give multi-finger biometric fusion
   scheme an advantage over other fusion schemes based on different
   biometric modalities. In this paper, multi-finger indexing is proposed
   using minutiae quadruplets in combination with a clustering scheme.
   Four, five and ten fingerprints from a subject are fused at the rank
   level using the highest rank rule. The minutiae quadruplet features are
   observed to be robust and the clustering scheme assists in quickly
   identifying a list of potential candidates in the gallery database.
   Results from the experiments show good performance of the fusion scheme
   with minutiae quadruplet features in fingerprint indexing. (C) 2013

Title = {Secure olympics games with technology: Intelligent border surveillance
   for the 2022 Beijing winter olympics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {129},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Building a border surveillance system with integrated surveillance
   technologies is a crucial security strategy for Olympic venues. Although
   the previous Olympic Games have a long history of using surveillance
   technologies, there are perennial challenges in terms of false alarms,
   energy consumption, and labor and capital costs. In this paper, an
   IoT-based multi-agent intelligent border surveillance method with less
   cost is proposed. Following a two-level autonomous mechanism, the method
   assures agent-level self-patrolling by distributed nodes and
   system-level multi-agent surveillance task coordination by the central
   server. The core entity of each distributed node is the IoT-based
   SmartGM, an autonomous surveillance tower integrating multi-modal
   surveillance devices. Finally, based on intelligent visual reasoning
   algorithms, the proposed activation strategy updates surveillance
   devices' activation status simultaneously according to global states,
   ensuring long-term operation. This method has been successfully applied
   in the ski venue of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.},

Abstract = {A recent trend of the information technology is cloud computing
   technology where many complex tasks are simplified with increased speed
   and low cost. However, cloud authentication plays a crucial role once
   all the data's are uploaded in the cloud. In this paper, multi-biometric
   template security based on generation of unique graph is proposed to
   ensure a safe and secured cloud authentication mechanism. To overcome
   the vulnerability issues of traditional password and token based
   authentication methods, in this work, a multi-biometric system is
   proposed. The left, right fingerprint and palm print multi modal traits
   are given as input to the system. After preprocessing, all the features
   are combined to generate a weighted graph called as branching factor
   graph. In the end, the node and edge values of the branching factor
   graph will be stored in the cloud database. Experimental study shows
   that the proposed method achieved a very low equal error rate than the
   other existing works.},

Title = {Two-Level Parallel Augmented Schur Complement Interior-Point Algorithms
   for the Solution of Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow Problems},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Modern power grids incorporate renewable energy at an increased pace,
   placing greater stress on the power grid equipment and shifting their
   operational conditions towards their limits. As a result, failures of
   any network component, such as a transmission line or power generator,
   can be critical to the overall grid operation. The security constrained
   optimal power flow (SCOPF) aims for the long term precontingency
   operating state, such that in the event of any contingency, the power
   grid will remain secure. For a realistic power network, however, with
   numerous contingencies considered, the overall problem size becomes
   intractable for single-core optimization tools in short time frames
   established by real-time industrial operations. We propose a parallel
   distributed memory structure exploiting framework, BELTISTOS-SC, which
   accelerates the solution of SCOPF problems over state of the art
   techniques. The acceleration on single-core execution is achieved by a
   structure-exploiting interior point method, employing successive Schur
   complement evaluations to further reduce the size of the systems solved
   at each iteration while maintaining sparsity, resulting in lower
   computational resources for the linear system solution. Additionally the
   parallel, distributed memory implementation of the proposed framework is
   also presented in detail and validated through several large-scale
   examples, demonstrating its efficiency for large-scale SCOPF problems.},

Title = {Multi-objective Optimization Response Modeling to Contaminated Water
   Distribution Networks: Pressure Driven versus Demand Driven Analysis},
Journal = {KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {21},
Number = {6},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Implementation of management strategies following contamination
   detection in water distribution networks may extensively change
   operational mode of nominated valves and hydrants. The commonly used
   demand driven network solvers may fail to realistically represent
   system's performances of new topology due to possible pressure-deficient
   condition. Realizing their drawbacks, this paper integrates a Pressure
   Driven Network Solver (PDNS) with multi-objective Non-dominated Sorting
   Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) in a simulation-optimization scheme. It
   is illustrated that the two commonly used objective functions, namely
   minimization of consumed contamination mass and number of polluted
   nodes, may be in conflict when an operational strategy is implemented. A
   trade-off is developed to help decision-maker compromise between
   restraining spatial spread of contaminant and its risk to public health.
   Decision variables in this optimization model are valve closure and
   hydrant opening. Each trial solution developed by the NSGA-II addresses
   a new system topology by changing operational modes of the nominated
   valves and hydrants. The PDNS determines the nodal pressures and refines
   the nodal withdraw for trial solution. To illustrate the performance of
   the proposed methodology, Net3 from EPANET 2 is employed. The results
   show that the pressure-driven analysis is more realistic and appropriate
   in comparison with demand-driven analysis in operational conditions.},

Abstract = {This work presents a new weighting algorithm for biometric sources
   within a score-level multi-biometric system. Those weights are used in
   the effective and widely used weighted sum fusion rule to produce
   multi-biometric decisions. The presented solution is mainly based on the
   characteristic of the overlap region between the genuine and imposter
   scores distributions. It also integrates the performance of the
   biometric source represented by its equal error rate. This solution aims
   at avoiding the shortcomings of previously proposed solutions such as
   low generalization abilities and sensitiveness to outliers. The proposed
   solution is evaluated along with the state of the art and best practice
   techniques. The evaluation was performed on two databases, the Biometric
   Scores Set BSSR1 and the Extended Multi Modal Verification for
   Tele-services and Security applications database and a satisfying and
   stable performance was achieved.},

Abstract = {Information security is an issue of serious global concern. The
   development of Internet increases the security risk of information
   systems greatly. This paper utilizes HMM (Hidden Markov Model) to
   realize the forecast ability of IDS (Intrusion Detection System). In
   this model, a command sequence or a control information sequence is
   regarded as a series of state transitions with a certain probability.
   The performance of several algorithms is compared such as F-BP
   (Forward-Back Propagation) algorithm, Viterbi Learning algorithm, EM
   (Expectation Maximization) algorithm, etc. In order to provide a soft
   boundary to the decision-making, fuzzy math is also introduced to this
   model. By this means, the intelligence of the IDS is improved and some
   decision-making abilities and reasoning abilities are offered to IDS. As
   well this paper reports the results about our project.},

Abstract = {Face detection is a common image processing task in applications such as
   pedestrian monitoring, crowd flow prediction, security video
   surveillance, and fever screening. Thermal imaging is used in
   conjunction with a visible light camera for improved monitoring of
   people. Often information from multi-modal sources such as IR/visible
   images is fused for efficient face detection. The accuracy of the face
   detection system relies on the quality of the image registration
   procedure. In this paper, we propose an enhanced intensity-based image
   registration technique for thermal and visible facial images. The method
   uses a histogram matching scheme to equalize the intensity levels of the
   IR/visible images for proper image registration. The proposed scheme
   when validated with facial images shows an improved registration quality
   when quantified using structural similarity (SSIM) and mutual
   information (MI) metric for facial IR and visible images.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a new computer network-facilitated voltage stability
   control strategy for electricity power distribution systems connected
   with distributed generations. The proposed strategy aims to determine
   stability enhancement operations on two aspects: one is to increase
   power system operation security during normal conditions, and the other
   is to save a distribution system from imminent voltage collapse due to
   contingencies. The operations include coordinated local generating, load
   tap changing, load shedding, etc. This paper shows the use of
   state-of-the-art digital signal processing technology for determining
   correct operation security enhancement and voltage instability controls,
   and the application of modern computer networking technology for
   monitoring of distribution system operating states and transmitting of
   data and stability control commands. This paper presents the design of a
   new architecture for network monitoring, data transmitting, and control

Title = {Dynamic Security Assessment of Small-Signal Stability for Power Grids
   Using Windowed Online Gaussian Process},

Abstract = {The online small-signal stability assessment of electrical power grids
   is typically a challenging problem due to uncertainties and parameter
   variations of power system dynamics as well as the incurred high
   computational complexity. This paper proposes a novel theoretical
   framework for dynamic small-signal stability assessment of power grids
   by estimating the region of attraction (ROA) for operating states in
   real time. By analyzing the latest sampling data of power grids in a
   fixed time window, an up-to-date training set is constructed with the
   aid of converse Lyapunov function, which enables us to develop an online
   learning approach based on Gaussian Process (GP) to assess the stability
   level of power grids. As a result, an iteration algorithm is designed to
   update the assessment parameters by learning the input-output pairs in
   the training set. Theoretical analysis is conducted to ensure the
   existence of converse Lyapunov function for differential-algebraic
   system that serves to describe power system dynamics, as well as to
   estimate the region of attraction for operating states with a given
   confidence level. In particular, a practical method is proposed to
   leverage time series of phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements
   including voltage/current magnitude, phase and frequency (i.e., PMU
   data) of real power grids for validating the online GP approach.
   Moreover, validations are taken to substantiate the proposed approach by
   using PMU data of real smart-grid infrastructure and IEEE test cases.
   The proposed assessment approach contributes to situational awareness of
   human operators in the control station, thereby taking proactive
   remedial actions prior to emergencies.},

Abstract = {The objective of the proposed controller is to ensure that the system is
   always in a secure state with no system component being overloaded, even
   under changing load conditions. In addition the controller ensures that
   the conventional requirements such as Automatic Generation Control (AGC)
   and Economic Load Dispatch (ELD) are met. The controller makes use of
   the system measurements obtained through Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition (SCADA) systems and evaluates incremental changes to the
   control variables as and when necessary. The incremental changes are
   such that the system operating state will move towards the optimal state
   in which the objectives of the controller are achieved. Unlike the
   conventional Optimal Power Flow (OPF) methods which inherently solve the
   power system model to determine the optimal operating point, the
   proposed controller solves only a set of controller equations. The
   scheme is implemented for real power dispatch and is tested for its
   efficacy on a dynamic power system simulator.},

Abstract = {Wide-area protection and control (WAPAC) systems are widely applied in
   the energy management system (EMS) that rely on a wide-area
   communication network to maintain system stability, security, and
   reliability. As technology and grid infrastructure evolve to develop
   more advanced WAPAC applications, however, so do the attack surfaces in
   the grid infrastructure. This paper presents an attack-resilient system
   (ARS) for the WAPAC cybersecurity by seamlessly integrating the network
   intrusion detection system (NIDS) with intrusion mitigation and
   prevention system (IMPS). In particular, the proposed NIDS utilizes
   signature and behavior-based rules to detect attack reconnaissance,
   communication failure, and data integrity attacks. Further, the proposed
   IMPS applies state transition-based mitigation and prevention strategies
   to quickly restore the normal grid operation after cyberattacks. As a
   proof of concept, we validate the proposed generic architecture of ARS
   by performing experimental case study for wide-area protection scheme
   (WAPS), one of the critical WAPAC applications, and evaluate the
   proposed NIDS and IMPS components of ARS in a cyber-physical testbed
   environment. Our experimental results reveal a promising performance in
   detecting and mitigating different classes of cyberattacks while
   supporting an alert visualization dashboard to provide an accurate
   situational awareness in real-time.},

Title = {Biometric Information Recognition Using Artificial Intelligence
   Algorithms: A Performance Comparison},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {49167-49183},
Abstract = {Addressing crime detection, cyber security and multi-modal gaze
   estimation in biometric information recognition is challenging. Thus,
   trained artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as Support vector
   machine (SVM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have
   been proposed to recognize distinct and discriminant features of
   biometric information (intrinsic hand features and demographic cues)
   with good classification accuracy. Unfortunately, due to nonlinearity in
   distinct and discriminant features of biometric information, accuracy of
   SVM and ANFIS is reduced. As a result, optimized AI algorithms ((ANFIS)
   with subtractive clustering (ANFIS-SC) and SVM with error correction
   output code (SVM-ECOC)) have shown to be effective for biometric
   information recognition. In this paper, we compare the performance of
   the ANFIS-SC and SVM-ECOC algorithms in their effectiveness at learning
   essential characteristics of intrinsic hand features and demographic
   cues based on Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) feature selection.
   Furthermore, the accuracy of these algorithms are presented, and their
   recognition performances are evaluated by root mean squared error
   (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), scatter index (SI), mean
   absolute deviation (MAD), coefficient of determination (R-2), Akaike's
   Information Criterion (AICc) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency index
   (NSE). Evaluation results show that both SVM-ECOC and ANFIS-SC
   algorithms are suitable for accurately recognizing soft biometric
   information on basis of intrinsic hand measurements and demographic
   cues. Moreover, comparison results demonstrated that ANFIS-SC algorithms
   can provide better recognition accuracy, with RMSE, AICc, MAPE, R-2 and
   NSE values of <= 3.85, 2.39E C02, 0.18\%, >= 0.99 and >= 99,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {This article presents a framework to control interactive and
   teleoperative systems on the web. Strategies inherited from the space
   conquest are available for teleoperation. Unfortunately they are not
   immediately usable due to new elements not present in the space
   teleoperation : Internet and the presence of many users. A teleoperation
   system is a communication kernel for the dialog between a client, a
   server and an interface towards an automated system. This interface
   depends on the automated system and the management of the communication
   quality. The interactions between the communication events and the
   automated system operating modes have to be analyzed, as well as the
   multi-users aspects. These interactions generate the necessary
   constraints to define bow the security of such teleoperation platform
   might be ensured. A graphical representation of the automated system
   evolutions might provide the tool for the secure design of a
   teleoperation architecture. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes an adaptive security transmission scheme based on
   fountain code and channel feedback. The fountain code has such a
   characteristic that as long as the legitimate user correctly collects
   sufficient fountain packets before the malicious user does, information
   leakage can be voided and secure communication can be realized. Inspired
   by this insight, we develop a fountain coding mechanism which
   dynamically adjusts the fountain code construction via the feedback
   channel. Moreover, transmit power control is employed to enhance the
   rate of packet reception of the legitimate receiver. We analyse the
   performance of our scheme in terms of intercept probability and QoS
   violating probability. Numerical simulations verify our theoretical
   analysis results, and demonstrate that the proposed scheme enhances the
   system secrecy and reduces the decoding delay compared with the other
   previous schemes.},

Abstract = {Multi-User MIMO has attracted much attention due to its significant
   advantage of increasing the utilization ratio of wireless channels.
   Recently a serious eavesdropping attack, which exploits the CSI feedback
   of the FDD system, is discovered in MU-MIMO networks. In this paper, we
   firstly show a similar eavesdropping attack for the TDD system is also
   possible by proposing a novel, feasible attack approach. Following it, a
   malicious user can eavesdrop on other users' downloads by transforming
   training sequences. To prevent this attack, we propose a secure CSI
   estimation scheme for instantaneous CSI. Furthermore, we extend this
   scheme to achieve adaptive security when CSI is relatively statistical.
   We have implemented our scheme for both uplink and downlink of MU-MIMO
   and performed a series of experiments. Results show that our secure CSI
   estimation scheme is highly effective in preventing downlink leakage
   against malicious users.},

Title = {A searchable encryption scheme with hidden search pattern and access
   pattern on distributed cloud system},

Abstract = {Dynamic searchable encryption methods allow a client to perform searches
   and updates over encrypted data stored in the cloud. Recent schemes
   enable secure searching over an encrypted database stored in a server,
   but these schemes only focus on hiding the access pattern using ORAM.
   Although the traditional Oblivious Random Access Machine ( ORAM) can
   hide the access pattern, which refers to the set of documents that match
   the client's queries, it also incurs significant communication overhead
   and cannot hide the search pattern. Existing researches show that the
   general dynamic searchable symmetric encryption (DSSE) scheme is
   vulnerable to statistical attacks due to the leakage of both search
   patterns and access patterns. Therefore hiding the access pattern is not
   enough, it is essential to hide both access patterns and search patterns
   with high efficiency. To overcome this limitation, a DSSE scheme called
   obliviously shuffled incidence matrix DSSE (OSM-DSSE) is proposed in
   this paper to access the encrypted data obliviously without using ORAM.
   The OSM- DSSE scheme realizes efficient search and update operations
   based on an incidence matrix. In particular, a shuffling algorithm using
   Paillier encryption combines the 1- out-of-n obliviously transfer (OT)
   protocol to hide access pattern and an optimized padding scheme to
   obfuscate the search pattern with low storage overhead. Besides,
   Simulation results and security analysis confirm that OSMDSSE scheme
   achieves high security and efficient searches. Also, this scheme
   provides adaptive security against malicious attacks by adversaries.
   Furthermore, OSM-DSSE is capable of searching for a keyword out of 9 x
   1010 keyword-file pairs within 2.19 s which is 3-4 x better execution
   efficiency than the state-of-art solutions.},

Abstract = {Configuration changes are a common source of instability in networks,
   leading to outages, performance disruptions, and security
   vulnerabilities. Even when the initial and final configurations are
   correct, the update process itself often steps through intermediate
   configurations that exhibit incorrect behaviors. This paper introduces
   the notion of consistent network updates updates that are guaranteed to
   preserve well-defined behaviors when transitioning between
   configurations. We identify two distinct consistency levels, per-packet
   and per-flow, and we present general mechanisms for implementing them in
   Software-Defined Networks using switch APIs like Open Flow. We develop a
   formal model of Open Flow networks, and prove that consistent updates
   preserve a large class of properties. We describe our prototype
   implementation, including several optimizations that reduce the overhead
   required to perform consistent updates. We present a verification tool
   that leverages consistent updates to significantly reduce the complexity
   of checking the correctness of network control software. Finally, we
   describe the results of some simple experiments demonstrating the
   effectiveness of these optimizations on example applications.},

Title = {Optimization and Minimum-Energy Approaches for Private Message Security
   in the Wavelet Domain of Audio Signals},
Journal = {CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 11},
Abstract = {In the field of embedding digital information or private message into an
   audio signal, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER) are
   commonly performance indexes in measuring the distortion and robustness.
   The larger the value of SNR, the better the audio quality of the
   embedded information, and the smaller the value of BER, the more
   resistant the embedded information is to malicious attacks. This study
   first considers the unknown coefficients in the discrete wavelet
   transform and the unknown weights of these coefficients, as well as the
   state-switching embedded equations in an optimization model to embed
   digital information or private message. Next, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theorem
   and minimum-energy approach play two essential roles to determine the
   unknown coefficients and the unknown weights so as to complete the
   information embedding or private message communication. In addition, the
   extraction of private message is similar to the private message
   embedding reversely. Finally, this study obtains an essential
   optimization-based system with state switching for embedding digital
   information or private message into an audio signal. Experimental
   results verify that the embedded audio in the proposed method has high
   SNR and low BER, indicating strong robustness against various attacks,
   such as re-sampling, amplitude scaling, and mp3 compression.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the frequent accidents, natural disasters, public
   health, social security incidents have caused huge loss throughout the
   whole Country. One of the fundamental causes is that the community-based
   emergency management model not yet formed. Six typical emergency
   management models are selected from different countries and
   international organizations. They are RPRR, APELL, Disaster Resistant
   Community, Disaster Resilient Community, Community Emergency
   Preparedness, and Safe Community. Based on the comparative analysis in
   aspects of operational procedures, distinctive characteristics, primary
   disadvantages, a conceptual model of Community-based Emergency
   Management System (CBEMS) is derived combining with the characteristics
   of China's Situation. This thesis elaborates the theoretical foundation
   for the establishment of CBEMS, and puts forward its key elements and
   operational mode.},

Abstract = {The Internet connects hundreds of millions of computers across the world
   running on multiple hardware and software platforms providing
   communication and commercial services. However, this interconnectivity
   among computers also enables malicious users to misuse resources and
   mount Internet attacks. The continuously growing Internet attacks pose
   severe challenges to develop a flexible, adaptive security oriented
   methods. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of most important
   component being used to detect the Internet attacks. In literature,
   different techniques from various disciplines have been utilized to
   develop efficient IDS. Artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques
   plays prominent role in development of IDS and has many benefits over
   other techniques. However, there is no comprehensive review of AI based
   techniques to examine and understand the current status of these
   techniques to solve the intrusion detection problems. In this paper,
   various AI based techniques have been reviewed focusing on development
   of IDS. Related studies have been compared by their source of audit
   data, processing criteria, technique used, dataset, classifier design,
   feature reduction technique employed and other experimental environment
   setup. Benefits and limitations of AI based techniques have been
   discussed. The paper will help the better understanding of different
   directions in which research has been done in the field of IDS. The
   findings of this paper provide useful insights into literature and are
   beneficial for those who are interested in applications of AI based
   techniques to IDS and related fields. The review also provides the
   future directions of the research in this area.},

Abstract = {Threshold cryptography is a fundamental distributed computational
   paradigm for enhancing the availability and the security of
   cryptographic public-key schemes. It does it by dividing private keys
   into n shares handed out to distinct servers. In threshold signature
   schemes, a set of at least t + 1 <= n servers is needed to produce a
   valid digital signature. Availability is assured by the fact that any
   subset of t + 1 servers can produce a signature when authorized. At the
   same time, the scheme should remain robust (in the fault tolerance
   sense) and unforgeable (cryptographically) against up to t corrupted
   servers; i.e., it adds quorum control to traditional cryptographic
   services and introduces redundancy. Originally, most practical threshold
   signatures have a number of demerits: They have been analyzed in a
   static corruption model (where the set of corrupted servers is fixed at
   the very beginning of the attack), they require interaction, they assume
   a trusted dealer in the key generation phase (so that the system is not
   fully distributed), or they suffer from certain overheads in terms of
   storage (large share sizes). In this paper, we construct practical fully
   distributed (the private key is born distributed), non-interactive
   schemes -where the servers can compute their partial signatures without
   communication with other servers- with adaptive security (i.e., the
   adversary corrupts servers dynamically based on its full view of the
   history of the system). Our schemes are very efficient in terms of
   computation, communication, and scalable storage (with private key
   shares of size O(1), where certain solutions incur O(n) storage costs at
   each server). Unlike other adaptively secure schemes, our schemes are
   erasure-free (reliable erasure is a hard to assure and hard to
   administer property in actual systems). To the best of our knowledge,
   such a fully distributed highly constrained scheme has been an open
   problem in the area. In particular, and of special interest, is the fact
   that Pedersen's traditional distributed key generation (DKG) protocol
   can be safely employed in the initial key generation phase when the
   system is born - although it is well-known not to ensure uniformly
   distributed public keys. An advantage of this is that this protocol only
   takes one round optimistically (in the absence of faulty player).},

Abstract = {The purpose is to solve the problems of high transmission rate and low
   delay in the deployment of mobile edge computing network, ensure the
   security and effectiveness of the Internet of things (IoT), and save
   resources. Dynamic power management is adopted to control the working
   state transition of Edge Data Center (EDC) servers. A load prediction
   model based on long-short term memory (LSTM) is creatively proposed. The
   innovation of the model is to shut down the server in idle state or low
   utilization in EDC, consider user mobility and EDC location information,
   learn the global optimal dynamic timeout threshold strategy and N-policy
   through trial and error reinforcement learning method, reasonably
   control the working state switching of the server, and realize load
   prediction and analysis. The results show that the performance of
   AdaGrad optimization solver is the best when the feature dimension is 3,
   the number of LSTM network layers is 6, the time series length is 30-45,
   the batch size is 128, the training time is 788 s, the number of units
   is 250, and the number of times is 350. Compared with the traditional
   methods, the proposed load prediction model and power management
   mechanism improve the prediction accuracy by 4.21\%. Compared with
   autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) load prediction, the
   dynamic power management method of LSTM load prediction can reduce
   energy consumption by 12.5\% and realize the balance between EDC system
   performance and energy consumption. The system can effectively meet the
   requirements of multi-access edge computing (MEC) for low delay, high
   bandwidth and high reliability, reduce unnecessary energy consumption
   and waste, and reduce the cost of MEC service providers in actual
   operation. This exploration has important reference value for promoting
   the energy-saving development of Internet-related industries.},

Abstract = {The use of dynamic access control policies for threat response adapts
   local response decisions to high level system constraints. However,
   security policies are often carefully tightened during system
   design-time, and the large number of service dependencies in a system
   architecture makes their dynamic adaptation difficult. The enforcement
   of a single response rule requires performing multiple configuration
   changes on multiple services. This paper formally describes a Service
   Dependency Framework (SDF) in order to assist the response process in
   selecting the policy enforcement points (PEPs) capable of applying a
   dynamic response rule. It automatically derives elementary access rules
   from the generic access control, either allowed or denied by the dynamic
   response policy, so they can be locally managed by local PEPs. SDF
   introduces a requires/provides model of service dependencies. It models
   the service architecture in a modular way, and thus provides both
   extensibility and reusability of model components. SDF is defined using
   the Architecture Analysis and Design Language, which provides formal
   concepts for modeling system architect tires. This paper presents a
   systematic treatment of the dependency model which aims to apply policy
   rules while minimizing configuration changes and reducing resource
   consumption.},

Abstract = {TCP stacks provide reliable data transmission in network, and thus they
   should be correctly implemented and well tested to ensure reliability
   and security. However, testing TCP stacks is difficult. First, a TCP
   stack accepts packets and system calls that have dependencies between
   each other, and thus generating effective test cases is challenging.
   Second, a TCP stack has various complex state transitions, but existing
   testing approaches target covering states instead of covering state
   transitions, and thus their testing coverage is limited. Finally, our
   study of TCP stack commits shows that 87\% of bug-fixing commits are
   related to semantic bugs (such as RFC violations), but existing bug
   sanitizers can detect only memory bugs not semantic bugs.
   In this paper, we design a novel fuzzing framework named TCP-Fuzz, to
   effectively test TCP stacks and detect bugs. TCP-Fuzz consists of three
   key techniques: (1) a dependency-based strategy that considers
   dependencies between packets and system calls, to generate effective
   test cases; (2) a transition-guided fuzzing approach that uses a new
   coverage metric named branch transition as program feedback, to improve
   the coverage of state transitions; (3) a differential checker that
   compares the outputs of multiple TCP stacks for the same inputs, to
   detect semantic bugs. We have evaluated TCP-Fuzz on five widely-used TCP
   stacks (TLDK, F-Stack, mTCP, FreeBSD TCP and Linux TCP), and find 56
   real bugs (including 8 memory bugs and 48 semantic bugs). 40 of these
   bugs have been confirmed by related developers.},

   the scientific community in this decade to provide efficient, secure,
   and safe communication in smart cities. Network Simulators are widely
   used for the development of safe and secure communication architectures
   in smart city. Therefore, in this technical survey report, we have
   conducted experimental comparisons among ten different simulation
   environments that can be used to simulate smart-city operations. We
   comprehensively analyze and compare simulators COOJA, NS-2 with
   framework Mannasim, NS-3, OMNeT++ with framework Castalia, WSNet,
   TOSSIM, J-Sim, GloMoSim, SENSE, and Avrora. These simulators have been
   run eight times each and comparison among them is critically
   scrutinized. The main objective behind this research paper is to assist
   developers and researchers in selecting the appropriate simulator
   against the scenario to provide safe and secure wired and wireless
   networks. In addition, we have discussed the supportive simulation
   environments, functions, and operating modes, wireless channel models,
   energy consumption models, physical, MAC, and network-layer protocols in
   detail. The selection of these simulation frameworks is based on
   features, literature, and important characteristics. Lastly, we conclude
   our work by providing a detailed comparison and describing the pros and
   cons of each simulator.},

Abstract = {Modern Power Systems often operate close to their stability limits in
   order to meet the continuously growing demand, due to the difficulties
   in expanding the generation and transmission system. An effective way to
   face power system contingencies that can lead to instability is load
   shedding. In this paper we propose a method to assess the dynamic
   performance of the Greek mainland Power System and to propose a load
   shedding scheme in order to maintain voltage stability under various
   loading conditions and operating states in the presence of critical
   contingencies including outages of one or more generating units in the
   south part of the system. A Self Organizing Map is utilized in order to
   classify the Load profiles of the Power-System. With a decision tree the
   dynamic performance of each class is assessed. The classification of
   Load Profiles by the SOM, provide the load shedding scheme.},

Abstract = {The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a small state transitioning from
   traditional communities into a modern society. This is a complex
   process: it involves instilling a national identity over tribal
   structures; modernising and technologising while retaining Islam;
   ensuring a high level of security while allowing for a liberal and
   relatively free society; preserving culture while building one of the
   largest and most multicultural societies, albeit mostly expatriate; and
   providing one of the safest countries in the Arab world for women. This
   paper presents an expatriate female academic's position in relation to
   the emergent literature on the contradictory positioning of women in
   different Arab cultures. It reviews the literature in the light of
   anecdotal evidence drawn from the author's doctoral students'
   experiences as women leaders within the wider socio-cultural context of
   the UAE and the emergent higher education system that is considered
   central to its nation-building exercise. The discussion recognises the
   implications of different contexts for Emirati women moving into
   leadership positions and calls for further research in the field.},

Title = {Binary feature fusion for discriminative and secure multi-biometric
   cryptosystems},
Journal = {IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {58},
Pages = {254-265},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Biometric cryptosystem has been proven to be a promising approach for
   template protection. Cryptosystems such as fuzzy extractor and fuzzy
   commitment require discriminative and informative binary biometric input
   to offer accurate and secure recognition. In multi-modal biometric
   recognition, binary features can be produced via fusing the real-valued
   unimodal features and binarizing the fused features. However, when the
   extracted features of certain modality are represented in binary and the
   extraction parameters are not known, real-valued features of other
   modalities need to be binarized and the feature fusion needs to be
   carried out at the binary level. In this paper, we propose a binary
   feature fusion method that extracts a set of fused binary features with
   high discriminability (small intra-user and large inter-user variations)
   and entropy (weak dependency among bits and high bit uniformity) from
   multiple sets of binary unimodal features. Unlike existing fusion
   methods that mainly focus on discriminability, the proposed method
   focuses on both feature discriminability and system security: The
   proposed method 1) extracts a set of weakly dependent feature groups
   from the multiple unimodal features; and 2) fuses each group to a bit
   using a mapping that minimizes the intra-user variations and maximizes
   the inter-user variations and uniformity of the fused bit. Experimental
   results on three multi-modal databases show that fused binary feature of
   the proposed method has both higher discriminability and higher entropy
   compared to the unimodal features and the fused features generated from
   the state-of-the-art binary fusion approaches. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel frequency aware robust economic dispatch
   (FARED) approach to exploit the synergistic capability of accommodating
   uncertain loads and renewable generation by accounting for both the
   frequency regulation effect and optimal participation mechanism of
   secondary regulation reserves for conventional units in response to
   uncertainties in the robust optimization counterpart of security
   constrained economic dispatch. The FARED is formulated as a robust
   optimization problem. In this formulation the allowable frequency
   deviation and the possible load or renewable generation curtailments are
   expressed in terms of variable uncertainty sets. The variables in the
   formulation are described as interval variables and treated in affine
   form. In order to improve the computational tractability, the dominant
   constraints which can be the candidates of tight transmission
   constraints are determined by complementarity constraints. Then the
   robust optimization problem is simplified to a bilinear programming
   problem based on duality theory. Finally, the effectiveness and
   efficiency of the proposed method are illustrated based on several study
   cases.},

Abstract = {As the abbreviation for artificial immune system, AIS is an artificial
   intelligence approach newly put forward, which has been widely applied
   to many fields such as data analysis, multi-modal function optimization,
   computer security, error detection, etc. Based on AIS, a novel approach
   was proposed for elevator traffic dynamic zoning with contiguous floors
   during the peak traffic. In this paper, the basic theory of AIS was
   firstly described, then the dynamic zoning model of elevator traffic was
   outlined in detail, and the artificial immune algorithm (AIA) was
   designed for the dynamic zoning model. Comparison was drawn among the
   dynamic zoning based on AIA, static zoning and non-zoning. The
   simulation results demonstrated the feasibility of the approach proposed
   in this paper. Due to its fast convergence, AIA is utilized to quickly
   search the optimal or sub-optimal zoning of elevator traffic, so it is
   adaptive to variable traffic demands.},

Title = {Sensor-based continuous user authentication on smartphone through
   machine learning},
Journal = {MICROPROCESSORS AND MICROSYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {96},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of hardware and software technology, many
   end-users have often stored their data on smartphones through several
   in-built sensors. Thus, the security of stored data on smartphones has
   become a significant concern. This has fueled the importance of
   entry-point authentication methods on smartphones. Many entry-point
   authentication methods have failed to offer security due to insider or
   side-channel attacks. This article introduces a sensor-based continuous
   user authentication approach on the smartphone through multi-modal
   behavioral biometrics and a machine learning model to tackle the
   aforementioned issues. The proposed approach captures the touch and
   motion-based behavioral biometrics through the touchscreen and inertial
   sensors of the device. Then, the proposed approach extracts several
   features from captured behavioral data and selects the best set of
   features through a filter-based feature selection technique. Further, we
   implement a nonlinear support vector machine with optimized
   hyperparameters for training and predicting the features to generate the
   scores. We apply score-level fusion on generated scores of several
   sensors to compute the final score for identification of the genuine
   user. In this article, we systematically evaluate the proposed approach
   with the most commonly used behavioral activities of the smartphone user
   in our daily life. The experiment results on all behavioral activities
   show that the proposed approach obtained the best authentication score
   compared to the other machine learning models, and state-of-the-art
   methods. Finally, we conclude our article by addressing the limitations
   of the proposed approach and practical research issues for future
   exploration.},

Title = {Management and Monitoring of IoT Devices Using Blockchain},

Abstract = {Nowadays, we are surrounded by a large number of IoT (Internet of
   Things) devices and sensors. These devices are designed to make life
   easier and more comfortable. Blockchain technology, especially its mass
   application, is becoming a term number one. Adoption of blockchain into
   enterprise networks still has a few challenges that need to be tackled.
   Utilizing blockchain can bring increased security and efficiency of
   network maintenance. The key feature of the blockchain, immutability,
   brings resistance to unauthorized modifications. The whole history of
   device configuration changes is stored in the blockchain, hence recovery
   after incidents is very straightforward. This paper extends our previous
   studies. We are introducing an improved architecture for management and
   monitoring of IoT devices using a private blockchain. The majority of
   the system is built on a chaincode, which handles CRUD (Create, Read,
   Update, Delete) operations as well as encryption and access control.
   Device configuration files are stored in the blockchain. When a
   modification occurs, the device downloads a new configuration in a
   simple manner. The chaincode receives notification whether setup was
   successful and this history is available for administrators. Our results
   show that such a system is possible and dissemination of configuration
   changes to IoT devices can be secured by the blockchain. The key novelty
   of our solution is a distributed management of configuration files of
   IoT devices in enterprise networks utilizing blockchain technology. This
   is essentially improving security and storage options for configurations
   in the blockchain.},

Abstract = {This study presents a healthcare monitoring architecture coupled with
   wearable sensor systems and an environmental sensor network for
   monitoring elderly or chronic patients in their residence. The wearable
   sensor system, built into a fabric belt, consists of various medical
   sensors that collect a timely set of physiological health indicators
   transmitted via low energy wireless communication to mobile computing
   devices. Three application scenarios are implemented using the proposed
   network architecture. The group-based data collection and data
   transmission using the ad hoc mode promote outpatient healthcare
   services for only one medical staff member assigned to a set of
   patients. Adaptive security issues for data transmission are performed
   based on different wireless capabilities. This study also presents a
   monitoring application prototype for capturing sensor data from wireless
   sensor nodes. The implemented schemes were verified as performing
   efficiently and rapidly in the proposed network architecture.},

Title = {Identity-based outsider anonymous cloud data outsourcing with
   simultaneous individual transmission for IoT environment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {60},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing has
   become an attractive cloud-oriented big data processing paradigm, which
   is playing an important role in efficiency and productivity for
   digitalization of numerous IoT enabled industries. However,
   cloud-assisted IoT is also becoming an increasingly attractive target
   for various cyber-attacks, including the authenticity of outsourcing
   data, untrustworthiness of third parties, and data security and privacy.
   As a potential and promising solution to securely outsource data, we
   present the first construction for an efficient cloud data outsourcing
   system with simultaneous individual transmission preserving outsider
   anonymity of the subscribed consumer set. In our system, a data owner
   generates personalized data for each of the consumers in a group and
   transmits a common encrypted data for the group in such a way that the
   subscribed consumer set is completely hidden from the outsiders.
   Personalized data can be recovered only by an authorized consumer, while
   the common data can be decrypted by all the authorized consumer in that
   group. The communication bandwidth is compact in our construction, and
   the decryption algorithm requires significantly less computation cost.
   We design our scheme using asymmetric bilinear map over the prime order
   group to prevent fault attacks on symmetric bilinear map. Our
   construction is built in identity based setting without any non-standard
   q -type security assumption and does not use random oracles. Our scheme
   enjoys adaptive security against an indistinguishable chosen-plaintext
   attack under the hardness of the standard decisional bilinear
   Diffie-Hellman exponent problem. Furthermore, our design supports an
   exponential number of consumers as the size of the valid identity set
   grows exponentially with the security parameter, whereas it is only
   polynomial in the security parameter for the existing cloud data
   outsourcing systems. In particular, the implementation and performance
   analysis explicates the advantages of our design for
   resource-constrained IoT enabled frameworks.},

Abstract = {Cloud security is a major concern to the current research community.
   Existing solutions are vulnerable to various threats and can easily be
   forged. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals can provide unique
   identification that is being explored by various research groups for the
   development of biometric solutions. In this paper, we present a person
   authentication framework suitable for cloud environment using EEG
   signals. EEG signals are recorded in a mobile device while the
   participants listen to music. Recorded signals are then transferred to a
   cloud server using Representational State Transfer (REST) web service,
   where useful features are extracted. Person identification and
   verification processes are done using two well known classifiers, namely
   Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We have
   improved the performance of the system using a decision fusion approach.
   A total of 40 volunteers have participated in this study for collecting
   brain activity data. Identification accuracy has been recorded as
   97.5\%. Effectiveness of the proposed framework has been validated using
   Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve with 100\% True Positive
   Rate (TPR) and 35\% False Acceptance Rate (FAR).},

Abstract = {Tracking is promising in various applications, such as elderly care and
   security monitoring. Prior works require multiple access points (AP)
   deployed in the tracking region or to utilize elaborately selected
   multipaths in an indoor environment to achieve tracking. However, this
   prevents their wide adoption because scenarios like homes typically only
   have a single AP, and using multipaths is vulnerable to unexpected
   interferences due to the complex indoor environment. This paper proposes
   a tracking system using only a single AP. The insight behind the
   proposed system is to mine the multi-dimensional channel parameters from
   the direct path to realize tracking. Therefore, we develop a model that
   establishes the correlation between the target motion and channel
   parameters, including the direct path's angle of arrival (AoA) and angle
   of departure (AoD). Then, we can formulate the tracking problem as the
   state transition with the observations. Since the nonlinear observation
   equation, we use particle filters to solve the problem accurately.
   Finally, we validate the proposed system via simulation using
   ray-tracing software. The simulation results show that the median
   tracking error is 0.21 m based on a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
   comparable to previous state-of-the-art systems.},

Title = {Detecting Portable Executable Malware by Binary Code Using an Artificial
   Evolutionary Fuzzy LSTM Immune System},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {As the planet watches in shock the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic,
   new forms of sophisticated, versatile, and extremely difficult-to-detect
   malware expose society and especially the global economy. Machine
   learning techniques are posing an increasingly important role in the
   field of malware identification and analysis. However, due to the
   complexity of the problem, the training of intelligent systems proves to
   be insufficient in recognizing advanced cyberthreats. The biggest
   challenge in information systems security using machine learning methods
   is to understand the polymorphism and metamorphism mechanisms used by
   malware developers and how to effectively address them. This work
   presents an innovative Artificial Evolutionary Fuzzy LSTM Immune System
   which, by using a heuristic machine learning method that combines
   evolutionary intelligence, Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and fuzzy
   knowledge, proves to be able to adequately protect modern information
   system from Portable Executable Malware. The main innovation in the
   technical implementation of the proposed approach is the fact that the
   machine learning system can only be trained from raw bytes of an
   executable file to determine if the file is malicious. The performance
   of the proposed system was tested on a sophisticated dataset of high
   complexity, which emerged after extensive research on PE malware that
   offered us a realistic representation of their operating states. The
   high accuracy of the developed model significantly supports the validity
   of the proposed method. The final evaluation was carried out with
   in-depth comparisons to corresponding machine learning algorithms and it
   has revealed the superiority of the proposed immune system.},

Abstract = {With the rapidly growing use of biometric authentication systems, the
   security of these systems and the privacy of users have attracted
   significant attention in recent years. Multi-modal biometrics have been
   able to improve the accuracy of the system but require additional
   bandwidth to exchange the data. Fragile watermarking has been used to
   allow the transmission of both biometric templates using the amount of
   data required to transmit one of them, that is, the cover image, while
   securing these templates against attacks. Despite the high accuracy of
   these systems, communicating such templates imposes risks towards the
   privacy of the users. In this study, a new method is proposed to
   generate fixed-size descriptors for the face and fingerprint templates,
   including the timestamp of the transmission and a unique system
   identifier. The inclusion of the timestamp enables the system to detect
   and deny replay attacks, while the unique system identifier maintains
   the privacy of the users. The experiments conducted to evaluate the
   proposed method have shown that the proposed method has been able to
   achieve these features while maintaining high recognition rates, 99.41\%
   and 99.32\%, similar to the use of the entire biometric templates in the
   matching stage.},

Title = {Deriving adaptive long-term complementary operating rules for a
   large-scale hydro-photovoltaic hybrid power plant using ensemble Kalman

Abstract = {The complementary operating rules of hydro-photovoltaic (PV) hybrid
   power plants have been explored fully to operate reservoirs for
   complementing the PV output. However, prevailing operating rules were
   constant, which is incapable to be dynamically updated based on new
   observations. To address this issue, adaptive complementary operating
   rules were developed to deal with the future uncertainties of reservoir
   inflow and solar radiation using ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). First, a
   long-term complementary optimization model was developed to derive the
   initial parameters of linear operating rules. Then, the optimal
   decisions under historical condition were used as the observation.
   Finally, six assimilation schemes were proposed, according to the two
   state transition equations (the same period of the previous year, the
   previous period) and three observations (the same period of the previous
   year, the previous period and their joint). China's Longyangxia hydro-PV
   hybrid power plant was chosen as a case study. Results show that (1) the
   two state transition equations have comparative effects on operation
   results, (2) the choice of observation plays a decisive role. The
   assimilation scheme, in which the optimal operation decision of the same
   period in previous year is as observation, outperforms the stationary
   operating rules. Specifically, the total power generation and guaranteed
   rate are improved by 7.14\% and 5.33\%, respectively, (3) the deriving
   framework works effectively under the synthetic nonstationary reservoir
   inflow and solar radiation, and ensures the stability and security of
   energy system in the changing environment.},

Title = {Toward adaptive decision support for assessing infrastructure system
   resilience using hidden performance measures},

Number = {8},
Pages = {1020-1043},

Abstract = {The understanding of resilience is an emerging topic within the study of
   risks affecting distributed infrastructure systems. Although recent
   studies have explored the quantification of system resilience, there has
   been limited research aimed at understanding the role of multiple
   performance measures, spatiotemporal heterogeneities, and modeling
   uncertainties within the assessment of resilience and associated
   decision-making. Under real-world conditions, there is an increased
   burden on analysts for translating observed system data (including human
   and electronic sensor observations) into system performance estimates
   that may not be directly observable. This paper addresses these issues
   using a scenario-based risk modeling approach to understand: (1)
   resilience of complex systems, often in cases of hidden (not readily
   observable) measures of performance, (2) resilience sensitivity to
   modeling uncertainties in event and system characteristics, and (3)
   resilience sensitivity to the measurement of performance across multiple
   operational perspectives. The methods in this paper integrate
   uncertainty-driven risk and probabilistic modeling within a multi-state
   Markov-based approach. This study contributes to the state-of-the-art by
   developing methodologies for assessing community perceptions of
   infrastructure system resilience using observable factors and inferring
   possibly hidden performance measures for facilitating adaptive
   decision-support. The methods are demonstrated with hypothetical
   spatiotemporal data across multiple system performance dimensions. The
   analysis results are useful for infrastructure security analysts, system
   decision-makers, and the general public.},

Abstract = {The ever increasing demand of security has resulted in a wide use of
   Biometrics systems. Despite overcoming the traditional verification
   problems, the unimodal systems suffer from various challenges like intra
   class variation, noise in the sensor data etc, affecting the system
   performance. These problems are effectively handled by the multimodal
   systems. In this paper, we present a multimodal approach for palm and
   finger prints by decision level fusion. The proposed multi-modal system
   is tested on a developed database consisting of 440 palm and finger
   prints each of 55 individuals. In methodology of decision level fusion,
   Directional energy based feature vectors of palm and finger print
   identifiers are compared with their respective databases to generate
   scores based upon which final decisions are made by the individual
   matcher which are combined through Bayesian decision fusion. Receiver
   Operating Characteristics curves are formed for the unimodal and
   multimodal systems. Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.7321\% for decision
   level fusion shows that the multimodal systems significantly
   outperforms. unimodal palm and finger prints identifiers with EER of
   2.822\% and 2.553\% respectively.},

Abstract = {Broadcast encryption is an efficient way to send the broadcast messages,
   but, it does not yield a productive way to send the personalized
   messages to individuals. A broadcast encryption with personalized
   messages (BEPM) skillfully sends the broadcast message to a group of
   users together with the personalized messages to individual users. This
   article identifies constructional flaws in the BEPM scheme of Xu et al.
   and designs three BEPM constructions, namely, BEPM-I, BEPM-II and
   BEPM-III. BEPM-I, BEPM-III are selectively secure. Unlike the existing
   similar works, these schemes eliminate the need of storing public key
   and secret key for transmitting personalized messages. We emphasize that
   BEPM-III employs multilinear maps and achieves logarithmic size public
   parameter with increasing computation cost. More positively, BEPM-II
   achieves adaptive security with the parameter size and computation cost
   as in the existing BEPM. All our constructions have constant
   communication cost and proven to be secure in the standard security
   model under reasonable assumptions in generic group model. Furthermore,
   our schemes are fully collision resistant and flexible for adding and
   removing of users from the broadcast system.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a new philosophy on protection systems in bulk
   electric power systems. Traditional protection systems are non-adaptive
   and have been usually applied with bias towards dependability, one of
   the two considerations on designing electric grid protection systems
   (the other one is security). The art and science of protection and
   control of tomorrow drives the power system professionals to design and
   implement schemes that are adaptive and aim towards security. It is
   important to minimize system exposures when the power system is in a
   stressed state or in early stages of a sequence of events to halt or
   mitigate disturbance propagation. One of the leading contributions to
   the future of grid protection would be to avoid incorrect tripping of
   unaffected equipment therefore maintaining the power system integrity.
   In addition, with the ever-increasing load demand and the advent of the
   deregulated power market recently, power systems are pushed more often
   to operate close to design limits and with more uncertainty of the
   system operating mode. The proposed protection systems offer adaptive
   concepts by adjusting the need for more dependability or security as
   applicable, through the application of fuzzy logic and based on a set of
   real-time factors, such as system state index, nodal price, and
   equipment outage impact index. Results from our work can be used as a
   roadmap for further enhancement leading to the introduction of
   algorithms in commercial products.},

Title = {A Planning Framework for Optimal Partitioning of Distribution Networks
   Into Microgrids},
Journal = {IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel methodology for the optimal design of
   microgrids in distribution systems with multiple distributed generation
   units (DGs). Following the IEEE Standard 1547.4-2011, the operation and
   control of large distribution networks can be enhanced by dividing these
   networks into multiple virtual microgrids. The proposed planning
   framework incorporates the necessary conditions for microgrids to
   operate efficiently in grid-connected operating mode and successfully
   during islanding. To obtain a robust design, the clustering process
   considers three objectives: maximizing the self-adequacy of the designed
   microgrids, maximizing microgrid islanding success probability, and a
   combination of both targets. For this purpose, the PG\&E distribution
   system with 69 buses is selected as a test case. Backtracking search
   optimization algorithm, a probabilistic load flow approach, and
   graph-based theories are used to accomplish this research. Simulation
   results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining the self-adequacy and
   the islanding success probability objectives in the clustering process.
   Compared with other strategies present in the previous literature, the
   proposed framework results in more self-sufficient and successful
   islands assessed in terms of active and reactive power adequacy as well
   as voltage constraints. Next, the effects of increased penetration level
   of DGs and installation of both distributed energy-storage units and
   distributed reactive sources on the design process are examined.
   Finally, a comparison with other microgrid design objectives applied in
   previous researches reveals that the resultant design is sensitive to
   the system's reliability, security, and economic requirements.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a low-cost approach that allows distributed
   control/command architectures to be used for industrial systems. The
   goal of this project is to be able to run the systems thanks to
   simulation software, which can be replaced by the real parts as soon as
   they are built. This generic software can be used in the simulation and
   evaluation mode and also in the final operational mode.
   Our approach can be summarized by the following three key points:
   A distributed architecture of smart sensors and actuators, which are
   binded by a dedicated data network (CAN fieldbus).
   An embedded version of Linux, which acts as an an ethernet gateway is
   developed and allows the supervision of a remote control points.
   The connections of new elements are simplified thanks to a
   classification of sensors and actuators.
   When new machine or systems are developed with requirements such as
   flexibility and real time constraints we chose an open architecture
   divided in two stages to ensure optimal data transmission security. ne
   low-level activity is ensured by a priority-based fieldbus to connect
   hardware devices through low cost micro-controllers. The second level
   interface collects data flow and transfers control from the ethernet
   supervisor. This interface runs on an embedded PC under Linux operating
   system (OS). With such an open OS, a very compact and evaluative code
   has been produced.
   A first demonstration model was developed in collaboration with the
   astrophysical Labs and Observatory of Grenoble. This model has allowed a
   validation of the proposed architecture for an experimental
   astrophysical instrument. It is noteworthy that such an architecture can
   be used in other systems such as those used in the area of digital
   printing.},

Title = {Evaluation for Risk of Cascading Failures in Power Grids by
   Inverse-Community Structure},

Abstract = {Recently, the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) enables more
   comprehensive and intelligent analysis and defense for cascading
   failures in power grids. This article summarizes power grids as temporal
   weighted networks (TWNs) which are different from conventional temporal
   networks. For TWN, the topological structure is fixed but weight
   distribution is time varying. Then it is noted that for different
   operating states represented by different weight (power flow)
   distribution at different time sections, the risks of cascading failures
   would be completely different. Inspired by the analysis of
   intersubnetworks power shifts in cascading failures, inverse-community
   (IC) structure is proposed in TWN to intuitively identify the risk of
   cascading failures. IC describes a structure in weighted networks with
   several communities in which the weighted interaction between
   communities is significantly stronger than that within the same
   community. Furthermore, the conventional modularity is upgraded as
   inverse-modularity (IM) to quantify the characteristic of IC structure
   in power networks. Subsequently, considering the risk of cascading
   failures represented by IM and the cost of power network operation, a
   security/economic dispatch (SED) method is designed to handle the
   optimal power dispatch issues. Simulation results prove a positive
   correlation between IM of power flow distribution and risk of cascading
   failures. Furthermore, the results on the IEEE 118-bus system
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SED method in mitigating
   cascading failure risks.},

Abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence capabilities into modern
   software systems is increasingly being simplified through the use of
   cloud-based machine learning services and representational state
   transfer architecture design. However, insufficient information
   regarding underlying model provenance and the lack of control over model
   evolution serve as an impediment to more widespread adoption of these
   services in operational environments which have strict security
   requirements. Furthermore, although tools such as TensorFlow Serving
   allow models to be deployed as RESTful endpoints, they require the
   error-prone process of converting the PyTorch models into static
   computational graphs needed by TensorFlow. To enable rapid deployments
   of PyTorch models without the need for intermediate transformations, we
   have developed FlexServe, a simple library to deploy multi-model
   ensembles with flexible batching.},

Title = {An Integrated Energy System Operating Scenarios Generator Based on
   Generative Adversarial Network},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The convergence of energy security and environmental protection has
   given birth to the development of integrated energy systems (IES).
   However, the different physical characteristics and complex coupling of
   different energy sources have deeply troubled researchers. With the
   rapid development of AI and big data, some attempts to apply data-driven
   methods to IES have been made. Data-driven technologies aim to abandon
   complex IES modeling, instead mining the mapping relationships between
   different parameters based on massive volumes of operating data.
   However, integrated energy system construction is still in the initial
   stage of development and operational data are difficult to obtain, or
   the operational scenarios contained in the data are not enough to
   support data-driven technologies. In this paper, we first propose an IES
   operating scenario generator, based on a Generative Adversarial Network
   (GAN), to produce high quality IES operational data, including energy
   price, load, and generator output. We estimate the quality of the
   generated data, in both visual and quantitative aspects. Secondly, we
   propose a control strategy based on the Q-learning algorithm for a
   renewable energy and storage system with high uncertainty. The agent can
   accurately map between the control strategy and the operating states.
   Furthermore, we use the original data set and the expanded data set to
   train an agent; the latter works better, confirming that the generated
   data complements the original data set and enriches the running
   scenarios.},

Abstract = {Speech signals carry valuable information about the speaker including
   age, gender, and emotional state. Gender information can act as a vital
   preprocessing ingredient for enhancing speech analysis applications like
   adaptive human machine interfaces, multi-modal security applications,
   and sophisticated intent and context analysis based forensic systems. In
   uncontrolled environments like telephone speech applications, the gender
   recognition system should be adaptive, accurate, and robust to noisy
   environments. This paper presents a reasoning method governed by
   Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence for automatic gender recognition from
   telephone speech. The proposed method uses mel-frequency cepstral
   coefficients with a support vector machine to generate the initial
   prediction results for individual speech segments. The reasoning scheme
   collects and validates results from support vector machine and treats
   convincing predictions as valid evidence. It is argued that the
   consideration of valid evidence in the reasoning process improves
   recognition performance by avoiding unconvincing classification results.
   Experiments conducted on large speech datasets reveal the superiority of
   the proposed gender recognition scheme for speech analysis applications.},

Title = {Data security of machine learning applied in low-carbon smart grid: A
   formal model for the physics-constrained robustness},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {347},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Towards the low-carbon goal, a smart grid features remote connection,
   data sharing, and cyber-physical integration to increase the flexibility
   of energy supplies, to reduce electricity wastage, and to enhance safety
   under intermittent renewables. In this context, machine learning (ML) is
   increasingly employed in smart grids to solve tasks that require deep
   data analytics. However, it is well recognized that ML models are
   vulnerable to adversarial examples that might be contained in open
   shared data, which creates opportunities for potential attackers to
   launch cyberattacks. In particular, system operating states acting as
   critical inputs to ML-based smart grid applications (MLsgAPPs) can be
   manipulated by malicious actors to mislead the system operator into
   making wrong decisions that in turn may cause major blackouts and other
   damaging cascading events. It is thus imperative to advance
   vulnerability assessment for MLsgAPPs.In this paper, we propose a
   physics-constrained robustness evaluation framework for MLsgAPPs, which
   is a first attempt of using tree ensemble (TE) models. Unlike
   adversarial attacks against prior studied image classification tasks,
   adversarial examples against TE-based smart grid applications (TEsgAPPs)
   must not only cheat human intuition but also follow laws of physics and
   bypass error-checking mechanisms for power systems. Thus, formulation of
   the traditional robustness evaluation problem must be reconsidered to
   account for domain-specific misclassification, physical limit, power
   balance, and error-bypass constraints, in order to obtain tight lower
   bounds of the magnitudes of tolerated adversarial perturbations. We
   adopt a formal modeling approach to construct a discrete tree structure
   and to specify the model evasion conditions. We propose an efficient
   robustness evaluation method by transforming variables considering
   \&\#xfffd;\&\#xfffd;\&\#xfffd;\&\#xfffd;\&\#xfffd;\&\#xfffd;1 and
   \&\#xfffd;\&\#xfffd;\&\#xfffd;\&\#xfffd;\&\#xfffd;\&\#xfffd;\& INFIN;
   norms, followed by a generalization that expands the variable space to
   admit other types of norms. Using TE-based power system security
   assessment as an example, comprehensive simulations are conducted for
   evaluating the physics-constrained robustness under different TE models
   and model parameters.},

Abstract = {Most of the existing risk assessment methods are generally limited to
   external factors and ignore internal factors. Here we introduce a
   real-time method to network risk assessment that takes both external and
   internal factors into consideration. First, we apply intrusion detection
   system and configuration verification system to detect external and
   internal threats respectively. Then, to speculate system changes, a
   matrix that combines external and internal threats is added to hidden
   Markov models. Finally, new state transition probability matrices are
   automatically generated based on the changes, which remedies the
   deficiency of static transition matrix in the original models.
   Experimental results show that the improved algorithm can improve the
   accuracy and reliability of assessment results.},

Abstract = {Circular statistics present a new technique to analyse the time patterns
   of events in the field of cyber security. We apply this technique to
   analyse incidents of malware infections detected by network monitoring.
   In particular we are interested in the daily and weekly variations of
   these events.
   Based on ``live{''} data provided by Spamhaus, we examine the hypothesis
   that attacks on four countries are distributed uniformly over 24 hours.
   Specifically, we use Rayleigh and Watson tests. While our results are
   mainly exploratory, we are able to demonstrate that the attacks are not
   uniformly distributed, nor do they follow a Poisson distribution as
   reported in other research. Our objective in this is to identify a
   distribution that can be used to establish risk metrics.
   Moreover, our approach provides a visual overview of the time patterns'
   variation, indicating when attacks are most likely. This will assist
   decision makers in cyber security to allocate resources or estimate the
   cost of system monitoring during high risk periods.
   Our results also reveal that the time patterns are influenced by the
   total number of attacks. Networks subject to a large volume of attacks
   exhibit bimodality while one case, where attacks were at relatively
   lower rate, showed a multi-modal daily variation.},

Abstract = {The landside arrival experience of passengers begins on the approaching
   highways and transitions to a variety of other modes such as shuttle
   buses and walking. Probe data from mobile phones provides an important
   data source for collecting system performance data that can be used as
   feedback to improve the management of the various transportation and
   queuing systems used by airport travelers.
   This paper reports on a study using Bluetooth sensors to quantitatively
   evaluate the operations of airport security checkpoints. Bluetooth
   sensors were deployed at George Bush Intercontinental Airport from 30
   August to 13 September, 2010 and collected over 100,000 travel time
   records between data collection stations located along access roads,
   parking garages, non-sterile areas of terminals, and sterile areas of
   terminals. In addition, hourly checkpoint passenger volumes were
   collected. The large volume of this data necessitated the development of
   statistical characterization procedures and graphics that characterize
   both the travel time records and checkpoint information. These
   checkpoint operations reports provide dashboard level reports useful for
   management to rapidly assess operations, and identify opportunities for
   improved allocation of staffing. The paper concludes by providing
   examples of how the checkpoint operations report concept can be extended
   to characterize the movement of traffic through the airport, the entire
   passenger arrival experience, and numerically characterize user delay in
   person-hours. A final overview procedure using pareto sorting to
   identify correctable periods where airports have opportunity to improve
   their utilization is shown.},

   shuffling enabled compressive sensing},
Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {117},
Pages = {36-45},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Cloud-assisted image services are widely used for various applications.
   Due to the high computational complexity of existing image encryption
   techniques, privacy protection becomes extremely challenging for
   resource constrained smart devices. We propose eCIS, a cloud-assisted
   image service where compression and encryption are jointly used for
   image processing efficiency. eCIS could shift the high computational
   cost from encoder and decoder to the cloud while providing efficient and
   adaptive image privacy protection for end users. The key idea is to
   leverage different measurement matrices for sampling device and cloud.
   Thus encryption is realized with shuffling enabled compressive sensing.
   We conduct in-depth theoretical analysis and demonstrate the
   effectiveness with evaluations. To this end, extensive experimental
   results show that eCIS can effectively protect image privacy and meet
   user's adaptive security requirements. Meanwhile, our experimental
   results show that eCIS could significantly save the system running time
   compared with existing cloud-assisted schemes.},

Title = {Born and raised distributively: Fully distributed non-interactive
   adaptively-secure threshold signatures with short shares},
Journal = {THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {645},
Pages = {1-24},
Month = {SEP 13},
Abstract = {Threshold cryptography is a fundamental distributed computational
   paradigm for enhancing the availability and the security of
   cryptographic public-key schemes. It does it by dividing private keys
   into n shares handed out to distinct servers. In threshold signature
   schemes, a set of at least t + 1 <= n servers is needed to produce a
   valid digital signature. Availability is assured by the fact that any
   subset of t + 1 servers can produce a signature when authorized. At the
   same time, the scheme should remain robust (in the fault tolerance
   sense) and unforgeable (cryptographically) against up to t corrupted
   servers; i.e., it adds quorum control to traditional cryptographic
   services and introduces redundancy. Originally, most practical threshold
   signatures have a number of demerits: They have been analyzed in a
   static corruption model (where the set of corrupted servers is fixed at
   the very beginning of the attack); they require interaction; they assume
   a trusted dealer in the key generation phase (so that the system is not
   fully distributed); or they suffer from certain overheads in terms of
   storage (large share sizes).
   In this paper, we construct practical fully distributed (the private key
   is born distributed), non-interactive schemes where the servers can
   compute their partial signatures without communication with other
   servers with adaptive security (i.e., the adversary corrupts servers
   dynamically based on its full view of the history of the system). Our
   schemes are very efficient in terms of computation, communication, and
   scalable storage (with private key shares of size 0(1), where certain
   solutions incur 0(n) storage costs at each server). Unlike other
   adaptively secure schemes, our schemes are erasure-free (reliable
   erasure is hard to assure and hard to administer properly in actual
   systems). To the best of our knowledge, such a fully distributed highly
   constrained scheme has been an open problem in the area. In particular,
   and of special interest, is the fact that Pedersen's traditional
   distributed key generation (DKG) protocol can be safely employed in the
   initial key generation phase when the system is born although it is
   well-known not to ensure uniformly distributed public keys. An advantage
   of this is that this protocol only takes one round optimistically (in
   the absence of faulty player). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Public key broadcast encryption system is a fundamental cryptographic
   primitive that enables a broadcaster to transmit encrypted content to a
   set of users allowing only a privileged subset of users to decrypt the
   content. Traditionally, it is not possible to remove any receiver from
   the encrypted content without decryption. Recipient revocable broadcast
   encryption (RRBE) is an useful cryptographic primitive whereby a trusted
   third party can revoke a set of users from the encrypted content without
   having the ability to decrypt it. This property is not achievable in
   traditional broadcast encryption (BE) schemes. However, the currently
   existing RRBE schemes are secure only in the random oracle model. In
   this paper, we propose two new constructions for RRBE with constant
   number of pairing, linear exponentiation operations and analyze their
   security in the standard model. Our first construction achieves adaptive
   security in the standard model with constant communication cost as
   opposed to the existing adaptively secure RRBE schemes all of which use
   random oracles and have linear communication cost. The storage and
   computation complexity are linear to the total number of users and the
   number of subscribed users respectively.
   Our second construction attains selective security in the standard model
   with constant size public parameter and secret key. The communication
   and computation overhead are linear to the number of revoked users. We
   emphasize that, this scheme is flexible in a sense that constant size
   public parameter allows to encrypt any number of users in the system.
   The proposed constructions are highly comparable with the existing
   similar schemes, exhibits better performance over them and practically
   more efficient.},

Abstract = {In asymmetric information zero-sum games, one player has superior
   information about the game over the other. Asymmetric information games
   are particularly relevant for security problems, e.g., where an attacker
   knows its own skill set or alternatively a system administrator knows
   the state of its resources. In such settings, the informed player is
   faced with the tradeoff of exploiting its superior information at the
   cost of revealing its superior information. This tradeoff is typically
   addressed through randomization, in an effort to keep the uninformed
   player informationally off balance. A lingering issue is the explicit
   computation of such strategies. This paper, building on prior work for
   repeated games, presents an LP formulation to compute suboptimal
   strategies for the informed player in discounted asymmetric information
   stochastic games in which state transitions are not affected by the
   uninformed player. Furthermore, the paper presents bounds between the
   security level guaranteed by the sub-optimal strategy and the optimal
   value. The results are illustrated on a stochastic intrusion detection
   problem.},

Abstract = {Objective: This research aims to build an effective and automated RPM
   system based on an information communication technology (ICT) framework
   that automatically triggers medical alerts, hospital visits,
   medications, and social support in a timely and precise manner, with
   specific attention to aging people. The goal of the proposed framework
   is to construct a safe, flexible, and manageable system containing
   multi-agent, auto-notice, sensor management, and secure transmission of
   data to allow an autonomous functioning of RPM.
   Methods: The literature between 2002 and 2018 that introduces healthcare
   platforms with the technology of the Internet of things (IoT) is
   reviewed and compared in compliance with various technical and
   functional features. Eleven healthcare-based IoT platforms are compared.
   Eight of them utilize the Representational State Transfer Application
   Programming Interface (REST API), while ten of them have Message Queue
   Telemetry Transport (MQTT), seven of them have device management, and
   nine of them have security control. In addition, Kepware's KEPServerEX
   communication platform containing up to 250 communication protocols is
   included.
   Results: The results confirm that the proposed framework reliably
   operates within the complex healthcare processes, taking into account
   the equipment management, security management, messaging and
   diversification of communication protocols. This study uses the concept
   of IoT 3-tier through which a complete sensor management mechanism is
   structured. Moreover, secure data connection protects the patient's
   privacy. Each sensor provides a distinctive notification to construct
   flawless authority management.
   Conclusions: The proposed framework can not only reach the
   machine-to-machine (M2M) realm, but also provide support in emergency
   cases. (C) 2019 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine. Published by

Abstract = {Existing model checking tools for security protocols analysis have two
   drawbacks, when applied to present day cloud-based protocols. Firstly,
   they do not consider the new features of cloud computing. Secondly, they
   do not support the reconstruction of potential attack scenarios. Which
   could provide conclusive descriptions and non refutable proofs regarding
   the source of the attack, details of steps involved in the occurred
   attack scenario, exploited vulnerabilities, and generated system
   damages. In this paper, we use TLA+, a model checking tool of a
   state-based logic that allows the description of states and state
   transitions, to generate executable attack scenarios showing with
   details how the attack scenario was conducted and how the system behaved
   accordingly. Through the analysis of using OpenID protocol in cloud
   environment, we found a new attack scenario.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a new fault location technique based on the
   fundamental frequency positive sequence fault components, featuring
   robustness to the operating state of the prefault system and fault path
   resistance. Using the fundamental frequency positive sequence fault
   components, the technique described in this paper does not require the
   user to know the fault phases and fault type in advance or use a line
   zero sequence parameter, which is not only difficult to obtain but is
   also affected by soil resistivity and thus may be variable. In addition,
   based on the fault components protection principle, the method is
   inherently unaffected by the operating state of the prefault system.
   Accurate transmission lines' fault location is important for expediting
   their repair or reducing outage times, so the proposed technique could
   improve the quality and security of the electricity supply. This paper
   describes the characteristics of the proposed technique and assesses its
   performance by using the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation. (c) 2020 Institute of

Abstract = {As the ultra high frequency (UHF) passive radio frequency identification
   (RFID) technology becomes increasingly deployed, it faces an array of
   new security attacks. In this paper, we consider a type of attack in
   which a malicious RFID reader could arbitrarily access the tags, e.g.,
   retrieve or modify IDs or other data in the memory, via standard
   commands. To deal with this type of attack, we propose a physical-layer
   tag protection framework, namely Arbitrator2.0, that involves two
   operating mode, i.e., one is to passively listen on RF channels and
   identify unauthorized readers, the other is working as normal reader to
   access tag information but resilient to one-antenna eavesdropper. Our
   solution does not need to modify RFID tags or the underlying
   communication standards. In this study, we have implemented a prototype
   Arbitrator2.0 over the universal software radio peripheral (USRP)
   platform, and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its
   performance. The results show that Arbitrator2.0 can effectively
   diminish the unauthorized access attacks and prevent eavesdropping.},

Abstract = {In the attribute-based encryption (ABE) systems, users can encrypt and
   decrypt messages based on their attributes. Because of the flexibility
   of ABE, it is more and more widely used in various network environments.
   However, complex functionality of ABE may cause an enormous
   computational cost. This reason greatly restricts the application of ABE
   in practice. In order to minimize the local computation of ABE, we
   introduce the concept of verifiable outsourced ABE system, in which key
   generation center, encryptor and decryptor, are able to outsource their
   computing tasks to the corresponding service providers, respectively, to
   reduce the local load. In addition, they are also able to verify the
   correctness of outsourcing calculation efficiently by using the
   outsourcing verification services. This is useful to save local
   computational resources, especially for mobile devices. Then, we propose
   a specific verifiable outsourced ABE scheme and prove its adaptive
   security in the standard model using the dual-system encryption method.
   Finally, we introduce how to deploy our outsourced CP-ABE scheme in
   cloud computing environment.},

Title = {Management and coordination of LTC, SVR, shunt capacitor and energy
   storage with high PV penetration in power distribution system for
   voltage regulation and power loss minimization},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {100},

Abstract = {The optimal coordination of load tap changers (LTCs), step voltage
   regulators (SVRs), switched shunt capacitors (SCs) and energy storages
   (ESs) with high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) energy sources for
   simultaneously minimizing energy loss and improving voltage profile are
   performed using genetic algorithm (GA). The GA is developed to find out
   the optimal settings of the LTCs, SVRs and SCs, including the dispatch
   of energy storages. The influence of the PV penetration level on voltage
   profile and tap movement is to be analyzed. Five scenarios are involved
   in this case study. In the first scenario, regulator devices are
   disabled and voltage profile is monitored and recorded. When the LTC is
   enabled in the second scenario, the voltage profile is propped up yet
   still below the voltage limits. The voltage is regulated within the
   limits, when the SVRs are enabled in the third scenario. In the fourth
   scenario, switching `on' the capacitor banks increases the voltage
   profile. This maintains the distribution system security as the voltage
   profile gets flattened off. Finally, the integration of the ES warrants
   voltage profile improvement, particularly when the voltage is low at
   night. The voltage deviation is substantially lowered as well from a
   0.063 pu without the ES to a 0.018 pu with the ES. The proposed method
   is applied to the IEEE 123 test feeder, using time series analysis over
   a diurnal 24-h simulation period. Test results clearly show that the
   close coordination among the VAR control devices and energy storage
   scales back system energy losses and upholds voltage at customer
   terminals within statutory limits, under high penetration levels of
   solar-fueled generation. Comparison between proposed method with
   evolutionary algorithm (EA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are
   investigated that shows the proposed algorithm has better results than
   the other approaches.},

Abstract = {Encryption materials represent a major direction of information
   security, but it is challenging to realize the ideal security combining
   the complete hiding of complex coding, stability in transmission,
   camouflage, and reliable decoding. Herein, we report an innovative
   strategy for rationally constructing encryption composite materials with
   high security and portability. Compared with common colloidal photonic
   watermarks, our encrypted optical devices are composed of thermoplastic
   polyurethanes (TPU) protective layers, polystyrene (PS) switching layers
   and a CdS coding layer. The optical shielding properties and phase state
   transition of PS layers enable high-level encoding and decoding security
   through thermal activation of light transmittance control. Meanwhile,
   the CdS layer can be clearly revealed in decoding mode because of the
   high refractive index. Besides, the confinement protection of integrated
   TPU films prevents the trilayer quasi-amorphous heterostructure from
   damage. To establish the practical advantage, portable information
   carriers can be prepared for camouflage. Accordingly, the reliable
   encoding and decoding system, and ability to integrate with
   easy-to-carry products, make our composites a potentially high-security
   encryption device for anti-fraud technology.},

Abstract = {Preventing information leakage during system execution is essential for
   a system that manages sensitive information. The prevention can be
   achieved through information flow control. Many information flow control
   models have been developed, in which most are for object-oriented
   systems. In our opinion, the procedural C language is still in used
   heavily. Therefore, an information flow control model for procedural
   languages is helpful. We developed a model that can be used in both
   object-oriented and non-object-oriented systems. This paper proposes the
   model, which offers the following features: (1) controlling both read
   and write access, (2) preventing indirect information leakage, (3)
   detailing the granularity of access control to variables, (4)
   controlling module call through argument sensitivity, (5) allowing
   information declassification, (6) controlling information flows among
   cooperating systems, (7) adapting to dynamic object state change, (8)
   allowing purpose-oriented method invocation, and (9) avoiding improper
   function call for non-OO systems.},

Abstract = {Microgrids consist of multiple distributed generators, which are
   normally integrated via power inverters and can employ various
   sustainable energy resources. Therefore, the microgrid is a new
   promising concept for future power systems with improved energy
   security, reliability, quality of power, and energy efficiency. To this
   end, microgrids should survive during severe power system abnormalities
   so that the sub-areas in the microgrids can be protected all the time.
   This paper focuses on a robust controller design scheme for
   inverter-interfaced distributed generators considering various operating
   modes and loading conditions of microgrids. Especially, during the
   island mode, the voltage and system frequency can easily change due to
   instant power mismatch between distributed generators and loads in the
   microgrid. This paper presents the design procedure of a robust optimal
   controller against exogenous disturbances such as voltage and frequency
   variation in microgrids. L-1 robust control theory is applied to
   optimize the robust controller and a Particle Swarm Optimization
   algorithm is used to solve the optimal problems.},

Abstract = {In cloud computing, computationally weak users are always willing to
   outsource costly computations to a cloud, and at the same time they need
   to check the correctness of the result provided by the cloud. Such
   activities motivate the occurrence of verifiable computation (VC).
   Recently, Parno, Raykova and Vaikuntanathan showed any VC protocol can
   be constructed from an attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme for a
   same class of functions. In this paper, we propose two practical and
   efficient semi-adaptively secure key-policy attribute-based encryption
   (KP-ABE) schemes with constant-size ciphertexts. The semi-adaptive
   security requires that the adversary designates the challenge attribute
   set after it receives public parameters but before it issues any secret
   key query, which is stronger than selective security guarantee.
   Our first construction deals with small universe while the second one
   supports large universe. Both constructions employ the technique
   underlying the prime-order instantiation of nested dual system groups,
   which are based on the d-linear assumption including SXDH and DLIN
   assumptions. In order to evaluate the performance, we implement our ABE
   schemes using Python language in Charm. Compared with previous (KP-ABE)
   schemes with constant-size ciphertexts, our constructions achieve
   shorter ciphertext and secret key sizes, and require low computation
   costs, especially under the SXDH assumption.},

Abstract = {Service systems used for various applications in home automation and
   security require estimating the locations precisely using certain
   sensors. Serving a mobile user automatically by sensing his/her
   locations in an indoor environment is considered as a challenge.
   However, indoor localization cannot be carried out effectively using the
   Global Positioning System (GPS). In recent years, the use of Wireless
   Sensor Networks (WSNs) in locating a mobile object in an indoor
   environment has become popular. Some physical features have also been
   discussed to solve localization in WSNs. In this paper, we inquire into
   received signal strength indication (RSSI)-based solutions and propose a
   new localization scheme called the closer tracking algorithm (CTA) for
   indoor localization. Under the proposed CTA, a mechanism on mode-change
   is designed to switch automatically between the optimal approximately
   closer approach (ACA) and the real-time tracking (RTT) method according
   to pre-tuned thresholds. Furthermore, we design a mechanism to move
   reference nodes dynamically to reduce the uncovered area of the ACA for
   increasing the estimation accuracy. We evaluate the proposed CTA using
   ZigBee CC2431 modules. The experimental results show that the proposed
   CTA can determine the position accurately with an error distance less
   than 0.9 m. At the same time, the CTA scheme has at least 87\% precision
   when the distance is less than 0.9m. The proposed CTA can select an
   adaptive mode properly to improve the localization accuracy with high
   confidence. Moreover, the experimental results also show that the
   accuracy can be improved by the deployment and movement of reference
   nodes.},

Abstract = {Anonymous ABE is a promising primitive for enforcing fine-grained access
   control for the big data as well as preserving privacy of the users in
   Cloud Computing. However, traditional anonymous ABE schemes may not be
   secure in the real word due to the side channel attacks. In addition,
   the existing anonymous ABE schemes are considered in the leak-free
   scenario assuming that secret keys are not leaked to the adversary.
   Thus, it is compelling to study the anonymity of ABE schemes in the
   context of key leakage attacks. Aiming at tackling the challenge above,
   an anonymous CP-ABE scheme against side channel attacks in the
   bounded-leakage model is constructed. As a main technique tool, the dual
   system encryption technique is adopted. The proposed scheme uses LSSS as
   access structures and achieves adaptive security in the standard model.
   In addition, the results in simulation experiments indicate that the
   proposed scheme is efficient and practical.},

Title = {Analysis and optimization of wireless powered untrusted relay system
   with multiple destinations},
Journal = {PHYSICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {42},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this paper, the physical layer security is investigated in a dual-hop
   wireless communication scenario, where an energy-constrained relay not
   only assists the source-to-destination information transmission, but
   also acts as a potential eavesdropper wiretapping the source
   information. We take into account both antenna mode switching and
   destination selection for the amplify and forward relaying network. The
   untrusted relay (UR) is equipped with two antennas, where one antenna
   that maximizes the source-to-relay channel gain will be selected for
   reception and the other one is exploited to forward the processed
   information. Moreover, the Nth best destination is considered as the
   legitimate destination, which aims to achieve a better secrecy rate.
   Specially, in general signal-to-noise ratio regime, a low-complexity
   Gaussian Q-function is introduced to derive the exact closed-form
   expression of ergodic secrecy rate (ESR). In addition, when the UR works
   in a non-linear energy harvesting mode, the achievable secrecy rate
   maximization problem is formulated and solved by an alternative
   optimization method. The simulation results reveal the correctness of
   the theoretical derivation and also proves that much higher secrecy
   performance can be achieved by the proposed scheme than other benchmark
   schemes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Safety class DCS(Distributed Control System) in nuclear power plant is
   characterized by multi-state interaction, complex function and unknown
   fault mechanism, which limits the use of tradition PSA(Probabilistic
   Safety Assessment) method such as event tree and fault free. An improved
   dynamic probabilistic security simulation method is proposed based on
   fuzzy Markov process to quantitative evaluation the risk of Safety class
   DCS in nuclear power plant, which resolved the failure uncertainty
   problem without in-depth understanding of failure mechanism. Firstly,
   the fuzzy fault free reliability evaluation model is established based
   on fuzzy theory and FTA(Fault Tree Analysis), which describes the
   probability and degree of failure with fuzzy number. Then, the fuzzy
   fault tree is transformed into fuzzy Markov chain, this model is
   described mathematically, and the reliability indexes are simulated and
   analyzed with Monte Carlo simulation method, the change of system safety
   performance in long-term operation is obtained. Finally, the
   scientificity and effectiveness is verified by the example of redundant
   analog output module of safety class DCS in nuclear plant.},

Title = {MaskSIMD-lib: on the performance gap of a generic C optimized assembly
   and wide vector extensions for masked software with an Ascon-p test case},

Abstract = {Efficient implementations of software masked designs constitute both an
   important goal and a significant challenge to Side Channel Analysis
   attack (SCA) security. In this paper we discuss the shortfall between
   generic C implementations and optimized (inline-) assembly versions
   while providing a large spectrum of efficient and generic masked
   implementations for any order, and demonstrate cryptographic algorithms
   and masking gadgets with reference to the state of the art. Our main
   goal is to show the prime performance gaps we can expect between
   different implementations and suggest how to harness the underlying
   hardware efficiently, a daunting task for various masking-orders or
   masking algorithm (multiplications, refreshing etc.). This paper focuses
   on implementations targeting wide vector bitsliced designs, such as the
   ISAP algorithm. We explore concrete instances of implementations
   utilizing processors enabled by wide-vector capability extensions of the
   AMD64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA); namely, the SSE2/3/4.1, AVX-2
   and AVX-512 Streaming Single Instruction Multiple Data extensions. These
   extensions mainly enable efficient memory level parallelism and provide
   a gradual reduction in computation-time as a function of the level of
   extension and the hardware support for instruction-level parallelism.
   For the first time we provide a complete open-source repository of such
   gadgets tailored for these extensions, various gadgets types and for all
   orders. We evaluate the disparities between generic high-level language
   masking implementations for optimized (inline-) assembly and
   conventional single execution path data-path architectures such as the
   ARM architecture. We underscore the crucial trade-off between state
   storage in the data-memory as compared to keeping it in the
   register-file (RF). This relates specifically to masked designs, and is
   particularly difficult to resolve because it requires inline-assembly
   manipulations and is not natively supported by compilers. Moreover, as
   the masking order (d) increases and the state gets larger, there must be
   an increase in data memory read/write accesses for state handling since
   the RF is simply not large enough. This requires careful optimization
   which depends to a considerable extent on the underlying algorithm to
   implement. We discuss how full utilization of SSE extensions is not
   always possible; i.e. when d is not a power of two, and pin-point the
   optimal d values and very sub-optimal values of d which aggressively
   under-utilize the hardware. More generally, this paper presents several
   different fully generic masked implementations for any order or multiple
   highly optimized (inline-) assembly instances which are quite generic
   (for a wide spectrum of ISAs and extensions), and provide very specific
   implementations targeting specific extensions. The goal is to promote
   open-source availability, research, improvement and implementations
   relating to SCA security and masked designs. The building blocks and
   methodologies provided here are portable and can be easily adapted to
   other algorithms.},

Abstract = {We are developing a multi-robot science exploration architecture and
   system called the Telesupervised Adaptive Ocean Sensor Fleet (TAOSF).
   TAOSF uses a group of robotic boats (the OASIS platforms) to enable
   in-situ study of ocean surface and sub-surface phenomena. The OASIS
   boats are extended-deployment autonomous ocean surface vehicles, whose
   development is funded separately by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA). The TAOSF architecture provides an integrated
   approach to multi-vehicle coordination and sliding human-vehicle
   autonomy. It allows multiple mobile sensing assets to function in a
   cooperative fashion, and the operating mode of the vessels to range from
   autonomous control to teleoperated control. In this manner, TAOSF
   increases data-gathering effectiveness and science return while reducing
   demands on scientists for tasking, control, and monitoring. It combines
   and extends prior related work done by the authors and their
   institutions. The TAOSF architecture is applicable to other areas where
   multiple sensing assets are needed, including ecological forecasting,
   water management, carbon management, disaster management, coastal
   management, homeland security, and planetary exploration. The first
   field application chosen for TAOSF is the characterization of Harmful
   Algal Blooms (HABs). Several components of the TAOSF system have been
   tested, including the OASIS boats, the communications and control
   interfaces between the various hardware and software subsystems, and an
   airborne sensor validation system. Field tests in support of future HAB
   characterization were performed under controlled conditions, using
   rhodamine dye as a HAB simulant that was dispersed in a pond. In this
   paper, we describe the overall TAOSF architecture and its components,
   discuss the initial tests conducted and outline the next steps.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {148},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The coordinated operation of the transmission system (TS) and connected
   distribution systems (DSs) is momentous for handling the increased
   penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs). This paper presents
   a distributed dispatch framework for the collaborative yet independent
   operations of TS and DSs. Only two kinds of boundary coupling variables,
   active power and reserve capacity, are exchanged to implement the
   sharing of energy and reserve among different systems with the
   information privacy preserved. Then, a distributed robust energy and
   reserve dispatch approach is proposed, wherein the flexible resources in
   different systems are coordinated in the normal and uncertainty cases to
   enhance the overall economic efficiency and reliability. Apart from
   generation resources, air conditioning loads integrated by the
   aggregated virtual energy storage (AVES) model are incorporated. And the
   reserve model of AVES with the state-switch-feasibility constraints is
   developed to fully exploit the flexibility of air conditioning
   resources, which can be compatible with the optimal scheduling of
   existing systems. Case studies on three test systems verify the
   effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

   ensembles of neural network classifiers have been proposed to
   discriminate the human gender by using the information of moving joints
   of actors. With a database consisting of 13 males' and 13 females'
   movement, and containing 10 repetitions of knocking, waving and lifting
   movements both in neutral and angry style each, we have compared the
   results of ensembles to the conventional classifiers such as single MLP,
   decision tree, self-organizing map and support vector machine.
   Furthermore, the sensitivity has been calculated for the comparison with
   the human performance that has been obtained from the same data. The
   experimental results show that the ensemble models are much superior to

Title = {ClickLeak: Keystroke Leaks Through Multimodal Sensors in Cyber-Physical
   Social Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {27311-27321},
Abstract = {Public social environments are hot beds of security leaks, either they
   are virtual or physical. The nature of social settings allows numerous
   people to co-exist in the same space. This close un-bounded proximity
   opens up the possibility of privacy compromise in such environments. In
   this paper, we explore a novel and practical multi-modal side-channel
   keystroke recognition system, named ClickLeak, which can infer the PIN
   code/password entered on numeric keypad by using the commodity Wi-Fi
   devices. Such numeric keypads are commonly available in many public
   social environments. ClickLeak is built on the observation that each key
   input makes unique pattern of hand and finger movements, and this
   generates unique distortions to multi-path Wi-Fi signals. Acceleration
   and microphone sensors of smart phones determine the starting and ending
   time of keystrokes, while the time series of channel state information
   are analyzed to determine the keystrokes. The evaluation results have
   shown that with large scale data collections from public social
   settings, the key recognition accuracy can reach higher than 83\%.},

Abstract = {Satellite communication has made great progress in recent years since it
   is characterized by wide information coverage and can support diverse
   types of users, which beneficially fulfills the demand of beyond 5G
   communications. Besides, mobile edge computing (MEC) technologies
   energize the edge devices with computational abilities to deal with the
   majority of training tasks without having to upload to the cloud server,
   which substantially enhances a system's efficiency. In satellite MEC,
   the raw data of edge users vested in different owners cannot be allowed
   to be shared, considering data privacy requirements. To address this,
   federated learning (FL) architecture can be applied to satellite MEC
   where only parameters and model updates can be transmitted, which avoids
   the interaction of raw data from diverse sources. In this article, we
   construct a FL-based satellite MEC architecture, followed by introducing
   its key techniques in the aspects of resource management and multi-modal
   data fusion. Furthermore, we study the data privacy and security
   protection on the FL-aided satellite MEC relying on a blockchain
   framework. Finally, we portray the challenges of FL-aided satellite MEC
   systems.},

Title = {Roles of regional production in a global food system},

Volume = {36},
Number = {5},
Pages = {432-442},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {What is the role of Northeastern agricultural products in the US food
   system? This paper presents a typology that categorizes where
   agricultural production and distribution of a specific geographic area,
   in this case a multi-state region, fits within the US food system. The
   place of each food is defined based on its production volume, scope of
   distribution, market timing and agro-ecological niche. Six distinct
   roles that a region might play in supplying food are identified: (a) the
   region is a national production center, (b) the region is a seasonally
   important supplier, (c) regional production and distribution is the
   primary scale for supplying a food, (d) the product occupies an
   agro-ecological niche, (e) a product is a co-product of another industry
   in the region, and (f) the product is marketed explicitly for its
   geographic provenance as a local or regional product. Illustrative
   examples of each role are provided from the research of the Enhancing
   Food Security in the Northeast (EFSNE) regional food systems project.
   The examples draw from a variety of methodological approaches including
   regional self-reliance analysis, product case studies, supply chain
   models, and examination of spatial and temporal patterns in crop and
   livestock production and marketing. While presented in the context of
   the Northeast, the typology would likely be valuable for characterizing
   other regions of the country. We need such a typology to better
   understand and communicate the value of geographically dispersed
   agricultural production to creating a resilient food system, thereby
   improving our decisions of how to respond to future agricultural
   challenges},

Title = {On Transient Analysis of ?(N)-Markov Chains},
Journal = {METHODOLOGY AND COMPUTING IN APPLIED PROBABILITY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Consider a cyber-physical system which has the purpose of maintaining
   the security of some physical asset. A particularly relevant scenario is
   one in which the system must perform its functions while at the same
   time enduring malicious attacks for an extended amount of time without
   energy renewal. We will study a theoretical model analogous to this
   cyber-physical system with an arbitrary number of nodes. The nodes in
   this system are able to communicate with one another and have the task
   of maintaining the security of the system. Initially all nodes
   comprising this system are in working order, however, due to attacks
   they can eventually become corrupted and then work against the security
   of the system. Of particular interest is the calculation of a number of
   metrics related to reliability of the system including the reliability
   function and the mean-time to failure. A particular case of this model
   has been examined by many researchers in the past, mostly using
   numerical methods. The contribution of this paper is the presentation of
   explicit expressions for the transient-state transition probabilities,
   reliability function, and the mean-time to failure along with rigorous
   proofs for the validity of these expressions. A result such as this is
   stronger than previous results via numerical methods and is an extension
   of previous analytical results where additional constraints on the model
   were imposed.},

Pages = {16499-16507},

Abstract = {In recent times, security threats are predominant in almost all digital
   applications over the internet. One such threatening effect comes from
   GAMEOVER Zeus Botnet. These Botnets enter inside online networks and
   affect the Peer client list, through Internet Rely Chat (IRC). IRC
   includes applications like Tactical chat and On Chat. Zeus botnets
   gather the secret information of these users, such as bank data and
   military secrets. Moreover, the architecture is P2P and hence the
   location of GAMEOVER Zeus Botnet varies from the one to another botnets
   models. The threat of Zeus botnets loom large as they operate through
   the processes of identification of users, through which, they establish
   control over the hosts via P2P server. An intelligent method of
   identification of Zeus botnets in a distributed computing system using
   cryptographic schemes to defend against such attacks is the prime issue
   of research in this paper. An advanced Botnet capturing algorithm, named
   as modified cryptographic prefix IP anonymize (CPA) algorithm is
   proposed in this research paper to effectively counter the threats of
   Zeus bots. Essential features of the proposed CPA algorithm include
   prefixed IP mapped anonymizing in Internet Rely Chat, inbuilt adaptive
   security algorithm, which helps in network cleansing. If left unchecked,
   these Zeus botnets may result in consequent shutdown of the system.
   Hence, identification of the location of these botnets with the help of
   IP-prefix mapped method through modified CPA algorithm have been
   systematically presented in this paper.},

Abstract = {Biometric Authentication (BA) has turn out to be presently as key
   problem in privacy and security. Multimodal biometric system specializes
   in enhancing verification overall performance of the users for
   authentication. On this direction, biometrics which is the
   computer-based validation of an individuals' identification is turning
   into increasingly more vital, particularly for high security systems.
   The spirit of biometrics is the size of character's behavioral or
   physiological characteristics; it allows authentication of someone's
   identity. Biometric-based totally authentication is likewise turning
   into increasingly more essential in computer based applications because
   the quantity of touchy records saved in such structures is growing. The
   latest needs of biometric systems are robustness, high reputation
   quotes, capability to handle imprecision, uncertainties of
   non-statistical kind and magnanimous flexibility. Its miles precisely
   right here that, the role of soft computing techniques involves vital
   play. The primary aim of this write-up is to offer a practical view on
   applications of soft computing strategies in biometrics and to analyze
   its impact. It is found that soft computing has already made inroads in
   phrases of man or woman techniques or in combination. This paper
   additionally proposes as hybrid soft computing based optimization device
   named ``Adaptive Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (AFGA){''} which is adaptable
   to all of the unimodal and multimodal biometric authentication system.
   The results acquired by means of this device insure high standard of
   verification via multi-modal biometrics fusion by means of powerful
   functionality of fuzzy logic. Experimental investigation under various
   biometric data conditions exhibits notable effects over current

Title = {Grid Integration of Intermittent Wind Generation: A Markovian Approach},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {732-741},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Although the unique characteristics of intermittent wind generation have
   been acknowledged and drastic impacts of sudden wind drops have been
   experienced, no effective integration approach has been developed. In
   this paper, without considering transmission capacity constraints for
   simplicity, aggregated wind generation is modeled as a discrete Markov
   process with state transition matrices established based on historical
   data. Wind generation is then integrated into system demand with
   multiple net demand levels at each hour. To accommodate the uncertain
   net demand, a stochastic unit commitment problem is formulated based on
   states instead of scenarios. The objective is to minimize the total
   commitment cost of conventional generators and their total expected
   dispatch cost while satisfying all possible net demand levels. The
   advantage of this formulation is that the state at a time instant
   summarizes the information of all previous instants in a probabilistic
   sense for reduced complexity. With state transition probabilities given,
   state probabilities calculated before optimization, and the objective
   function and constraints formulated in a linear manner, the problem is
   effectively solved by using branch-and-cut. Numerical testing shows that
   the new Markovian approach is effective and robust through the examined
   cases, resembling the sudden wind drop in Texas in February 2008.},

Abstract = {The transformer is a pivotal device in substations, and its operational
   state is highly correlated to the security and reliability of a power
   system. Especially with the development of smart grid, the faults in
   transformers would have a severe negative impact, not only on the local
   power network, but also on the holistic power system and power grid. In
   this paper, we predominantly investigate the operating state diagnosis
   model of the oil-immersed transformer. Specifically, the common faults
   and their corresponding characteristics have been concluded. By the
   characterization of each fault, we can use the fuzzy synthetic
   evaluation model to diagnose whether a fault occurs and estimate its
   severity level as well as damage.},

Abstract = {Network based intrusions and information theft events are becoming more
   and more popular today. To bypass the network security devices such as
   firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) and web
   application firewall, attackers use evasive techniques to circumvent
   them, of which protocol mimicry is a very useful approach. The technique
   camouflages malicious communications as common protocols or generally
   innocent applications to avoid network security audit, which has been
   widely used in advanced Trojans, botnets, as well as anonymous
   communication systems, bringing a great challenge to current network
   management and security. To this end, we propose a general network
   protocol mimicry behavior discovery framework named MimicHunter to
   detect such evasive masquerade behaviors, which exploits protocol
   structure and state transition verifications, as well as primary
   protocol behavior elements. Experiment results on several datasets
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in practice. Besides,
   MimicHunter is flexible in deployment and can be easily implemented in
   passive detection systems with only a little cost compared with the
   active methods.},

Abstract = {With the rapid prevalence of smart mobile devices and the dramatic
   proliferation of mobile applications (Apps), App recommendation becomes
   an emergent task that will benefit different stockholders of mobile App
   ecosystems. However, the extreme sparsity of user-App matrix and many
   newly emerging Apps create severe challenges, causing CF-based methods
   to degrade significantly in their recommendation performance. Besides,
   unlike traditional items, Apps have rights to access users' personal
   resources (e.g., location, message and contact) which may lead to
   security risk or privacy leak. Thus, users' choosing of Apps are
   influenced by not only their personal interests but also their privacy
   preferences. Moreover, user privacy preferences vary with App
   categories. In light of the above challenges, we propose a mobile sparse
   additive generative model (Mobi-SAGE) to recommend Apps by considering
   both user interests and category-aware user privacy preferences in this
   paper. To overcome the challenges from data sparsity and cold start,
   Mobi-SAGE exploits both textual and visual content associated with Apps
   to learn multi-view topics for user interest modeling. We collected a
   large-scale and real-world dataset from 360 App store - the biggest
   Android App platform in China, and conducted extensive experiments on
   it. The experimental results demonstrate that our Mobi-SAGE consistently
   and significantly outperforms the other existing state-of-the-art
   methods, which implies the importance of exploiting category aware user
   privacy preferences and the multi-modal App content data on personalized
   App recommendation.},

Abstract = {The much-anticipated revolution of the ``Internet of things{''} (IoT) is
   expected to generate one trillion internet devices within the next 15
   years, mostly in the form of simple wireless sensor devices. While this
   revolution promises to transform silicon markets and drive a number of
   disruptive changes in society, it is also the case that the protocols,
   complexity, and security issues of extremely large dynamic, co-mingled
   networks is still poorly understood. Furthermore, embedded system
   developers, to include military and aerospace users, have largely
   ignored the potential (good and bound) of the cloudlike, possibly
   intermingling networks having variable structure to how future systems
   might be engineered. In this paper, we consider a new interpretation of
   IoT inspired modular architecture strategies involving the
   representational state transfer (REST) model, in which dynamic networks
   with variable structure employ stateless application programming
   interface (API) concepts. The power of the method, which extends
   concepts originally developed for space plug-and-play avionics, is that
   it allows for the fluid co-mingling of hardware and software in networks
   whose structure can overlap and evolve. Paradoxically, these systems may
   have the most stringent determinism and fault-tolerant needs. In this
   paper we review how RESTful APIs can potentially be used to design,
   create, test, and deploy systems rapidly while addressing security and
   referential integrity even when the nodes of many systems might
   physically co-mingle. We will also explore ways to take advantage of the
   RESTful paradigm for fault tolerance and what extensions might be
   necessary to deal with high-performance and determinism.},

Title = {Feasible operation region of an electricity distribution network{*}},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {331},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {In the course of net zero carbon transition, electricity distribution
   networks are faced with great challenges brought by increasing total and
   peak demand due to the electrification of transport and heat, as well as
   the significant uncertainties from renewable power generation and
   customer behaviors (such as electric vehicle travelling behaviors).
   Therefore, distribution network operators (DNOs) need effective tools to
   assess the capability of distribution networks in integrating generation
   and demand to conduct active management and efficient expansion of
   networks. However, conventional scenario-based assessment methods only
   provide conservative and limited information on the network capability,
   also with exponentially increased computational burden. By contrast,
   another stream of methods with different philosophy, named as operation
   region-based methods, describe the overall picture of the network
   capability analytically with little computational power needed. However,
   the existing linearized analytical regions, which are mainly applied to
   electricity transmission networks, cannot describe the capability of
   distribution networks accurately enough. To solve these problems, a
   novel feasible operation region (FOR) method with quadratic analytical
   expressions was proposed to characterize the range of the operating
   states of distribution networks, where the thermal and voltage
   constraints will not be violated. The FOR is a geometry in a
   high-dimensional space, and thus a high-dimensional error analysis
   approach was further developed for validating the proposed method. The
   boundary errors are described by multiple distance functions and
   operational indices, and the conservativeness of the analytical
   boundaries are quantified. An 11 kV radial distribution network from the
   United Kingdom Generic Distribution System (UKGDS) was used for the case
   study. The simulation results show that the quadratic analytical
   boundaries well approximated the real boundaries of FOR. The maximum
   errors for thermal and voltage boundaries would maximally cause an
   overcurrent up to 116 \% and an undervoltage down to 0.96p.u., which are
   able to satisfy the requirements of engineering practice. Compared to
   the existing linear approximation (termed as hyperplane expressions) of
   FOR boundaries, the proposed quadratic expressions were proved to have
   higher accuracy.},

Title = {A Refined Supervision Model of Rice Supply Chain Based on
   Multi-Blockchain},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {With the development of Agriculture 4.0, the requirements for
   sustainable agriculture and precision agriculture continue to grow. As
   one of the three major staple foods globally, the quality and safety of
   rice affect human health as well as social development. To ensure the
   quality and safety of rice and reduce the flow of problematic rice, a
   multi-layer blockchain-based rice supply chain refinement supervision
   model MBRRSM (Multi-blockchain Rice Refined Supervision Model) is
   proposed from the information level. First, the characteristics of
   information flow in the rice supply chain are analyzed, and a
   classification table of key information is constructed. Second, the
   MBRRSM framework is designed. Based on a multi-party hybrid encryption
   algorithm, secure multi-party computing algorithm, multi-mode storage
   mechanism, and SPOP (Supervision Proof of Peers) consensus algorithm, a
   set of mechanisms is designed for the transmission, use, storage, and
   consensus of rice data in MBRRSM. Subsequently, the security and
   performance capabilities of MBRRSM are analyzed. Meanwhile, the SPOP
   consensus algorithm is analyzed. Finally, a prototype system is built
   based on MBRRSM and verified through exemplary scenarios in different
   usage situations. The results show that research on the refined
   supervision of the rice supply chain based on multi-blockchain can
   finely supervise all types of data in the rice supply chain, and provide
   a guarantee for enterprise users to safely transmit and use data with
   different privacy levels. This study presents a unique research paradigm
   that introduces the theories and methods of the new information field
   generation into the field of agricultural research, and thus assists in
   the strategy implementation of ``holding grain in the land and storing
   grain in technology{''}.},

Abstract = {Currently used in mobile devices PIN-based user authentication cannot
   provide. a sufficient security level. Methods based on multi-modal user
   authentication involving biometrics (i.e. physical and behavioral
   characteristics of a person) may be employed to cope with this problem.
   However, dealing with physical characteristics only, these methods are
   either unable to provide continuous and user-friendly identity
   verification, or are resource consuming.
   In this paper, we aim at the provision of continuous, user-friendly and
   accurate verification of the user identity while preserving scarce
   resources of a mobile device. Rather than physical, behavioral
   characteristics are analyzed. The normal behavior of the user is modeled
   by a set of complementary behavioral aspects that can be used to
   uniquely identify the user. We develop an approach, where these aspects
   are separately monitored by dedicated software-based experts. By
   analyzing the deviations of the current behavior from the modeled one,
   each expert infers separately its decision about the user identity. The
   final decision is derived from these multiple expert decisions by
   applying a decision fusion technique. The monitoring of multiple
   behavioral aspects helps to improve the authentication accuracy and
   enables the continuous verification of the user identity. The
   user-friendliness is supported by the use of transparent authentication
   methods that do not require direct user participation. Finally, the
   analysis of behavioral characteristics and the decision fusion process
   do not involve complicated computational steps and, therefore, are
   conservative in resource consumption.},

Abstract = {In this article, a risk-constrained stochastic framework is presented
   for joint energy and reserve scheduling of a resilient microgrid
   considering demand side management. The optimization problem is
   formulated to schedule the system operation in both normal and islanding
   modes by addressing the prevailing uncertainties of islanding duration
   as well as prediction errors of loads, renewable power generation, and
   electricity price. In a normal operation mode, where the grid-connection
   is available, the energy and reserve of local resources and energy
   trading with the main grid is scheduled to maximize the operator's
   profit considering feasible islanding. In a resilient operating mode,
   which is triggered by a disturbance in the main grid, the local
   resources should be scheduled to supply loads with the lowest emergency
   load shedding. To balance the economy and security requirements under
   uncertainties, the optimal scheduling is done properly through a
   security-constrained power flow method by considering system's
   objectives and constraints. Moreover, to properly handle the
   uncertainties of the problem, conditional value-at-risk metric is
   incorporated with the optimization model to control the risk of profit
   variability. The proposed scheme is implemented on a test microgrid and
   various case studies are presented to verify its effectiveness in normal
   and resiliency operating conditions.},

Title = {Environmental assessment of sustainable energy options for multi-effect
   distillation of brackish water in isolated communities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {213},
Pages = {1371-1379},

Abstract = {Access to sufficient quantities of fresh water is becoming increasingly
   difficult, especially in dry regions. Moreover, high levels of salinity,
   arsenic and boron are further limiting the access to quality fresh water
   in many isolated communities worldwide. This paper evaluates the life
   cycle environmental impacts of a small multi-effect distillation (MED)
   plant, treating brackish water with high levels of these metalloids in
   an isolated location in Northern Chile. The facility currently operates
   solely with electricity from a diesel generator and heat from a biomass
   boiler. In order to evaluate the environmental impacts of more
   sustainable energy options, the implications of the use of solar fields
   and grid electricity as potential alternatives have been analysed. The
   results demonstrate that coupling solar fields and grid electricity is
   the best option, sharply decreasing impact in most categories in
   comparison to the current operating mode of the plant. This was
   attributed to the impact savings from reducing/eliminating onsite diesel
   and biomass combustion, and their associated transportation to the
   plant. For MED desalination in off-the-grid areas, the use of solar
   energy is highly recommended as an alternative to complement the use of
   diesel and biomass, especially if the latter is not nearby the unit. The
   concentration of arsenic and boron was reduced to below the required
   standards for irrigation and livestock consumption. The article
   concludes that the use of solar energy and grid electricity are
   environmentally beneficial for the production of quality fresh water
   from brackish water using MED at isolated communities. (C) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {In order to provide integrity protection for the secure operating system
   to satisfy the structured protection class' requirements, a DTE
   technique based integrity protection formalization model is proposed
   after the implications and structures of the integrity policy have been
   analyzed in detail. This model consists of some basic rules for
   configuring DTE and a state transition model, which are used to instruct
   how the domains and types are set, and how security invariants obtained
   from initial configuration are maintained in the process of system
   transition respectively. In this model, ten invariants are introduced,
   especially, some new invariants dealing with information flow are
   proposed, and their relations with corresponding invariants described in
   literatures are also discussed. The thirteen transition rules with
   well-formed atomicity are presented in a well-operational manner. The
   basic security theorems correspond to these invariants and transition
   rules are proved. The rationalities for proposing the invariants are
   further annotated via analyzing the differences between this model and
   ones described in literatures. At last but not least, future works are
   prospected, especially, it is pointed out that it is possible to use
   this model to analyze SE-Linux security.},

Abstract = {The use of digital content is increasing day after day and now it is an
   essential element of our day today life. The amount of stored
   information is so huge that it is highly difficult to manage the content
   especially in a distributed cloud environment. There are many open
   source software solutions available in cloud to handle huge amount of
   digital data. However none of these solutions addresses all the
   requirements needed to manage the content spread out in multiple systems
   effectively. The user has to relay on multiple content management
   systems to do the work. This turns into ever more unwieldy, time
   consuming and leads to loss of data. Using robust and integrated content
   management systems, these issues could be solved effectively. In this
   paper we have identified various challenges of using the content
   management system in the cloud after surveying many Content Management
   System related article and proposed an integrated solution named Cloud
   based Architecture integrating Content Management System which is
   capable of interfacing with various unique features available at
   different content management system installations in the cloud. This
   maximizes the functionality and performance of any Content management
   systems. The Representational State Transfer (REST) protocol is used to
   integrate the best features of various open source content management
   systems. REST provides higher level of security compared to existing
   systems as it does not store the user sessions. The users can interact
   with the system with the help of an interface which abstracts the
   complexities of multiple content management systems running in the
   cloud.},

Abstract = {Recently, renewable distributed generation (DG) systems have emerged to
   improve the power system security and reliability while reducing the
   environmental incompatibility of fossil fuel power plants. DG could
   operate either as a standalone and/or as a grid-connected power system.
   The interfacing circuits of DG and their controls have to comply with
   utility quality regulations and afford a seamless transition from online
   to offline and vice versa. This article advises a simple and robust
   control scheme for a modular multilevel converter (MMC) that interfaces
   with a photovoltaic (PV) generator. The proposed control method ensures
   high-quality output voltage/current waveform in online and/or offline
   operating modes. Moreover, the proposed control provides a seamless and
   swift transition from standalone to grid-connected and vice versa. The
   exhibited control scheme is simulated with MATLAB/Simulink. Real-time
   simulator OPAL-RT OP4510 is used to verify the displayed simulation
   results. The simulation results determine the accomplishment of the
   proposed control technique for a seamless transition from the
   grid-connected mode to the standalone mode and vice versa via MMC.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) and its security issues have been gaining
   increasing attention in recent years due to the increasing number of
   threats and attacks against IoT devices. Specifically, false data
   injection attacks aim at tampering with the sensed data that reflect the
   normal system operation state. Therefore, a time-efficient and accurate
   approach to assessing sensor trustworthiness is necessary. To this end,
   we propose T-LHDM (a trust model based on low and high decision-making
   processes), a sensor state trust model based on a Markov chain to
   represent sensor state transitions in normal operating conditions. To
   demonstrate the model, we first observed sensed data in a hierarchical
   decision-making process by intentionally exploiting the sensor data's
   temporal and spatial correlations. Then, the consistency between the
   precomputed set of sensor state transitions and the observed ones was
   used to detect corruptions and assess the sensor trustworthiness. Our
   experiments using two real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed
   model accurately assessed the sensor trustworthiness with an average
   accuracy of 95\%. We also stress the significance of considering the
   sensor's spatiotemporal correlations to assess the trust of the sensed
   data, which has been neglected in previous studies. To this end, we
   conducted a comparative evaluation against a contemporary temporal
   correlation-based method and three well-known correlation tests. The
   results showed that T-LHDM outperformed all the competing methods.},

Abstract = {Smart grid defines an innovative research dimension in the area of power
   systems. Modern power systems are based on highly integrated, flexible
   networked and communicative cyber-physical infrastructure. This type of
   approach is extremely helpful in solving various reliability and
   security issues that arise due to the complexity of these systems.
   Utilizing different control mechanisms for optimal control of a system
   under different operating conditions and in different operating states,
   a hybrid control technique puts forth an active paradigm for control
   design of such a system. This paper presents a unique approach for
   modeling, control and safety verification of a smart grid considering
   its hybrid and complex nature. A model of smart grid has been designed
   in MATLAB and hybrid control is implemented for operation under
   different physical conditions. The stochastic nature of system for fault
   condition is also taken into account. Finally, the design scheme has
   been verified to give the desired results in which a reliable, efficient
   and safe operation is the output.},

Abstract = {There are only a few learning algorithms applicable to stochastic
   dynamic teams and games which generalize Markov decision processes to
   decentralized stochastic control problems involving possibly
   self-interested decision makers. Learning in games is generally
   difficult because of the non-stationary environment in which each
   decision maker aims to learn its optimal decisions with minimal
   information in the presence of the other decision makers who are also
   learning. In stochastic dynamic games, learning is more challenging
   because, while learning, the decision makers alter the state of the
   system and hence the future cost. In this paper, we present
   decentralized Q-learning algorithms for stochastic games, and study
   their convergence for the weakly acyclic case which includes team
   problems as an important special case. The algorithms are decentralized
   in that each decision maker has access only to its own decisions and
   cost realizations as well as the state transitions; in particular, each
   decision maker is completely oblivious to the presence of the other
   decision makers. We show that these algorithms converge to equilibrium
   policies almost surely in large classes of stochastic games.},

Abstract = {Traditional risk assessment methods adopt the long-term failure model of
   element and severity indices to characterize the failure probability and
   its impact on the power system respectively. However, in the actual
   system, the failure probability has time-varying characteristic due to
   the influence of the internal system and the external environment.
   Severity indices are formed by weighting each severity in the system,
   and weight coefficients are selected based on different focus, with
   subjective and hypothetical premises. A new assessment method which uses
   the credibility measure to establish the probability of component
   failure and global fuzzy security index to measure the severity of the
   accident is proposed. N-1 contingencies are chosen as initiating event
   of cascading failure and risk ranking. The results of risk ranking of
   N-1 contingency analysis is regarded as initiating event of the next
   simulation layer to obtain collapse sequences. As a case study, RSTS
   six-bus system is simulated. The obtained results have shown that the
   proposed method is more accordant to actual power system operating
   states and it is with better rationality and validity.},

Abstract = {Opacity is a confidentiality property that characterizes whether a
   ``secret{''} of a system can be inferred by an outside observer called
   an ``intruder{''}. In this paper, we consider the problem of enforcing
   opacity in systems modeled as partially-observed finite-state automata.
   We propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion
   functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output
   of the system that changes the system's output behavior by inserting
   additional observable events. We define the property of
   ``i-enforceability{''} that an insertion function needs to satisfy in
   order to enforce opacity. I-enforceability captures an insertion
   function's ability to respond to every system's observed behavior and to
   output only modified behaviors that look like existing non-secret
   behaviors. Given an insertion function, we provide an algorithm that
   verifies whether it is i-enforcing. More generally, given an opacity
   notion, we determine whether it is i-enforceable or not by constructing
   a structure called the ``All Insertion Structure{''} (AIS). The AIS
   enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in a compact state
   transition structure. If a given opacity notion has been verified to be
   i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to synthesize an i-enforcing
   insertion function. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The efficiency of a biometric system is identified by the detection
   error tradeoff (DET) curve, which is a visual characterization of the
   trade-off between the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and the False
   Rejection Rate (FRR). A DET curve is a plot of FAR against FRR for
   various threshold values, t. FRR refers to the expected probability that
   two mate samples (samples of the same biometric trait obtained from the
   same user) will be falsely declared as a non-match whereas FAR is the
   expected probability that two non-mate samples will be incorrectly
   recognized as a match. The threshold t defines how much the biometric
   characteristics must be similar, in order to make a positive comparison,
   so it measures the correspondence between characteristic to check and
   template stored in the database. By elevating the threshold, the risk
   that not authorized users can fool the system diminishes, but, on the
   other hand, it is more probable that some authorized users can sometimes
   be refused. In this work, we present the results for SpeechXRays
   multi-modal biometric system that uses audio-visual characteristics for
   user authentication in an eHealth platform for osteoarthritis
   management. Using the privacy and security mechanism provided by
   SpeechXrays based on audio and video biometrics medical personnel is
   able to be verified and subsequently identified to the eHealth

Abstract = {Choosing the right security measures and responses is an important and
   challenging part of designing an Intrusion Response System. This article
   proposes a stochastic game based approach to security and intrusion
   response in enterprise networks. To analyze the intrusion response
   scenario, this paper formally represents the real-time interaction of an
   attacker and network administrator as a two-player non-zero-sum
   stochastic game. The network configuration information and vulnerability
   scan results of an enterprise network are used to construct a network
   security state space, where a network security state changes as a result
   of actions taken by the attacker/administrator. Using the modeled
   stochastic game, a quantitative decision making framework has been
   proposed for enterprise network administrators to identify his optimal
   actions in case of network intrusion. Experimentations show that
   proposed model scales well with networks consisting of number of hosts
   in order of hundreds.},

Abstract = {Where customers with different membership and position, use computers as
   in the university network systems, it often takes much time and efforts
   for them to cope with the change of the system management. This is
   because the requirements for the respective computer usage are different
   in the network and security policies. In this paper, a new destination
   addressing control system (DACS) scheme for the university network
   services is proposed. The DACS Scheme performs the network services
   efficiently through the communication management of a client. As the
   characteristic of DACS Scheme, only the setup modification is required
   by a system administrator, when the configuration change is needed in
   the network server. Then, the setup modification is unnecessary by a
   customer, which shows a merit for both a system administrator and a
   customer. This paper describes the instruction and the prototype for
   DACS Protocol as the implementation of DACS Scheme. Then, the simplicity
   of the system management in DACS Scheme, is examined from the customer
   and the system administrator viewpoints.},

Abstract = {Communication in networked systems must be reliable during run time data
   exchanges. Therefore, their specifications and designs must be clear,
   understandable and follow specific rules. Indeed, these systems must
   guard against potential failures in preventing faults and associated
   errors, failures or allowing a degraded operating modes in order to
   protect against global system failures while maintaining a minimum of
   functionality in the case of irreversible failures, thanks to fault
   tolerant and security mechanisms. Given challenges of verification by
   simulation of these complex systems have made the huge number of
   possible states of carrying operation, and to ensure reliability
   requirements, we propose a formal proof verification as an alternative
   operation and validation blocks against defects through one proposed
   self-adaptive fault tolerance paradigm suitable for occurred errors of
   networked embedded systems. The formalization process based on an
   incremental and validated correct-by-construction development of the
   proposed reliability mechanisms are designed and proved in order to
   ensure accuracy operating required related dependability of
   communication wireless networked systems.},

   development of novel methods of threat detection in the realistic
   environment of the Hudson River Estuary. In MSL, this is done through a
   multi-modal interdisciplinary approach. In this paper, underwater
   acoustic measurements and video surveillance are combined. Stevens'
   researchers have developed a specialized prototype video system to
   identify, video-capture, and map surface ships in a sector of the
   estuary. The combination of acoustic noise with video data for different
   kinds of ships in Hudson River enabled estimation of sound attenuation
   in a wide frequency band. Also, it enabled the collection of a noise
   library of various ships that can be used for ship classification by
   passive acoustic methods. Acoustics and video can be used to determine a
   ship's position. This knowledge can be used for ship noise suppression
   in hydrophone arrays in underwater threat detection. Preliminary
   experimental results of position determination are presented in the

Abstract = {One of the goals of Artificial intelligence (AI) is the realization of
   natural dialogue between humans and machines. in recent years, the
   dialogue systems, also known as interactive conversational systems are

   systems technology to establish various kinds of Virtual Personal
   Assistants(VPAs) based on their applications and areas, such as
   Microsoft's Cortana, Apple's Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and
   Facebook's M. However, in this proposal, we have used the multi- modal
   dialogue systems which process two or more combined user input modes,
   such as speech, image, video, touch, manual gestures, gaze, and head and
   body movement in order to design the NextGeneration of VPAs model. The
   new model of VPAs will be used to increase the interaction between
   humans and the machines by using different technologies, such as gesture
   recognition, image/ video recognition, speech recognition, the vast
   dialogue and conversational knowledge base, and the general knowledge
   base. Moreover, the new VPAs system can be used in other different areas
   of applications, including education assistance, medical assistance,
   robotics and vehicles, disabilities systems, home automation, and

Abstract = {A spectral sensing method with sufficient sensitivity to detect vapors
   of low vapor-pressure compounds such as explosives would have great
   promise for defense and security applications. An opportunity is
   Intracavity Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (ICLAS) at IR wavelengths. Our
   approach is based on multi-mode external-cavity quantum cascade lasers
   and a scanning Fabry-Perot spectrometer to analyze the laser mode
   spectrum in the presence of a narrow band intracavity absorber. This
   paper presents results of numerical solution of laser rate equations
   that support feasibility of kilometer effective active-cavity path
   lengths and sensitivity to concentrations of 10 ppb. This is comparable
   to the saturated vapor pressure of TNT. System design considerations and
   first experimental results are presented at 10 and 70 mu m wavelengths.},

Title = {Configuration-controllable porous metamaterial and its bandgap
   characteristics: Experimental and numerical analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {535},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {Metamaterials that can tune the bandgap by controlling the configuration
   have prospects for the security of engineering structures. A
   configuration-controllable metamaterial is developed in this study to
   achieve effective vibration reduction, and its bandgap characteristics
   are investigated through experiments and numerical analysis. The
   metamaterial specimen is designed and fabri-cated using silicone rubber.
   A corresponding experimental platform is constructed to achieve a
   controllable configuration of the metamaterial. Subsequently, the
   vibration transmission of the specimen with different deformations is
   tested. The commercial software COMSOL is used to simulate
   finite-element dynamic models of the unit cell, and the entire
   structures of the meta -material is established to analyze their
   bandgaps and frequency response characteristics. Both the numerical and
   experimental results demonstrate that the configuration change can
   significantly affect the bandgap characteristics. With increasing
   compression, the existing low-frequency bandwidth of the metamaterial
   narrow, whereas the high-frequency bandwidth broadens. When the
   metamaterial deformation is larger, a new bandgap appears at a lower
   frequency. In addition, the effects of the geometric parameters on the
   bandgaps are revealed. It shows that the frequency range, width and
   number of bandgaps of the developed metamaterial can be effectively
   adjusted through configuration control.},

Title = {A Novel Energy-efficient Authentication Data Distribution Scheme for

Journal = {INFORMATION-AN INTERNATIONAL INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1303-1313},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This paper firstly puts forward an energy-efficient authentication data
   distribution scheme, which is composed of two parts, one is for relative
   statistic occasions when multi-mode UE (User Equipment) moves only in
   its own home domain, the other one is for dynamic cases especially when
   UE transfers frequently between different domains. Meanwhile, an
   improved authentication protocol based on authentication vectors (AV) is
   proposed, and the relative security analysis is given as well. Similar
   as EAP-AKA, we assume that the first registered 3GPP AAA server in home
   domain (i.e. HPLMN, Home Public Land Mobile Network) takes charge of the
   responsibility of authentication for 3GPP/WiMAX UE by using AVs obtained
   from HSS (Home Subscriber Server). Using of this scheme, it is
   unnecessary to retrieve new AVs from HSS, if there are still unused AVs
   for the previous PLMN when the multi-mode UE leaves and reenters the
   same PLMN within its available period of critical period interval (CPI).
   Theoretical analysis show that a long CPI results in fewer accesses to
   the HSS, and only through adjusting the CPI period dynamically in
   accordance with the system parameters, the signaling cost can be reduced
   further, so as to achieve the energy-efficient purpose.},

Title = {Gas supply reliability assessment of natural gas transmission pipeline
   systems},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {162},
Pages = {853-870},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The uncertainty of market demand and dynamic behaviour of the pipeline
   system are usually ignored in previous gas supply reliability
   assessments. With the intent of overcoming these deficiencies, a novel
   methodology to assess the gas supply reliability of natural gas
   transmission pipeline systems is proposed in this paper. Considering
   both gas supply capacity and market demand uncertainties, calculations
   of these two items are integrated into a single Monte Carlo simulation,
   On each Monte Carlo trial, the hydraulic analysis of unsteady flow is
   combined with the state transition process simulation to calculate the
   gas supply capacity. In terms of market demand, the load duration curve
   technology is employed to predict the amount of demand. Then, the
   indicator proposed to quantify gas supply reliability is calculated on
   each trial. Finally, the average gas supply reliability is obtained
   based on N Monte Carlo trials. Applications of this methodology are
   demonstrated through a real transmission pipeline system. Thereafter,
   the method is compared with previous approaches and differences are
   discussed. Furthermore, the impacts of supply capacity and market demand
   uncertainties on the gas supply reliability are investigated and
   suggestions to improve the gas supply reliability are proposed. (C) 2018

Title = {Islanding Control Architecture in future smart grid with both demand and
   wind turbine control},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {95},
Pages = {214-224},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, a large number of Distributed Generation units (DG
   units) such as Wind Turbines (WTs) and Combined Heat and Power plants
   (CHPs) have been penetrating the distribution systems. Meanwhile, an
   intentional island operation of distribution systems is proposed as a
   potential measure against power supply outages by continuously running
   DG units during system emergencies. However, there are some challenging
   security issues for an island operation, such as the power imbalance
   during the islanding transition and the coordination of feeder
   protection systems. To tackle the former issue, which is the focus of
   this paper, available resources including both DG units and demand
   should be fully utilized as reserves. The control and coordination among
   different resources requires an integral architecture to serve the
   purpose. This paper develops the Istanding Control Architecture (ICA)
   for future smart grid, based on the Istanding Security Region (ISR)
   concept. With the ISR, system operators can assess beforehand if an
   island operation can be successful for a given distribution system at
   its current operating state. In case of unfavorable assessment, control
   measures will be suggested to coordinate different resources, aiming at
   pulling the system back into the ISR to ensure a successful island
   operation on time. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Penetration testing is a well-established practical concept for the
   identification of potentially exploitable security weaknesses and an
   important component of a security audit. Providing a holistic security
   assessment for networks consisting of several hundreds hosts is hardly
   feasible though without some sort of mechanization. Mitigation,
   prioritizing counter-measures subject to a given budget, currently lacks
   a solid theoretical understanding and is hence more art than science. In
   this work, we propose the first approach for conducting comprehensive
   what-if analyses in order to reason about mitigation in a conceptually
   well-founded manner. To evaluate and compare mitigation strategies, we
   use simulated penetration testing, i.e., automated attack-finding, based
   on a network model to which a subset of a given set of mitigation
   actions, e.g., changes to the network topology, system updates,
   configuration changes etc. is applied. Using Stackelberg planning, we
   determine optimal combinations that minimize the maximal attacker
   success (similar to a Stackelberg game), and thus provide a well-founded
   basis for a holistic mitigation strategy. We show that these Stackelberg
   planning models can largely be derived from network scan, public
   vulnerability databases and manual inspection with various degrees of
   automation and detail, and we simulate mitigation analysis on networks
   of different size and vulnerability.},

Title = {A Modified Modulation Strategy for an Active Neutral-Point-Clamped

Abstract = {With the development of 1500 V photovoltaic (PV) systems in recent
   decades, multilevel inverters such as the five-level inverter have
   gained much attention for their higher equivalent output frequency and
   low semiconductor devices' voltage stress. Among five-level inverters,
   the active neutral-point-clamped five-level (ANPC-5L) inverter is very
   competitive due to its simple structure and control methods. However,
   with its conventional commutation strategy, the topology of the ANPC
   five-level converter has the security risk of overvoltage in the power
   device when switching to dead time under special conditions, which
   affects the reliability and safety of the switch state switching
   process. In this paper, this issue is analyzed in detail and a modified
   commutation strategy is proposed. Meanwhile, a novel soft start-up
   method adopted to an ANPC-5L inverter is also proposed. A prototype is
   also set up to analyze the issue of traditional switching commutation
   strategies and to verify the effectiveness of the proposed commutation
   strategy and the soft start-up method.},

   YCbCr colour space to determine the locations of the eyes. The centre of
   the mouth is determined relative to the locations of the eyes. Facial
   and mouth features are extracted using multiscale morphological erosion
   and dilation operations, respectively. The facial features are extracted
   relative to the locations of the eyes, and mouth features are extracted
   relative to the locations of the eyes and mouth. Fovea intensity
   comparison code and exclusive-OR operation for matching are used to
   recognise a person in video sequences. Projected fovea intensity
   comparison code (PFICC) and Euclidean distance for matching are also
   used to recognise a person in video sequences. The performance of the
   system using PFICC is evaluated in real time in the laboratory
   environment, and the system achieves a recognition rate (RR) of 99.0\%
   and an equal error rate (EER) of about 0.84\% for 50 subjects. The
   performance of the system is also evaluated for the eXtended Multi Modal
   Verification for Teleservices and Security (XM2VTS) database, and the
   system achieves an RR of 100\% and an EER of about 0.23\%.},

   local experience data and nationwide public data. The following policy
   effect will be anticipated. If an LTCI beneficiary falls into a certain
   required care status, his or her required care benefit will need to be
   upgraded and the individual expense burden will increase. A similar
   approach is proposed by annuity products in the private sector such as

Title = {Two-stage distributionally robust optimization for joint system design
   and maintenance scheduling in high-consequence systems},
Journal = {IISE TRANSACTIONS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 5},
Abstract = {The failures of high-consequence systems can cause serious harm to
   humans, including loss of human health, life security, finance, and even
   social chaos. To protect high-consequence systems, both optimal system
   design and maintenance activities contribute to improving system
   reliability and social safety. The existing works generally optimize
   these two problems sequentially and assume that the degradation process
   of components is precisely known. However, sequential optimization often
   results in significant losses due to redundancies, and such a
   presumption usually cannot be guaranteed in practice, due to limited
   historical data or a lack of expert knowledge, referred to as epistemic
   uncertainty. To fill this gap, in this article, we consider an
   integrated optimization of system design and maintenance scheduling for
   multi-state high-consequence systems in which the component's
   degradation is known with limited distributional information. To address
   this issue, we utilize the framework of distributionally robust
   optimization to provide a risk-averse decision to decision-makers even
   under the worst realizations of random parameters, and develop a
   two-stage integer distributionally robust model with moment-based
   ambiguity set to determine the system design and maintenance scheduling
   simultaneously. The proposed model can be converted to a tractable
   approximation as an integer linear stochastic programming problem. In
   order to solve large-scale problems, we develop a sample-based adaptive
   large neighborhood search algorithm to find the optimal system designs.
   In the numerical experiments, we present a case study on feedwater
   heating systems in nuclear power plants and demonstrate that an
   integrated optimization consideration creates significant benefits in
   profitability. We also present the out-of-sample performance of the
   distributionally robust design to avoid extreme risk.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) provides convenience for our daily lives
   via a huge number of devices. However, due to low-resource and poor
   computing capability, these devices have a high number of firmware
   vulnerabilities. Software verification is a powerful solution to ensure
   the correctness and security of IoT firmware programs. Unfortunately,
   due to the complex semantics and syntax of program languages (typically
   C), applying software verification in IoT firmware faces the tradeoff
   between efficiency and accuracy. One of the fundamental reasons is that
   verification methods cannot support verifying state transitions on the
   memory space caused by pointer operations well. To this end, by
   combining sparse value flow (SVF) analysis into model checking and
   optimizing computational redundancy among them, we design a novel
   points-to-sensitive model checker, called PCHECKER, which can provide a
   highly precise and efficient verification for IoT firmware programs. We
   first design a spatial flow model to effectively describe state
   behaviors of a C program both on the symbolic and memory space. We then
   propose a counterexample-guided model checking algorithm that can
   dynamically refine abstract precisions and update nondeterministic
   points-to relations. With a set of C benchmarks containing a variety of
   pointer operations and other complex C features, our experiments have
   shown that compared with state of the art (SOTA), PCHECKER can achieve
   outstanding results in the verification tasks of C programs that its
   verification accuracy is 95.9\%, and its average verification time of
   each line of code is 1.27 ms, which are both better than existing model
   checkers.},

Journal = {AGEING \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1963-1994},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Previous research unequivocally shows that immigrants are less
   successful in the labour market than the native-born population.
   However, little is known about whether ethnic inequality persists after
   retirement. We use data on 16 Western European countries from the
   European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC,
   2004-2013) to provide the first comparative study of ethnic inequalities
   among the population aged 65 and older. We focus on the retirement
   income gap (RIG) between immigrants from non-European Union countries
   and relate its magnitude to country differences in welfare state
   arrangements. Ethnic inequality after retirement is substantial: after
   adjusting for key characteristics including age, education and
   occupational status, the average immigrant penalty across the 16
   countries is 28 per cent for men and 29 per cent for women.
   Country-level regressions show that income gaps are smaller in countries
   where the pension system is more redistributive. We also find that easy
   access to long-term residence is associated with larger RIGs, at least
   for men. There is no clear evidence that immigrants' access to social
   security programmes, welfare state transfers to working-age households
   or the strictness of employment protection legislation affect the size
   of the RIG.},

Abstract = {The comprehensive evolution of information communication technologies on
   mobile sensing objects has led to the provision of versatile ubiquitous
   network services embedded with specific-purpose modern sensors and
   intelligent wearable devices. The universal Internet connectivity of
   such smart objects has brought about a new era of ubiquitous application
   development for the Internet of Things. Meanwhile, security has become
   critically important. In the past decade, academia and industry have
   dedicated great efforts to the design of continuous authentication for
   multi-modal networks. Multiform authentication bio-tokens have been
   introduced for continuous entity identification and verification. With
   the rapid growth and universality of wearable devices, in this article
   we target continuous authentication for the IoT-based environment with
   users possessing wearable healthcare (and wellness) related smart
   objects. To present the state of the art, we provide a comprehensive
   review of continuous authentication in recent years. Critical
   characteristics of new biometrics are then introduced. Second, we
   present a wearable plantar bio-feature extractor constructed via
   commercial pressure sensors and the Raspberry PI platform. The prototype
   is adopted to retrieve user plantar bio-data as the raw (and training)
   data in the proposed authentication system. Third, we apply
   machine-learning-based techniques to derive a user's plantar
   bio-features as authentication tokens in the system to support continual
   (and real-time) entity verification in the background without the user's
   notice.},

Abstract = {The notorious attacks of the last few years have propelled cyber
   security to the top of the boardroom agenda, and raised the level of
   criticality to new heights. Therefore, building a secure system has
   become an important issue that cannot be delayed. In this paper, we
   propose an intrusion detection approach based on incremental long
   short-term memory to detect attacks. In order to capture the dynamic
   information of traffic, we introduce increment which is calculated as
   the product of function and derivative to long short-term memory (LSTM).
   Furthermore, the state change are applied to LSTM which is considered as
   incremental LSTM. Finally, we analyzed the effect of the state change on
   the performance of incremental LSTM by experiments. Experiments show
   that the intrusion detection method based on incremental LSTM has a
   higher accuracy than other methods.},

Abstract = {Distributed Energy Resources (DER) penetration has a significant impact
   on the distribution protection system. Current flow during short-circuit
   and load flow depend on DERs' operating state, generated power, and
   short-circuits contribution as well as consumer loads. The more DER
   integration leads to more challenge to maintaining DER, feeder, and
   substation protections sensitive, selective, with fast response, and
   optimum reliability.
   The IEEE 34 Node Test Feeder used and extended by addition of
   photovoltaic, wind, and energy storage DERs. Consumer loads and DER's
   generation were extended from static values to typical load and
   generation profiles, which examined daily, weekly, and seasonal
   patterns. Protection device settings were calculated selectively in the
   absence of DERs. Using the method of Protection Security Assessment
   (PSA), automatically evaluate the correct operation of protection
   devices in case of different fault scenarios. Three-phase and
   single-phase metallic faults are applied to validate protection system
   security. The PSA reassessed DER contribution and influence on
   protection selectivity. Adaptive rules should fix identified
   miss-coordinations by modifying protection settings or feeder automation
   logic. This paper applied adaptive rules to improve protection settings.
   The PSA method and adaptive rules assumed for implementation in an
   Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS).},

Abstract = {We give an overview of the tools to detect computer viruses without
   relying on ``pattern files{''} that contain ``signatures{''} of
   previously captured viruses. The system combines static code analysis
   with code simulation to identify malicious behaviors commonly found in
   computer viruses such as mass mailing, file infection, and registry
   overwrite. These prohibited behaviors are defined separately as security
   policies at the level of API library function calls in a
   state-transition like manner. The current tools target at Win32 binary
   viruses on Intel IA32 architectures and early experiments show that they
   can detect most email viruses that had spread in the wild in recent
   years.},

Abstract = {New forms of multimedia data (such as text, numbers, tags, networking,
   signals, geo-tagged information, graphs/relationships,
   three-dimensional/VR/AR and sensor data, etc.) have emerged in many
   applications in addition to traditional multimedia data (image, video,
   audio). Multimedia has become the biggest of big data as the foundation
   of today's data-driven discoveries. Almost all disciplines of science
   and engineering, as well as social sciences, involve multimedia data in
   some forms, such as recording experiments, driverless cars, unmanned
   aerial vehicles, smart communities, biomedical instruments, security
   surveillance. Some recent events demonstrate the power of real-time
   broadcast of unfolding events on social networks. Multimedia data is not
   just big in volume, but also multi-modal and mostly unstructured.
   Storing, indexing, searching, integrating, and recognizing from the vast
   amounts of data create unprecedented challenges. Even though significant
   progress has been made processing multimedia data, today's solutions are
   inadequate in handling data from millions of sources simultaneously.
   The IEEE International Conference on Multimedia Information Processing
   and Retrieval (IEEE-MIPR) aims to provide a forum for original research
   contributions and practical system design, implementation, and
   applications of multimedia information processing and retrieval for
   single modality or multiple modalities. The target audiences are
   university researchers, scientists, industry practitioners, software
   engineers, and graduate students who want to become acquainted with
   technologies for big data analytics, machine intelligence, information
   fusion in multimedia information processing and retrieval.
   Following a successful debut in Miami, Florida in 2018, the second MIPR,
   held in San Jose, California, attracted over 140 submissions and more
   than 100 attendees-a big growth from its inaugural event and an
   indication of its growing visibility and popularity in the multimedia
   research society. In addition to four keynote talks, MIPR'19 also
   featured six innovation multimedia forums organized by both academic and
   industrial researchers, with topics ranging from computer vision,
   self-driving, Natural Language Processing, next generation video
   display, to cutting edge video/audio coding techniques.},

Abstract = {Predicting the intentions of an observed agent and taking corresponding
   countermeasures is the essential part for the future proactive intrusion
   detection systems (IDS) as well as intrusion prevention systems (IPS).
   In this paper, an approach of dynamic Bayesian network with transfer
   probability estimation was developed to predict whether the goal of
   system call sequences is normal or not, with early-warnings being
   launched, so as to ensure that some appropriate countermeasures could be
   taken in advance. Since complete set of system call state transfer can
   hardly be built in real environments, the empirical results show that
   the newly emerging system call transfer would have great impact on the
   prediction performance if we straightly use dynamic Bayesian network
   without transfer probability estimation. Therefore, we estimate the
   probability of new state transfer to predict the goals of system call
   sequences together with those in conditional probability table (CPT). It
   surmounts the difficulties of manually selecting compensating parameters
   with dynamic Bayesian network approach {[}Feng L, Guan X, Guo S, Gao Y,
   Liu P. Predicting the intrusion intentions by observing system call
   sequences. Computers \& Security 2004; 23/3: 241-252] and obviously
   makes our prediction model more applicable. The University of New Mexico
   (UNM) and KLINNS data sets were analyzed and the experimental results
   show that it performs very well for predicting the goals of system call
   sequences with high accuracy and furthermore dispenses with much more
   manual work for selecting compensating parameters. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {Non-interference is a semantic program property that assigns
   confidentiality levels to data objects and prevents illicit information
   flows from occurring from high to low security levels. In this paper, we
   present a novel security model for global non-interference which
   approximates non-interference as a safety property. We also propose a
   certification technique for global non-interference of complete Java
   classes based on rewriting logic, a very general logical and semantic
   framework that is efficiently implemented in the high-level programming
   language Maude. Starting from an existing Java semantics specification
   written in Maude, we develop an extended, information-flow Java
   semantics that allows us to correctly observe global non-interference
   policies. In order to achieve a finite state transition system, we
   develop an abstract Java semantics that we use for secure and effective
   non-interference Java analysis. The analysis produces certificates that
   are independently checkable and are small enough to be used in practice.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel Optimization based corrective strategy based
   on graph theory to mitigate overloads during contingencies. Generator
   rescheduling and/or load shedding is performed locally, to restore the
   system from abnormal to normal operating state. The directed acyclic
   graph (DAG) technique is used to identify the participating generators
   and load buses for corrective control action with respect to a
   contingency. Particle warm optimization (PSO) is used to compute the
   optimal adjustments of generation and loads with security constraints
   such as line flows and bus,voltage limits. The effectiveness of the
   proposed approach is demonstrated for different contingency cases in
   IEEE 14- and 30-bus systems. The result shows that the proposed approach
   is computationally fast, reliable and efficient, in restoring the system
   to normal state after a contingency with minimal control actions.

Abstract = {The near field communication (NFC) is widely used on mobile devices and

   logic of events is a formal method to describe the protocol state

   efficiency of protocol analysis. We study the KerNeeS protocol which
   providing mutual authentication between POS and NFC phone, and conclude
   that the protocol can guarantee mutual authentication property between
   entities involved in the payment for secure payment transactions. The

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of active model discrimination
   amongst a finite number of affine models with uncontrolled and noise
   inputs, each representing a different system operating mode that
   corresponds to a fault type or an attack strategy, or to an unobserved
   intent of another robot, etc. The active model discrimination problem
   aims to find optimal separating inputs that guarantee that the outputs
   of all the affine models cannot be identical over a finite horizon. This
   will enable a system operator to detect and uniquely identify potential
   faults or attacks, despite the presence of process and measurement
   noise. Since the resulting model discrimination problem is a nonlinear
   non-convex mixed-integer program, we propose to solve this in a
   computationally tractable manner, albeit only approximately, by
   proposing a sequence of restrictions that guarantee that the obtained
   input is separating. Finally, we apply our approach to attack detection
   in the area of cyber-physical systems security. (C) 2017, IFAC

Abstract = {Traditional anti-counterfeit luminescent materials were limited by the
   fixed excitation and emission mode. Complex anti-counterfeiting
   strategies with multiple luminescent modes are significantly required
   for defeating the continuously developing counterfeit technologies. In
   this work, triplet-triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) materials
   were applied for anti-counterfeiting and encoding by combining with
   lanthanide-doped afterglow phosphors through an energy transfer process.
   This combination constructed a multi-mode luminescent system with four
   different luminescent modes, and the corresponding multi-dimensional
   anti-counterfeiting patterns were prepared by a direct-writing method. A
   dual polymer network matrix consisting of poly-alpha-pinene (P alpha P)
   and polyisobutylene (PIB) could protect TTA-UC from oxygen quenching and
   improve the printability of the system. Based on the four luminescent
   modes, multiple information could be obtained from the anti-counterfeit
   patterns and encoding arrays. This work provides a new perspective for
   designing multi-dimensional anti-counterfeiting and encoding methods
   with high information concealment and security.},

Abstract = {Increasingly throughout the world, interconnected power systems are
   collapsing following severe disturbances that have produced system
   voltage instability. In tackling this problem, simulations on a 92 bus
   network have studied the consequences of losing five lines
   simultaneously. With no countermeasures, the disturbance caused system
   voltage instability which culminated in its collapse. Following the same
   disturbance, a series of specific countermeasures was simulated. This
   arrangement of measures was able to restore the grid to a secure
   operating state, even with the five lines still out of service.
   By adopting an approach similar to underfrequency protection, measures,
   including load shedding, could be adopted to counter disturbances mom
   severe than those considered by planning criteria. This would
   considerably improve the resilience of interconnected power systems and
   by raising levels of operational security, they would be able to
   withstand disturbances which presently cause their collapse.},

Abstract = {With the advent of cloud computing in an era of mass data, more and more
   people are motivated to utilize the outsourcing service. For the sake of
   the security of the outsourced data, these data have to be encrypted
   prior to outsource to the remote ``honest-but-curious{''} servers. So
   far, the searchable encryption technique based on the secure index
   becomes a key and lead solution. Unfortunately, there exists no such
   solution focusing on the synonym search in the symmetric-key setting. In
   consideration of finiteness of people's memory and lifetime of people's
   knowledge, we seriously study this issue.
   In this paper, we design a scheme for the problem of synonym search, and
   provide the proof of security. Our proposed technique has a number of
   crucial advantages. We for the first time put forward the problem of the
   synonym keyword search over remotely encrypted data in the context of
   cloud computing. In our scheme, we introduce the concepts of synonym
   function and synonym sets. We firstly implement a formal practical
   Synonym Symmetric Searchable Encryption Solution (PSSSE). Through
   rigorous security analysis, we show that our proposed solution is
   correct and privacy-preserving (non-adaptive security) without the loss
   of function of the scheme. Besides, the algorithms we present are simple
   and effective, it almost increases no space and computing overhead of
   the user. The overhead of communication still remains O(1). The time
   complexity of searching on encryption data is O(p) (p denotes the
   maximum number of synonym of keyword). To apply to general situation, we
   simultaneously give a practical trade-off between availability and
   performance. This scheme greatly enhances system usability by responding
   the answers that are all documents containing keyword and corresponding
   synonyms. Its occurrence obviously overcomes the deficiency of existing
   schemes. Hence, our solution is very significative to practical use and
   bridges the gap of state-of-art.},

Abstract = {Real-time adaptive systems are complex systems capable to adapt their
   behavior to changing conditions in the environment, and/or internal
   state changes. Highly dynamic and possibly unpredictable environments,
   and uncertain operating conditions call for new paradigms of software
   design, and run-time adaptation mechanisms, to overcome the lack of
   knowledge at design time. Main application areas include vehicles or
   robots that need to collaborate to achieve a common task, e.g., minimize
   fuel consumption, moving objects at a construction site, or performing a
   set of operations in a factory. Moreover, these vehicles or robots need
   to interact and possibly collaborate with humans in a safe way, e.g.,
   avoiding accidents or collisions, and prevent hazardous situations that
   may harm humans and/or machines. This paper proposes a framework for
   developing safe and secure adaptive collaborative systems, with run-time
   guarantees. To enable this, our focus is on requirement engineering and
   safety assurance techniques to capture the specific safety and security
   properties for the collaborative system, and to provide an assurance
   case guaranteeing that the system is sufficiently safe. Moreover, the
   paper proposes an architecture and behavioral models to analyze the
   requirements at run-time. Finally, we design a suitable deployment
   platform to perform the run-time analysis and planning while
   guaranteeing the real-time constraints.},

Abstract = {At present, the robot is in a full swing state in various industries,
   and intelligent equipment can be seen everywhere. With the development
   of science and technology, the intelligence, reliability and functional

   of the robots sold in the existing market are service robots, domestic
   robots, and so on, while walking-assisted robots are few. Taking into
   account the above mentioned, this project is committed to the design and
   improvement of a lightweight walking-assisted skeletal robot which is
   composed of STM32 controller, sensor detection, feedback module, action
   module, mobile APP client and other units. It can identify the step
   width and pace to the STM32 data, through the gait and stability
   analysis, real-time adjustment of transmission device to drive the bone
   mechanical body, help the old man and the security of the disabled to
   walk. The system could be used for different operating modes of the
   pressure, acceleration, the heart rate and other non electrical

Abstract = {Video surveillance has become more and more important in many domains
   for their security and safety. Person Re-Identification (Re-ID) is one
   of the most interesting subjects in this area. The Re-ID system is
   divided into two main stages: i) extracting feature representations to
   construct a person's appearance signature and establishing the
   correspondence/matching by learning similarity metrics or ranking
   functions. However, appearance based person Re-ID is a challenging task
   due to similarity of human's appearance and visual ambiguities across
   different cameras. This paper provides a representation of the
   appearance descriptors, called signatures, for multi-shot Re-ID. First,
   we will present the tracklets, i.e trajectories of persons. Then, we
   compute the signature and represent it based on the approach of Part
   Appearance Mixture (PAM). An evaluation of the quality of this signature
   representation is also described in order to essentially solve the
   problems of high variance in a person's appearance, occlusions,
   illumination changes and person's orientation/pose. To deal with
   variance in a person's appearance, we represent it as a set of
   multi-modal feature distributions modeled by Gaussian Mixture Model
   (GMM). Experiments and results on two public datasets and on our own
   dataset show good performance.},

Abstract = {Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a critical and fundamental
   component of smart grids. Cyber security of AMI thus has direct
   implications to smart grid's secure and reliable operations. This paper
   establishes analytical models for studying AMI system's robustness with
   presence of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. This paper
   firstly proposes a state transition model for individual smart meter
   nodes and data collector nodes in an AMI communication network; based on
   this, a dynamic differential system is formulated to describe the
   network's state evolution. We analyze the dynamic differential system's
   stability under DDoS attacks and propose a defending strategy, which
   optimally allocate defending resources in the AMI network, aiming at
   mitigating the DDoS's threaten with minimum defending loss and cost.
   Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the proposed method
   under different AMI network topologies.},

Abstract = {Stimuli-responsive phosphorescence materials with dynamic color-changing
   properties are highly promising for advanced information security.
   Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy that effectively induces tunable
   dynamic phosphorescence color from carbon dots (CDs) on papers via
   surface ionization engineering for multimode encryption and information
   storage. Alkali-induced phenolic hydroxyl ionization on CDs can boost
   intersystem crossing rates, while surface-ionized groups with negative
   charges significantly passivate the surface defects and reduce
   non-radiative transitions, which can activate surface state-related blue
   phosphorescence emission. Combined with the carbon core state-related
   yellow green phosphorescence, excitation/time-dependent phosphorescence
   color-changing from yellow-green to blue are realized from alkali
   (Na2CO3) treated CDs on paper. Furthermore, benefiting from the
   transition from NaHCO3 to Na2CO3 under thermal treatment, dynamic
   color-changing phosphorescence can also be activated by thermally
   stimulating NaHCO3-treated CDs on paper. Finally, multi-stimuli (alkali
   or thermal) and multi-modal dynamic phosphorescent colors from a single
   CDs system are realized for the first time. Based on these unique
   features, multimode encryption and smart 3D codes with anti
   counterfeiting and monitoring functions for medicine during transport or
   storage are demonstrated by combining an inkjet printing technique using
   CD inks. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An emerging urban challenge will be the proliferation of Remotely
   Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) or drones, as their usage grows and
   drones fill the urban skies. Urban airspace will include many more
   Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and related accidents and mishaps
   will also increase. Applications of UAVs in urban environments include
   photography and film-making, security monitoring, real estate,
   construction, property and infrastructure inspections, leisure, public
   safety (fires, natural disasters, investigations), traffic, and much
   more. Emerging UAV applications include last-mile drone delivery
   services. This paper discusses urban scenarios where drones are more
   ubiquitous. Monitoring and related safety of these UAVs will be
   increasingly important. Though multi-modal purpose-built drone tracking
   and monitoring systems will be the most effective solution for detection
   and tracking of these RPAS, during the transition to more regular drone
   use in urban areas and in everyday urban applications, a more
   rapid-deployment and agile detection system is needed that does not
   require installation of hardware. In this paper, sensory substitution is
   presented as an approach to use ambient and pre-existing microphones and
   Al techniques to detect the presence of RPAS. Preliminary results show
   promise for this agile IoT method as a key solution to this emerging
   urban challenge.},

   The main obstacle for reliability evaluation in such a case is a ``curse

   using Lz-transform that drastically simplifies computation. The proposed
   approach is useful for power system security analysis and short-term
   operating decisions. In order to illustrate the proposed approach, the

Abstract = {Recently, user authentication has become more important as electronic
   items become part of the Internet of all Things and users own more
   mobile devices. Biometric authentication systems have made a promising
   stride toward reaching the balance of a strong and stress-free
   authentication by using the distinctiveness of the user's
   characteristics to determine valid users. Biometric authentication has
   gained popularity as the system for implicit, non-intrusive and
   progressive authentication because it has no memory load or carry-along
   requirements. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in facial biometrics
   research and we examine facial authentication techniques and the
   emerging usage of multi-modal biometrics such as various combinations of
   periocular, iris and face biometrics to ensure better user security. The
   miniaturization of advanced facial authentication hardware systems into
   mobile devices such as mobile phones and head-mounted displays (HMDs)
   used for VR/ AR/ MR has made biometric authentication seamless. Our
   survey examines facial authentication based on IR LED and multi-spectral
   cameras as they are the most commonly implemented hardware due to their
   multi-functional usage. We examine the possible application of these
   technologies within HMDs and the most recently released mobile phone
   devices on the market.},

Abstract = {Photonic networking technologies have the potential to revolutionise

   improvements in networking performance, reliability, cost and security.
   Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), in particular, can provide a
   huge bandwidth-to-weight ratio as well as enhanced routing flexibility,
   connectivity and network survivability. In this paper, the design and
   development of a multi-gigabit, broadband WDM network architecture,
   specifically designed for use in the aerospace environment, is
   discussed. A key element in the system is the arrayed-waveguide grating
   (AWG) wavelength multiplexing component, which has been designed to
   allow operation over the full military temperature specification (-55
   degreesC to +125 degreesC) without additional environmental
   conditioning. The paper describes the design of prototype AWG devices,
   which use multi-mode interference couplers to provide a flat spectral
   response, and presents preliminary results of their operation.},

Abstract = {Memory bugs are a broad class of bugs that is becoming increasingly
   common with increasing software complexity, and many of these bugs are
   also security vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, existing software and even
   hardware approaches for finding and identifying memory bugs have
   considerable performance overheads, target only a narrow class of bugs,
   are costly to implement, or use computational resources inefficiently.
   This paper describes MemTracker, a new hardware support mechanism that
   can be configured to perform different kinds of memory access monitoring
   tasks. MemTracker associates each word of data in memory with a few bits
   of state, and uses a programmable state transition table to react to
   different events that can affect this state. The number of state bits
   per word, the events to which MemTracker reacts, and the transition
   table are all fully programmable. MemTracker's rich set of states,
   events, and transitions can be used to implement different monitoring
   and debugging checkers with minimal performance overheads, even when
   frequent state updates are needed. To evaluate MemTracker, we map three
   different checkers onto it, as well as a checker that combines all
   three. For the most demanding (combined) checker, we observe performance
   overheads of only 2.7\% on average and 4.8\% worst-case on SPEC 2000
   applications. Such low overheads allow continuous (always-on) use of
   MemTracker-enabled checkers even in production runs.},

Abstract = {Role-based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the most widespread security
   mechanisms in use today. Given the growing complexity of policy
   languages and access control systems, verifying that such systems
   enforce the desired invariants is recognized as a security problem of
   crucial importance. In the present paper, we develop a framework for the
   formal verification of grsecurity, an access control system developed on
   top of Unix/Linux systems.
   The verification problem in grsecurity presents much of the complexity
   of modern RBAC systems, due to the presence of policy state changes that
   may arise both from explicit administrative primitives supported by
   grsecurity, and as the result of the interaction with the underlying
   operating system facilities. We develop a formal semantics for
   grsecurity's RBAC system, based on a labelled transition system, and a
   sound abstraction of that semantics providing a bounded approximation,
   amenable to model checking. We report on the result of the experimental
   analysis conducted with gran, the model checker we implemented based on
   our abstract semantics, on existing public servers running grsecurity to
   implement their RBAC systems.},

   network secrecy. In the energy harvesting phase, the PR transfers radio
   frequency energy to charge the source; then in the information
   transmission phase, the PR acts as a friendly jammer to protect the
   source transmission against eavesdropping. We study the dynamic energy
   state transitions at the source using an energy discretization method
   and a finite-state Markov chain. Closed-form expressions are derived for
   connection outage probability, secrecy outage probability, and effective
   secrecy throughput, with the aim to evaluate both reliability and
   security of the proposed protocol. Furthermore, numerical results reveal
   the impacts of various system parameters on the secrecy performance and
   demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed protocol over an
   existing scheme.},

Abstract = {We present a new general framework for constructing compact and
   adaptively secure attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes from k-Lin in
   asymmetric bilinear pairing groups. Previously, the only construction
   {[}Kowalczyk and Wee, Eurocrypt `19] that simultaneously achieves
   compactness and adaptive security from static assumptions supports
   policies represented by Boolean formulae. Our framework enables
   supporting more expressive policies represented by arithmetic branching
   programs.
   Our framework extends to ABE for policies represented by uniform models
   of computation such as Turing machines. Such policies enjoy the feature
   of being applicable to attributes of arbitrary lengths. We obtain the
   first compact adaptively secure ABE for deterministic and
   non-deterministic finite automata (DFA and NFA) from k-Lin, previously
   unknown from any static assumptions. Beyond finite automata, we obtain
   the first ABE for large classes of uniform computation, captured by
   deterministic and non-deterministic logspace Turing machines (the
   complexity classes L and NL) based on k-Lin. Our ABE scheme has compact
   secret keys of size linear in the description size of the Turing machine
   M. The ciphertext size grows linearly in the input length, but also
   linearly in the time complexity, and exponentially in the space
   complexity. Irrespective of compactness, we stress that our scheme is
   the first that supports large classes of Turing machines based solely on
   standard assumptions. In comparison, previous ABE for general Turing
   machines all rely on strong primitives related to indistinguishability
   obfuscation.},

Abstract = {With the increasingly fierce competition for electromagnetic spectrum
   resources and the rapid development in artificial intelligence,
   frequency-hopping (FH) communication systems are facing serious
   intelligent jamming attacks. Under this background, game theory has
   become an effective tool to solve the optimal decision-making problem in
   communication countermeasures. In this paper, focusing on defending
   against sweep jamming attacks and considering the inevitable
   transmission delay of an actual communication system, we propose a
   multi-step prediction Markov decision process (MPMDP) and set up a
   multi-step prediction Bellman iterative equation (MPBIE). To solve the
   MPBIE, multi-step state transition probabilities are derived, and a
   simplified algorithm is designed. Combing the complete strategy we
   proposed, the MPMDP strategy to maximize the utility of the FH
   communication system is obtained. With the assumption that the jammer
   can learn the MPMDP strategy of the FH communication system, we
   furtherly study its optional sweep jamming attack strategy. The MPMDP
   strategy and the optional intelligent sweep jamming attack strategy as a
   Nash equilibrium of the communication system and the jammer are proved.
   Lastly, simulation results show that the property and theorems proposed
   in this paper are valid, and our MPMDP strategy outperforms similar
   algorithms in terms of the applicable range and performance.},

Title = {A Novel Prediction Approach for Short-Term Renewable Energy Consumption
   in China Based on Improved Gaussian Process Regression},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Energy consumption issues are important factors concerning the
   achievement of sustainable social development and also have a
   significant impact on energy security, particularly for China whose
   energy structure is experiencing a transformation. Construction of an
   accurate and reliable prediction model for the volatility changes in
   energy consumption can provide valuable reference information for policy
   makers of the government and for the energy industry. In view of this, a
   novel improved model is developed in this article by integrating the
   modified state transition algorithm (MSTA) with the Gaussian processes
   regression (GPR) approach for non-fossil energy consumption predictions
   for China at the end of the 13th Five-Year Project, in which the MSTA is
   utilized for effective optimization of hyper-parameters in GPR. Aiming
   for validating the superiority of MSTA, several comparisons are
   conducted on two well-known functions and the optimization results show
   the effectiveness of modification in the state transition algorithm
   (STA). Then, based on the latest statistical renewable energy
   consumption data, the MSTA-GPR model is utilized to generate consumption
   predictions for overall renewable energy and each single renewable
   energy source, including hydropower, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass
   and other energies, respectively. The forecasting results reveal that
   the proposed improved GPR can promote the forecasting ability of basic
   GPR and obtain the best prediction effect among all the other comparison
   models. Finally, combined with the forecasting results, the trend of
   each renewable energy source is analyzed.},

Abstract = {Multi-Client Functional Encryption (MCFE) and MultiInput Functional
   Encryption (MIFE) are very interesting extensions of Functional
   Encryption for practical purpose. They allow to compute joint function
   over data from multiple parties. Both primitives are aimed at
   applications in multi-user settings where decryption can be correctly
   output for users with appropriate functional decryption keys only. While
   the definitions for a single user or multiple users were quite general
   and can be realized for general classes of functions as expressive as
   Turing machines or all circuits, efficient schemes have been proposed so
   far for concrete classes of functions: either only for access control,
   i.e. the identity function under some conditions, or linear/quadratic
   functions under no condition. In this paper, we target classes of
   functions that explicitly combine some evaluation functions independent
   of the decrypting user under the condition of some access control. More
   precisely, we introduce a framework for MCFE with fine-grained access
   control and propose constructions for both single-client and
   multi-client settings, for inner-product evaluation and access control
   via Linear Secret Sharing Schemes (LSSS), with selective and adaptive
   security. The only known work that combines functional encryption in
   multi-user setting with access control was proposed by Abdalla et al.
   (Asiacrypt `20), which relies on a generic transformation from the
   single-client schemes to obtain MIFE schemes that suffer a quadratic
   factor of n (where n denotes the number of clients) in the ciphertext
   size. We follow a different path, via MCFE: we present a
   duplicate-and-compress technique to transform the single-client scheme
   and obtain a MCFE with fine-grained access control scheme with only a
   linear factor of n in the ciphertext size. Our final scheme thus
   outperforms the Abdalla et al.'s scheme by a factor n, as one can obtain
   MIFE from MCFE by making all the labels in MCFE a fixed public constant.
   The concrete constructions are secure under the SXDH assumption, in the
   random oracle model for the MCFE scheme, but in the standard model for
   the MIFE improvement.},

Abstract = {State-of-the-art unmanned ground vehicles are capable of understanding
   and adapting to arbitrary road terrain for navigation. The robotic
   mobility platforms mounted, with sensors detect and report security
   concerns for subsequent action. Often, the information based on the
   localization of the unmanned vehicle is not sufficient for deploying
   army resources. In such a scenario, a three dimensional (3D) map of the
   area that the ground vehicle has surveyed in its trajectory would
   provide apriori spatial knowledge for directing resources in an
   efficient manner. To that end, we propose a mobile, modular imaging
   system that incorporates multi-modal sensors for mapping unstructured
   arbitrary terrain. Our proposed system leverages 3D laser-range sensors,
   video cameras, global positioning systems (GPS) and inertial measurement
   units (IMU) towards the generation of photo-realistic, geometrically
   accurate, geo-referenced 3D terrain models. Based on the summary of the
   state-of-the-art systems, we address the need and hence several
   challenges in the real-time deployment, integration and visualization of
   data from multiple sensors. We document design issues concerning each of
   these sensors and present a simple temporal alignment method to
   integrate multi-sensor data into textured 3D models. These 3D models, in
   addition to serving as apriori for path planning, can also be used in
   simulators that study vehicle-terrain interaction. Furthermore, we show
   our 3D models possessing the required accuracy even for crack detection
   towards road surface inspection in airfields and highways.},

Abstract = {Miniature circuit breaker (MCB) is an electrical protection equipment.
   Generally it is used in households as an over current circuit breaker to
   ensure safety from electrical hazards like outrageous fire accidents
   arising from electrical short circuit. These kinds of electrical hazards
   occur because the amperage of these circuit breakers are fixed and we
   cannot change the tripping current anytime to endure the newly added or
   removed electrical loads. This paper reports the experimental
   realization of a numerical overcurrent relay using, primarily, a
   microcontroller and a micro current transformer (CT) which is compatible
   with smart grid technology and high voltage system like electric
   vehicle. In this newly designed numerical over current relay (NOCR) the
   user can change the set current and the sensitivity of the system just
   by twisting two different knobs. Thus this system ensures advance
   security against electrical hazards than a normal MCB. It will obtain,
   trial and covert analog current signals hooked on digital form of a
   power system in real time. Solid state switch (MOSFET switch) has been
   opted as circuit breaker in order to enhance system effectivity. This
   newly designed system can detect a fault or over current with 100\%
   accuracy and the operating time (OT) calculated by this relay is 99.57\%
   responsive to the theoretical calculation. All the components used to
   assemble this system are off the shelf; hence engender an economic and
   portable over current relay than any other commercially available
   system.},

Abstract = {The existing identity authentication of IoT devices mostly depends on an
   intermediary institution, i.e., a CA server, which suffers from the
   single-point-failure attack. Even worse, the critical data of
   authenticated devices can be tampered by inner attacks without being
   identified. To address these issues, we utilize blockchain technology,
   which serves as a secure tamper-proof distributed ledger to IoT devices.
   In the proposed method, we assign a unique ID for each individual device
   and record them into the blockchain, so that they can authenticate each
   other without a central authority. We also design a data protection
   mechanism by hashing significant data (i.e. firmware) into the
   blockchain where any state changes of the data can be detected
   immediately. Finally, we implement a prototype based on an open source
   blockchain platform Hyperledger Fabric to verify the proposed system.},

Abstract = {The continued growth of both wired and wireless communications has
   triggered the revolution for the generation of new cryptographic
   algorithms. SHA-2 hash family is a new standard in the widely used hash
   functions category. An architecture and the VLSI implementation of this
   standard are proposed in this work. The proposed architecture Supports a
   multi-mode operation in the sense that it performs all the three hash
   functions (256, 384 and 512) of the SHA-2 standard. The proposed system
   is compared with the implementation of each hash function in a separate
   FPGA device. Comparing with previous designs, the introduced system can
   work in higher operation frequency and needs less silicon area
   resources. The achieved performance in the term of throughput of the
   proposed system/architecture is much higher (in a range from 277 to
   417\%) than the other hardware implementations. The introduced
   architecture also performs Much better than the implementations of the
   existing standard SHA-1, and also offers a higher security level
   strength. The proposed system could be used for the implementation of
   integrity units, and in many other sensitive cryptographic applications,
   such as, digital signatures, message authentication codes and random
   number generators.},

Abstract = {Frequency deviation and voltage fluctuation are two major concerns in
   planning and security assessment of power systems. This paper presents a
   novel electric vehicle (EV) intelligent integrated station (IIS) concept
   to provide frequency and voltage control ancillary services to the grid.
   The IIS can be operated in normal, protective, and isolated modes,
   considering the operating states of the grid. The concept of generalized
   energy is applied in responding to the actual losses in the
   charging/discharging process in order to study the power/energy flow. By
   making the full use of battery storage system in the IIS, the proposed
   active power-frequency control and the reactive power-voltage control
   can strengthen the grid stability under normal operation conditions.
   Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed frequency/voltage control approaches in a selected distribution
   network. Results imply that the IIS can mitigate the frequency deviation
   and voltage fluctuations of the grid.},

Abstract = {Autonomous Sensor Networks have the potential for broad applicability to
   national security, intelligent transportation, industrial production and
   environmental and hazardous process control. Distributed sensors may be
   used for detecting bio-terrorist attacks, for contraband interdiction,
   border patrol, monitoring building safety and security, battlefield
   surveillance, or may be embedded in complex dynamic systems for enabling
   fault tolerant operations. In this paper we present algorithms and
   automation tools for constructing discrete event controllers for complex
   networked systems that restrict the dynamic behavior of the system
   according to given specifications. In our previous work we have modeled
   dynamic system as a discrete event automaton whose open loop behavior is
   represented as a language L of strings generated with the alphabet Sigma
   of all possible atomic events that cause state transitions in the
   network. The controlled behavior is represented by a sublanguage K,
   contained in L, that restricts the behavior of the system according to
   the specifications of the controller. We have developed the algebraic
   structure of controllable sublanguages as perfect right partial ideals
   that satisfy a precontrollability condition.(1) In this paper we develop
   an iterative algorithm to take an ad hoc specification described using a
   natural language, and to formulate a complete specification that results
   in a controllable sublanguage. A supervisory controller modeled as an
   automaton that runs synchronously with the open loop system in the sense
   of Ramadge and Wonham(2) is automatically generated to restrict the
   behavior of the open loop system to the controllable sublanguage.
   A battlefield surveillance scenario illustrates the iterative evolution
   of ad hoc specifications for controlling an autonomous sensor network
   and the generation of a controller that reconfigures the sensor network
   to dynamically adapt to environmental perturbations.},

Abstract = {The notion of smooth projective hash functions was proposed by Cramer
   and Shoup and can be seen as special type of zero-knowledge proof system
   for a language. Though originally used as a means to build efficient
   chosen-ciphertext secure public-key encryption schemes; some variations
   of the Crainer-Shoup smooth projective hash functions also found
   applications in several other contexts, such as password-based
   authenticated key exchange and oblivious transfer. In this paper, we
   first; address the problem of building smooth projective hash functions
   for more complex languages. Adore precisely, we show how to build such
   functions for languages that can be described in terms of disfunctions
   and conjunctions of simpler languages for which smooth projective hash
   functions are known to exist. Next, we illustrate how the use of smooth
   projective hash functions with more complex languages can be efficiently
   associated to extractable commitment schemes and avoid the need for
   zero-knowledge proofs. Finally, we explain flow to apply these results
   to provide more efficient solutions to two well-known cryptographic
   problems: a public-key certification which guarantees the knowledge of
   the private key by the user without random oracles or zero-knowledge
   proofs and adaptive security for password-based authenticated key
   exchange protocols in the universal composability framework with
   erasures.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {8},
Pages = {222274-222284},
Abstract = {Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) have increasing demand to improve safety and
   reliability of air compressors with various fault diagnosis methods.
   Fault diagnosis methods may provide early fault warning information for
   air compressors rapidly and give a reference for maintenance, especially
   for the serious faults affecting security strongly. In this work, a
   method framework of fault diagnosis system based on the Vibration
   Observation Window (VOW) for air compressors is proposed. The VOW
   constructs a dynamic vibration tensor which presents the operating state
   of air compressors according to the real time vibration data,
   strengthens the association among the monitoring data in spatial domain
   and time domain. Thus, dynamic characteristic, which reflects the fault
   information, can be contained in the dynamic vibration tensor
   explicitly. For proving the advantage of VOW method, we compare the
   performance between the fault diagnosis system with VOW and the fault
   diagnosis system without VOW based on different hardware environments:
   embedded computer, and high speed Industrial PC. The results show that
   the VOW method can both improve the performance of the vibration fault
   diagnosis system of NPPs in different hardware environments.},

Abstract = {Where customers with different membership and position, use computers as
   in the university network systems, it often takes much time and efforts
   for them to cope with the change of the system management. This is
   because the requirements for the respective computer usage are different
   in the network and security policies. In this paper, destination
   addressing control system scheme (DACS Scheme) for the university
   network services is shown. The DACS Scheme performs network management
   efficiently through the communication management of a client. As the
   characteristic of DACS Scheme, only the setup modification is required
   by a system administrator, when configuration change of the network
   system is performed. Then, the setup modification is unnecessary by a
   customer, which shows a merit for both a system administrator and a
   customer. However, there is a problem to be solved. In existing DACS
   Scheme, it is promised that, DACS Client for controlling the
   communication must be implemented on all clients. When the client not
   installing DACS Client is connected to the network, each network server
   can be accessed from the client. Therefore, in this paper, secure DACS
   Scheme with function to prevent the communication from the client not
   installing DACS Client, is proposed and examined.},

Abstract = {Across the globe, billions of dollars are spending every year to provide
   security to the network systems to prevent the intrusions. Some consider
   the disruption of the vital systems as a serious threat which disables
   the work of hospitals, banks, military and various internet services
   across the world. To avert this impending threat, there are many
   possible solutions: one of these solutions is intrusion detection
   systems (IDS). The paper proposes to discuss the IDS model in its
   elaboration using Bayesian Network and the Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
   approach with KDDCUP dataset. The IDS framework has been designed with
   various levels of processing such as model learning with training data
   and constructing the Bayesian Network and this structure has been used
   as HMM state transition diagram. The preprocessed KDDCUP dataset has
   been used to train and test the model. The IDS model has been trained
   and tested for normal and attack type connection records separately. The
   results evince that the performance of the model is of high order for
   classification of normal and intrusions attacks. (C) 2011 Published by

Title = {TinyLedger: A Lightweight Blockchain Ledger Protocol for the MEC
   Network{*}},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {109},
Number = {B},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {With the development of the Internet of Things, multi-access edge
   computing (MEC) is widely used in industrial IoT, intelligent transport
   systems, and IoT data management. As a decentralized, tamper-proof,
   multiparty trusted ledger technology, blockchain can enhance MEC
   security, privacy, and automatic use of resources. However, highly
   redundant storage and complex consensus prevent the blockchain from
   being directly deployed to edge computing nodes with limited resources.
   Unlike existing lightweight schemes, which do not consider liberating
   transaction data from blocks, this paper proposes a lightweight
   blockchain ledger protocol for MEC networks. The novelty of this work is
   that the transaction data in the block is compressed into a succinct
   proof through the zero-knowledge proof algorithm. To reduce the storage
   of block data, this paper proposes the proof-of-state-transfer model in
   which nodes verify the correctness of the global state transfer in the
   block without transactions. To reduce the communication complexity of
   consensus, this paper proposes a lightweight consensus protocol, which
   reduces the communication complexity of block voting and view switching
   to O(n). This paper develops the prototype system of TinyLedger to
   experiment and evaluate the performance of the system in terms of
   storage, verification, throughput, and communication. Experimental
   results show that compared to Ethereum, TinyLedger reduces storage
   capacity by 98.16\%, communication volume by 74.53\%, and block
   verification time by 87\%.},

Abstract = {Increasingly many systems have to run all the time with no downtime
   allowed. Consider, for example, systems controlling electric power
   plants and e-banking servers. Nevertheless, security patches and a
   constant stream of new operating system versions need to be deployed
   without stopping running programs. These factors naturally lead to a
   pressing demand for live update-upgrading all or parts of the operating
   system without rebooting. Unfortunately, existing solutions require
   significant manual intervention and thus work reliably only for small
   operating system patches.
   In this paper, we describe an automated system for live update that can
   safely and automatically handle major upgrades without rebooting. We
   have implemented our ideas in PROTEOS, a new research OS designed with
   live update in mind. PROTEOS relies on system support and nonintrusive
   instrumentation to handle even very complex updates with minimal manual
   effort. The key novelty is the idea of state quiescence, which allows
   updates to happen only in safe and predictable system states. A second
   novelty is the ability to automatically perform transactional live
   updates at the process level, ensuring a safe and stable update process.
   Unlike prior solutions, PROTEOS supports automated state transfer, state
   checking, and hot rollback. We have evaluated PROTEOS on 50 real updates
   and on novel live update scenarios. The results show that our techniques
   can effectively support both simple and complex updates, while
   outperforming prior solutions in terms of flexibility, security,
   reliability, and stability of the update process.},

Abstract = {Erasable memory is an important resource for designing practical
   cryptographic protocols that are secure against adaptive attacks. Many
   practical memory devices such as solid state drives, hard disks, or file
   systems are not perfectly erasable because a deletion operation leaves
   traces of the deleted data in the system. A number of methods for
   constructing a large erasable memory from a small one, e.g., using
   encryption, have been proposed. Despite the importance of erasable
   memory in cryptography, no formal model has been proposed that allows
   one to formally analyse such memory constructions or cryptographic
   protocols relying on erasable memory.
   The contribution of this paper is three-fold. First, we provide a formal
   model of erasable memory. A memory device allows a user to store,
   retrieve, and delete data, and it is characterised by a leakage function
   defining the extent to which erased data is still accessible to an
   adversary.
   Second, we investigate how the erasability of such memories can be
   amplified. We provide a number of constructions of memories with strong
   erasability guarantees from memories with weaker guarantees. One of
   these constructions of perfectly erasable memories from imperfectly
   erasable ones can be considered as the prototypical application of
   Canetti et al. `s All-or-Nothing Transform (AoNT). Motivated by this
   construction, we propose some new and better AoNTs that are either
   perfectly or computationally secure. These AoNTs are of possible
   independent interest.
   Third, we show (in the constructive cryptography framework) how the
   construction of erasable memory and its use in cryptographic protocols
   (for example to achieve adaptive security) can naturally be composed to
   obtain provable security of the overall protocol.},

Title = {A Non-Destructive Method for Hardware Trojan Detection Based on Radio
   Frequency Fingerprinting},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Hardware Trojans (HTs) pose a security threat to the Internet of Things
   (IoT). Attackers can take control of devices in IoT through HTs, which
   seriously jeopardize the security of many systems in transportation,
   finance, healthcare, etc. Since subtle differences in the circuit are
   reflected in far-field signals emitted by the system, the detection of
   HT status can be performed by monitoring the radio frequency
   fingerprinting (RFF) of the transmitting signals. For the detection of
   HTs, a non-destructive detection method based on RFF is proposed in this
   paper. Based on the proposed method, the detection of HTs can be
   achieved without integrating additional devices in the receiver, which
   reduces associated costs and energy consumption. QPSK and
   triangular-wave signals are measured and identified via experimentation,
   and the results validate the proposed method. For identifying the
   presence and operating state of Trojan, the average accuracy achieved
   measures as high as 98.7\%. Notably, with regard to capturing the moment
   of Trojan activation in the AES encryption circuit, the accuracy of the
   proposed method is 100\% and can provide warning of the threat in a
   timely manner.},

Abstract = {One ultimate goal of power network planning is to construct power
   systems that are environmentally friendly. However, it is still a
   challenging issue to efficiently consider environmental factors in power
   network planning problems due to the complexity and the diversity of
   environment. This paper presents a nonlinear approach to formulate the
   multi-dimensional spatial power network planning problem based on raster
   map in geographic information systems. With the objective of minimizing
   investment and operation costs, the proposed model integrates five
   dimensions: the substation location, the substation sizing, the line
   type selection, the optimal electric line routing, and the power network
   evaluation in terms of the ac power flow calculation. Furthermore, the
   branch capacity constraints and the node voltage limitations at peak
   load hours are examined to ensure the operational security of power
   systems. To overcome difficulties in solving the mixed-integer nonlinear
   optimization problem, an enhanced ant colony optimization with the
   four-search-space structure and the improved state transition rule is
   introduced. The case results validate the proposed model and the
   algorithms. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION},
Year = {2009},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Memory bugs are a broad class of bugs that is becoming increasingly
   common with increasing software complexity, and many of these bugs are
   also security vulnerabilities. Existing software and hardware approaches
   for finding and identifying memory bugs have a number of drawbacks
   including considerable performance overheads, target only a specific
   type of bug, implementation cost, and inefficient use of computational
   resources.
   This article describes MemTracker, a new hardware support mechanism that
   can be configured to perform different kinds of memory access monitoring
   tasks. MemTracker associates each word of data in memory with a few bits
   of state, and uses a programmable state transition table to react to
   different events that can affect this state. The number of state bits
   per word, the events to which MemTracker reacts, and the transition
   table are all fully programmable. MemTracker's rich set of states,
   events, and transitions can be used to implement different monitoring
   and debugging checkers with minimal performance overheads, even when
   frequent state updates are needed. To evaluate MemTracker, we map three
   different checkers onto it, as well as a checker that combines all
   three. For the most demanding ( combined) checker with 8 bits state per
   memory word, we observe performance overheads of only around 3\%, on
   average, and 14.5\% worst-case across different benchmark suites. Such
   low overheads allow continuous (always-on) use of MemTracker-enabled
   checkers, even in production runs.},

   security challenges faced by the 5G radio access network (5G-RAN)
   control plane as a result of the functional and architectural
   enhancements made at the radio resource control (RRC) protocol layer. We
   correspondingly analyze the dynamics of the new 5G RRC three-states
   model for a machine-type traffic pattern under an attack-free situation.
   Afterwards, we introduce and describe two RRC-based denial of service
   (DoS) attacks threatening the 5G-RAN resources availability. In the
   first threat scenario, the attacker maliciously manipulates the timing
   of state transitions in an attempt to overload the control plane. The
   second attack can be carried out through faking huge on-demand system
   information requests to prevent legitimate consumers from access to the
   cell and cause failed and interrupted 5G mobile services. Through
   numerical simulations, we measure the potential impact of these attacks
   on both 5G devices using the collision probability along with the access
   delay metrics, and on the critical gNB-centralized unit using the
   signaling overhead and the resource occupancy time metrics. Our
   observations reveal that both attacks can have disastrous effects on
   network stability and resiliency. Finally, some promising solutions are
   listed, with a special emphasis on injecting randomness into system
   parameters to complicate the task of designing such DoS attacks.},

Abstract = {Initiatives such as smart mobility and automated driving bring new
   concerns such as safety and security for the automotive industry. New
   architecture and designs are required for the in-vehicle systems to
   address these emerging concerns. Early design decisions have a large
   impact on the required functionalities as well as the quality attributes
   of these systems. Understanding the impact of design decisions on the
   system quality is crucial for successful system development. It is
   difficult to estimate the requirements for safety (at an early
   development stage) considering the innovation aspect of automated
   driving. These safety requirements have a considerable influence on
   project planning and development cost. Therefore, it is important for
   the industry to understand the decision points and their impact on
   system design. In this article, we share our experience on understanding
   the impact of early design decisions on safety requirements. We
   particularly discuss the impact of design decisions regarding the
   operational design domain on (functional) safety. We provide two
   automated driving systems as discussion cases and investigate the impact
   of the operational situation on the safety requirements such as safe
   state and degraded operating mode. We show how posting small constraints
   on the operational situation can result in simplification of the sensor
   and actuator requirements of these systems.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a two-stage combined central and distributed
   Volt/Var control (VVC) strategy to coordinate both utility-scale and
   customer-owned photovoltaics (PVs) for voltage regulation in active
   distribution networks (ADN). In the first stage, with day-ahead PV and
   load predictions, the central controller (CC) performs optimal power
   flow (OPF) to determine the hourly dispatch of on-load tap changers
   (OLTC) and capacitor banks (CBs). In the second stage, the ADN is
   partitioned into different zones only based on PV and load types. The
   zone controllers (ZC), which is formulated by deep neural networks
   (DNN), then communicate with their neighbors and track the optimal total
   reactive power support of PVs in each zone. In the offline training
   process, an analytical derivation to minimize power losses is also
   provided that can help the input and output selection of DNN. To online
   dispatch reactive power for individual utility-scale and customer-owned
   PVs in corresponding zones, a multi-mode reactive power allocation
   strategy is proposed. Three different modes namely loss reduction mode
   (LRM), fair power sharing mode (FPM) and voltage security mode (VSM) are
   designed to meet varying operation requirements, which can mitigate
   voltage violations with fair participation for customers and reduced
   power losses for system operators. Numerical simulations are performed
   on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system to demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed method in finding a trade-off between voltage security
   and loss minimization with fairness.},

Abstract = {When customers with different membership and position use computers as
   in the university network systems, it often takes much time and efforts
   for them to cope with the change of the system management. This is
   because the requirements for the respective computer usage are different
   in the network and security policies. In this paper, a new destination
   addressing control system scheme (DACS Scheme) for the university
   network services is shown. The DACS Scheme performs the network services
   efficiently through the communication management of a client. As the
   characteristic of DACS Scheme, only the setup modification is required
   by a system administrator, when the configuration change is needed in
   the network server. Then, the setup modification is unnecessary by a
   customer, which shows a merit for both a system administrator and a
   customer. However, there is a problem to be solved. In existing DACS
   Scheme, it is assumed that DACS Client for controlling the communication
   must be implemented on all clients. If the client without DACS Client is
   connected to the network, each network server can be accessed from the
   client. Therefore, in this paper, secure DACS Scheme with the function
   to prevent the communication from the client without DACS Client is
   proposed and examined. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach for composite risk management of
   rail operations incorporating operational risk computed by the rail
   industry and cyber security risk introduced due to Positive Train
   Control (PTC). The suggested risk model focuses on a given train
   location to estimate likelihood of the PTC system failing by considering
   environmental risk factors (precipitation, vegetation, obstacles) and
   the inherent vulnerability of the radio frequency yielding a measure of
   system impact. For the same location, the risk model considers safety
   related attributes such as train speed, track curvature, freight type,
   etc. offering an estimate of operational consequence if there were an
   accident due to the failure of PTC. It is this intersection of impact /
   consequence that separates the proposed model from existing risk
   calculations of impact / likelihood. This is accomplished by
   distinguishing the likelihood of a safety accident from the likelihood
   of a PTC system failure and incorporating them both. What results is an
   enhancement of both models; the operational risk model factors potential
   PTC failure in its risk assessment and gains awareness of possible
   requirements for operator intervention while the system risk model
   factors operational risk as its severity metric leading to possible
   requirements for automated risk mitigation by dynamic configuration
   change to the PTC radio.},

Abstract = {Complex chemical process has the characteristics of nonlinear and

   (LLE) compound statistic fault detection method based on Gaussian
   weighted adaptive selection k-nearest neighbor. First, the K nearest
   neighbors (KNN) in the LLE algorithm are selected adaptively by the
   Gaussian weighted KNN algorithm. Then, the low dimensional sub-epidemic
   of high dimensional data is extracted by the LLE algorithm, and the
   mapping matrix from highdimensional data to low-dimensional data is
   obtained by local linear regression. In addition, a compound statistic
   is proposed to complement the T2 and SPE statistics to ensure a
   satisfying detection effect. Finally, the simulation of
   Tennessean-Eastman (TE) chemical data is carried out and compared with
   the classical detection method to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm.},

Abstract = {Template security of biometric systems is a vital issue and needs
   critical focus. The importance lies in the fact that unlike passwords,
   stolen biometric templates cannot be revoked. Hence, the biometric
   templates cannot be stored in plain format and needs strong protection
   against any forgery. In this paper, we present a technique to generate
   face and palm vein-based fuzzy vault for multi-biometric cryptosystem.
   Here, initially the input images are pre-processed using various
   processes to make images fit for further processing. In our proposed
   method, the features are extracted from the processed hand and palm vein
   images by finding out unique common points. The chaff points are added
   to the already extracted points to obtain the combined feature vector.
   The secret key points which are generated based on the user key input
   (by using proposed method) are added to the combined feature vector to
   have the fuzzy vault. For decoding, the multi-modal biometric template
   from palm vein and hand vein image is constructed and is combined with
   the stored fuzzy vault to generate the final key. Finally, the
   experimentation is conducted using the palm vein and hand vein database.
   The evaluation metrics employed are FMR (False Match Ratio) and GMR
   (Genuine Match Ratio). From the metric values obtained for the proposed
   system, we can infer that the system has performed well. The results are
   also compared to our earlier technique and the results shows that the
   proposed technique has achieved better results having GAR of 94\%
   without noise and 88\% with noise.},

Abstract = {Privacy protection in computer communication is gaining attention
   because plaintext transmission without encryption can be eavesdropped on
   and intercepted. Accordingly, the use of encrypted communication
   protocols is on the rise, along with the number of cyberattacks
   exploiting them. Decryption is essential for preventing attacks, but it
   risks privacy infringement and incurs additional costs. Network
   fingerprinting techniques are among the best alternatives, but existing
   techniques are based on information from the TCP/IP stack. They are
   expected to be less effective because cloud-based and software-defined
   networks have ambiguous boundaries, and network configurations not
   dependent on existing IP address schemes increase. Herein, we
   investigate and analyze the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   fingerprinting technique, a technology that can analyze and classify
   encrypted traffic without decryption while addressing the problems of
   existing network fingerprinting techniques. Background knowledge and
   analysis information for each TLS fingerprinting technique is presented
   herein. We discuss the pros and cons of two groups of techniques,
   fingerprint collection and artificial intelligence (AI)-based. Regarding
   fingerprint collection techniques, separate discussions on handshake
   messages ClientHello/ServerHello, statistics of handshake state
   transitions, and client responses are provided. For AI-based techniques,
   discussions on statistical, time series, and graph techniques according
   to feature engineering are presented. In addition, we discuss hybrid and
   miscellaneous techniques that combine fingerprint collection with AI
   techniques. Based on these discussions, we identify the need for a
   step-by-step analysis and control study of cryptographic traffic to
   effectively use each technique and present a blueprint.},

Abstract = {With the extensive application of DC power systems, suppression of DC
   fault current is an important subject that guarantees system security.
   This paper presents an active superconducting DC fault current limiter
   (DC-SFCL) based on flux compensation. The DC-SFCL is composed of two
   superconducting windings wound on a single iron core, the primary
   winding is in series with DC power system, and the second winding is
   connected with AC power system through a PWM converter. In normal
   operating state, the flux in the iron core is compensated to zero, and
   the SFCL has no influence on DC power system. In the case of DC system
   accident, through regulating the active power exchange between the
   SFCL's second winding and the AC power system, the current on the DC
   side can be limited to different level complying with the system demand.
   Moreover, the PWM converter that interface the DC system and AC system
   can be controlled as a reactive power source to supply voltage support
   for the AC side, which has little influence on the performance of SFCL.
   Using MATLAB SIMULINK, the mathernatic model of the DC-SFCL is created,
   simulation results validate the dynamics of system, and the performance
   of DC-SFCL is confirmed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {To accommodate a higher penetration of distributed energy resources,
   distribution systems are moving toward hybrid AC/DC configurations for
   secure and economic operation. In this regard, this paper proposes a
   forecasting-aided state estimator (FASE) for hybrid AC/DC distribution
   systems to obtain accurate estimates for online security monitoring and
   control. The proposed FASE is designed in a distributed framework, with
   decomposition into several subproblems and solution by a constrained
   ensemble Kalman filter algorithm. In the proposed methodology, a deep
   neural network-based state forecasting model is developed to imitate the
   complex temporal and spatial relationship between system states,
   avoiding the state transition model built by unfounded explicit
   formulations. Furthermore, smart meter data is integrated by deep
   regression learning to obtain power injections of consumers and address
   the system observability issue. Extensive comparisons with two
   alternatives are carried out on a sample 33-node hybrid AC/DC
   distribution system to show the effectiveness and benefits of the
   proposed FASE, and on a larger 106-node hybrid AC/DC distribution system
   to demonstrate scalability.},

Abstract = {Multi-stage collusive attack (MSCA) covers a large class of attack
   variants, and commonly refers to an attack consists of several atomic
   attack stages and is enforced by a number of coordinated attack parties.
   The rich history of the development of countermeasures for specific
   MSCA, e.g., DDoS, worms, has shown that it is the special
   spatio-temporal characteristic that causes the prevention, detection and
   response of MSCA to be challenging. Instead of focusing on fine-grained
   specific attack analysis, this paper presents a model from high-level
   viewpoint, aiming at characterizing the behaviors of MSCA in terms of
   key spatio-temporal properties for better understanding and more
   effective design of countermeasures. The model is specifically developed
   for two purposes: First, it sheds light on the fundamental elements of
   an MSCA by examining its spatio-temporal related observations, and
   formulating attacker behavior as a reward-directed Markov decision
   process; Second, it assists security administrator in identifying the
   potential causal relationship of system vulnerabilities based on the
   reports of deployed security tools, so as to suggest appropriate
   actions. Taking the model as a basis, two meta-heuristic algorithms are
   designed. Specifically, attackers nondeterministic trail search (ANTS)
   is developed for approximately searching attack schemes with the minimum
   attack cost, and attacker's pivots discovery via backward searching
   (APD-BS) is designed for examining the pivots of attack schemes, namely
   the key observations associated with system state transitions during an
   attack. Finally, a proof-of-concept validation is conducted using a
   simulated enterprise network under DDoS attack, which is a typical MSCA
   variant. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The coupling of power systems with cyber networks poses security issues
   that may threaten the safety and robustness of power systems. In this
   paper, by combining stochastic process with a state transition
   description, a stochastic model is presented for describing cascading
   failure in a cyber-coupled smart grid. A dedicated algorithm is
   developed to simulate the dynamic profile of the cascading failures,
   with consideration of the effect of power overloading, malware contagion
   and interdependency between the power grid and cyber network.
   Stimulation results on two test cases show that the dynamic profile of
   the cascading failures in the coupled system displays a
   ``staircase-like{''} pattern, which can be interpreted as a combined
   feature of the typical step propagation profile triggered repeatedly by
   cyber attacks due to network coupling. Furthermore, compared with the
   isolated power system without coupling cyber network, both the extent
   and rapidity of power blackouts were intensified by the cyber coupling
   especially under the cyber attack.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a hybrid evolutionary computation (HEC) algorithm
   for solving the optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) problem.
   Traditionally, ORPD is defined as the minimization of active power
   transmission losses by controlling a number of control variables. In
   this paper, the deviation of bus voltage magnitude which influences the
   security operation of power transmission systems is also considered as
   an objective function. ORPD is typically a nonlinear constrained
   optimization problem. The proposed HEC algorithm combines basic
   differential evolution (DE) algorithm and probabilistic state transition
   rule used in the ant system to deal with the ORPD problem. To verify the
   performance of the proposed method, the similar evolution approaches
   such as evolutionary programming (EP) and particle swarm optimization
   (PSO) are also implemented using the same database. The proposed method
   has been verified on the IEEE 30-bus 6-generator system. Testing results
   indicate that the proposed HEC can obtain better results than the other
   methods in terms of active power transmission losses, voltage magnitude
   deviation, and convergence performance.},

Title = {Adaptive management of multimodal biometrics fusion using ant colony

Volume = {32},

Pages = {49-63},

Abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for the adaptive management of
   multimodal biometrics to meet a wide range of application dependent
   adaptive security requirements. In this work, ant colony optimization
   (ACO) is employed for the selection of key parameters like decision
   threshold and fusion rule, to ensure the optimal performance in meeting
   varying security requirements during the deployment of multimodal
   biometrics systems. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been widely
   utilized for the optimal selection of these parameters in the earlier
   attempts in the literature {[}Veeramachaneni et al., 2005] and {[}Kumar
   et al., 2010]. However, in PSO these parameters are computed in
   continuous domain while they are assumed to be better represented as
   discrete variables {[}Kumar et al., 2010]. This paper therefore proposes
   the use of ACO, in which discrete biometric verification parameters are
   computed to ensure the optimal performance from the multimodal
   biometrics system. The proposed ACO based framework is also extended to
   the pattern classification approach where fuzzy binary decision tree
   (FBDT) is utilized for two-class biometrics verification. The
   experimental results are presented on true multimodal systems from
   various publicly available databases; IITD databases of palmprint and
   iris, XM2VTS database of speech and faces, and the NIST BSSR1 databases
   of faces and fingerprint images. Our experimental results presented in
   this paper suggest that (i) ACO based approach is capable of operating
   on significantly small error rates in comparison to the widely employed
   PSO for automated selection of biometrics fusion rules/parameters, (ii)
   the score-level fusion yields better performance with lower error rate
   in comparison to the decision level fusion, and finally (iii) the FBDT
   based classification approach delivers considerably superior performance
   for the adaptive biometrics verification. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Non-interference is a semantic program property that assigns
   confidentiality levels to data objects and prevents illicit information
   flows to occur from high to low security levels. Erasure is a way of
   strengthening confidentiality by upgrading data confidentiality levels,
   up to the extreme of demanding the removal of secret data from the
   system. In this paper, we propose a certification technique for
   confidentiality of complete Java classes that includes non-interference
   and erasure policies. This technique is based on rewriting logic, which
   is a very general logical and semantic framework that is efficiently
   implemented in the high-level programming language Maude. In order to
   achieve a finite state transition system, we develop an abstract Java
   semantics which correctly approximates non-interference and erasure. The
   analysis produces certificates that are independently checkable, and are
   small enough to be used in practice. We have implemented our methodology
   and developed some experiments that demonstrate the feasibility of our
   approach.},

Abstract = {A single N-dimensional quNit quantum secret sharing scheme is proposed.
   In this scheme, extending two bases and four states used in Bennett and
   Brassard protocol (BB84) to multi-bases and multi-states, a distributor
   sends the encoded N-dimensional quantum system to one of his two
   recipients. After receiving the quNit, the recipient makes a unitary
   operation on it using a N-dimensional cloning machine, and then sends it
   to the other recipient. After being informed that the second recipient
   has received the quNit, the distributor announces his preparing base,
   and then the two recipients perform measurements on their systems using
   the same base as the distributor and obtain the sent quantum state after
   collaboration. The security of the scheme is based on quantum
   non-cloning principle. In addition, this scheme has the features of
   great information flux and high efficiency. At last, the generalization
   from two recipients to N recipients is discussed.},

Abstract = {The complexity and volatility of power system operation increase when
   larger parts of the power production is based on distributed and
   non-controllable renewable energy sources. Ensuring stable and secure
   operation becomes more difficult in these modern power systems. For
   security assessment, the results of traditional offline simulations may
   become obsolete prior to the completion of the assessment. In contrast,
   real-time stability and security assessment aims at online computation,
   and it is therefore dependent on very fast computation of properties of
   the grid operating state. The study develops the reduce-factor-solve
   approach to real-time computation of two key components in real-time
   assessment methods, network reduction, and calculation of Thevenin
   impedances. The aim is to allow online stability assessment for very
   complex networks. The theoretical foundation behind the
   reduce-factor-solve approach is described together with the ability to
   handle both algorithms in a common framework. By exploiting
   parallelisation of the reduce and solve steps in combination with fast
   matrix factorisation, Thevenin impedances and reduced networks are
   computed much faster than previous approaches. The reduce-factor-solve
   algorithm is evaluated on power grids of varying complexity to show that
   Thevenin impedance computation and network reduction for complex power
   systems can be performed on a milliseconds time scale.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {We propose and implement an innovative remote attestation framework
   called DR@FT for efficiently measuring a target system based on an
   information flow-based integrity model. With this model, the high
   integrity processes of a system are first measured and verified, and
   these processes are then protected from accesses initiated by low
   integrity processes. Toward dynamic systems with frequently changed
   system states, our framework verifies the latest state changes of a
   target system instead of considering the entire system information. Our
   attestation evaluation adopts a graph-based method to represent
   integrity violations, and the graph-based policy analysis is further
   augmented with a ranked violation graph to support high semantic
   reasoning of attestation results. As a result, DR@FT provides efficient
   and effective attestation of a system's integrity status, and offers
   intuitive reasoning of attestation results for security administrators.
   Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of
   DR@FT.},

Abstract = {Detecting driver's statuses is favorable for reducing the incidence of
   traffic accidents and ensuring driving security. This paper aims to
   develop an efficient system for driving stress detection under real
   driving circumstances. Multiple physiological signals, i.e.,
   electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and respiration
   (RESP) were collected and multi-modal features were extracted from time,
   spectral, and wavelet domains. The proposed approaches are motivated by
   three points: 1) Obvious individual difference affects the
   transferability of trained models to a new drive. Then, through
   dissimilarity evaluation and hierarchical clustering, we searched for
   subgroups of drives that presented relatively consistent feature
   distributions. Performing cross-drive modeling within each subgroup
   enables us to identify driver statuses more precisely with less
   computation cost; 2) fusing the high-dimensional physiological data from
   multiple views is beneficial to achieve a reliable assessment but brings
   new challenges for existing techniques. We adopted Multi-view Intact
   Space Learning (MISL) to integrate rich information from multiple
   perspectives by constructing a latent intact representation of the data;
   3) most of the existing systems are offline. The current study made both
   offline and online analysis to validate the effectiveness of this
   research. Experimental results reveal that the proposed approaches can
   achieve competitive performance to state-of-the-art methods and can be
   developed into intelligent in-vehicle systems to detect driver's
   unfavorable statuses, better adjust their negative affection, and avoid
   traffic accidents.},

Abstract = {This paper presents and an evaluation of results obtained from a face
   recognition system in a real uncontrolled localization. The involved
   infrastructure is Barajas Airport (the international airport in Madrid,
   Spain). The use of this infrastructure during normal operation hours has
   imposed some constrains. It was not allowed to change or to add new
   cameras and passengers should not be disturbed by any means. Passengers
   should not be aware of the presence of the system, so no request should
   be done to change their normal behavior. To fulfill these requirements,
   three video surveillance cameras were selected: two in the corridor
   areas and one in a control point. Images were acquired and processed
   with illumination changes, several quality levels, collaborative and
   non-collaborative subjects and during three weeks. The influence of data
   compression method and classificator has been detailed in the paper.
   Three scenarios were simulated: first one is a normal operational mode,
   second one is a high security mode and last one is a friendly or
   soft-recognition mode. Four data compression methods were considered in
   the paper: 1 dpca (id principal components analysis), 2dpca (2d
   principal components analysis), 2dlda (2d linear discriminant analysis)
   and csa (coupled subspace analysis). Csa has obtained the best
   performance. For classificatory purpoises, svm (support vector machines)
   were selected with excellent results. The overall analysis shows that
   the approach taken will lead to excellent results given the hard
   conditions of a real scenario such an airport.},

Abstract = {In distribution systems, it is important to guarantee the protected
   operating state of the power system by the transmission suppliers. To
   transmit a secure, dependable and economical supply of electric power,
   long separation bulk power transmission is fundamental. Despite that,
   the power transfer capacity of the power system is constrained because
   of the elements like thermal limits, voltage limits and security limits.
   Crow Search Optimizations (CSO) have been exhibited to be reasonable
   methodologies in taking care of nonlinear power system issues with
   Available Transfer Capability (ATC). It is conceivable to improve
   transmission capabilities. This proposed method based on the IEEE 30-bus
   system is considered with two distinct areas, and furthermore, the input
   source is a typical load system with a distributed network. There is a
   need to control the reactive power flow at the Point of Common Coupling
   (PCC) between the grids of various voltage levels. To operate a power
   system securely and furthermore to acquire the benefit of bulk power
   transfer, ATC evaluation is required. The load gets raised from 50\% to
   100\% in the distribution side by including the thermal power plant
   (85\% and 95\% load is included) and with the procured condition, ATC
   and losses are to be determined. This ATC is determined for verified
   power supply to the consumers.},

Abstract = {Detecting chemical species in gas phase has recently received an
   increasing interest mainly for security control, trying to implement new
   systems allowing for extended dynamics and reactivity. In this work, an
   open-loop interrogation strategy is proposed to use radio-frequency
   acoustic transducers as micro-balances for that purpose. The resulting
   system is dedicated to the monitoring of chemical compounds in gaseous
   or liquid-phase state. A 16 Hz standard deviation is demonstrated at 125
   MHz, with a working frequency band in the 60 to 133 MHz range, answering
   the requirements for using Rayleigh-and Love-wave-based delay lines
   operating with 40-mu m acoustic wavelength transducers. Moreover, this
   electronic setup was used to interrogate a high-overtone bulk acoustic
   wave resonator (HBAR) microbalance, a new sensor class allowing for
   multi-mode interrogation for gravimetric measurement improvement. The
   noise source still limiting the system performance is due to the
   analog-to-digital converter of the microcontroller, thus leaving open
   degrees-of-freedom for improving the obtained results by optimizing the
   voltage reference and board layout. The operation of the system is
   illustrated using a calibrated galvanic deposition at the surface of
   Love-wave delay lines to assess theoretical predictions of their
   gravimetric sensitivity and to compare them with HBAR-based sensor
   sensitivity.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a work on how to assure the dependability of a
   crypto system built across on and off the blockchain by using the
   proposed adaptive checkpoint and rollback algorithm, and a prototype is
   developed for demonstration purpose.
   The theoretical background of the proposed checkpoint and rollback
   algorithm is studied to characterize the variables affecting the
   dependability such as security, authenticity and reliability with
   respect to the rates of hit by any events of those issues, the rates to
   detect and diagnose, and then the rate to vote for a consensus whether
   to trigger a rollback or not. Based on the variables characterization in
   a stochastic manner, then steady state probabilities and state
   transition probabilities are derived in order to assure the ultimate
   effective dependability of each individual dependability variable (i.e.,
   security, authenticity and reliability), then finally to assure the
   dependability in a compound manner with each variable assigned a weight
   depending on the nature of the systems specifications.
   Based on the theoretical study, a protype of a crypto system is built to
   demonstrated the underlying architecture and operations and to justify
   the need for such system to take synergistic advantages from both on-
   and off-chain blockchains, with an experimental result of a benefit in
   gas fee which is the most exigently addressed issue today in blockchain
   systems especially in Ethereum network of blockchains. An astonishing
   gas fee saving results are demonstrated. It is observed that the crypto
   system benefits more if more computationally intensive transactions are
   executed off-chain while vice versa.},

Abstract = {Hoisting technique plays an important role of spaceflight test and
   launch. Simulation of hoisting technique can promote effectivity and
   safety. Based on finite automata, seven key steps of hoisting technique
   are analyzed. Double-hook erecting process is designed as a key step,
   and analyzed the force of the load. The state transition diagram is
   designed to describe the double-hook erecting. Using ODE as a physics
   engine, the double-hook erecting is simulated by rigid body kinematic.
   With physics engine, the force of the object is calculated by rigid body
   kinematics, and the centroid's displacement is more accurate compared
   with particle kinematics. Also, simulation using the physics engine
   provides a certain reference value for the security of staff, the
   operable range and so on. The hoisting technique simulation system based
   on physics engine has been applied in launch site.},

Abstract = {Non-interference is a semantic program property that assigns
   confidentiality levels to data objects and prevents illicit information
   flows from high to low security levels. In this paper, we extend a
   certification technique for confidentiality of Java classes regarding
   non-interference, in order to consider objects and object aliasing. The
   technique is based on rewriting logic, which is efficiently implemented
   in the high-level programming language Maude. Starting from a previous
   Java abstract semantics specification written in Maude, we develop an
   information flow sensitive Java semantics that allows us to observe
   global non-interference properties, with object aliasing. In order to
   achieve a finite state transition system, we develop an abstract Java
   semantics that we use for secure and effective confidentiality analysis.
   We have implemented our methodology and developed some experiments that
   demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.},

Abstract = {A traitor tracing system is a multi-receiver encryption that allows an
   authority or an arbitrary party (in the case of public traceability) to
   identify malicious users (traitors) that collude to create a pirate
   decoder. A trace-and-revoke system is an extension of the traitor
   tracing system where there is an additional user revocation mechanism
   that the content distributor can use to disable the decryption
   capabilities of compromised keys. Trace-and-revoke systems have been
   extensively studied in the settings of broadcast encryption (BE),
   identity-based encryption (IBE), and attribute-based encryption (ABE),
   but not functional encryption (FE). Recently, Do, Phan and Pointcheval
   (CT-RSA'20) studied traitor tracing for FE and proposed the first
   traceable inner-product functional encryption (IPFE) scheme. However,
   their scheme is selectively secure against chosen-plaintext attacks and
   supports one-target black-box traceability (a weaker notion of black-box
   traceability). In addition, their scheme does not support public
   traceability nor user revocation. In this work, we study
   trace-and-revoke mechanisms for FE and propose the first efficient
   trace-and-revoke IPFE systems from standard assumptions. Our schemes
   support public, black-box traceability, and are proven adaptively secure
   against chosen-plaintext attacks in the standard model. Technically, our
   construction is generic and relies on a generic transformation from IPFE
   schemes to trace-and-revoke IPFE systems. For traitor tracing systems,
   our generic construction also implies the first traceable IPFE schemes
   that simultaneously support public, black-box traceability, and achieve
   adaptive security. This provides a significant improvement over the
   previous traceable IPFE construction by Do, Phan and Pointcheval.},

Title = {Optimal Timing Selection Approach to Moving Target Defense: A FlipIt
   Attack-Defense Game Model},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {The centralized control characteristics of software-defined networks
   (SDNs) make them susceptible to advanced persistent threats (APTs).
   Moving target defense, as an effective defense means, is constantly
   developing. It is difficult to effectively characterize an MTD attack
   and defense game with existing game models and effectively select the
   defense timing to balance SDN service quality and MTD decision-making
   benefits. From the hidden confrontation between the actual attack and
   defense sides, existing attack-defense scenarios are abstractly
   characterized and analyzed. Based on the APT attack process of the Cyber
   Kill Chain (CKC), a state transition model of the MTD attack surface
   based on the susceptible-infective-recuperative-malfunctioned (SIRM)
   infectious disease model is defined. An MTD attack-defense timing
   decision model based on the FlipIt game (FG-MTD) is constructed, which
   expands the static analysis in the traditional game to a dynamic
   continuous process. The Nash equilibrium of the proposed method is
   analyzed, and the optimal timing selection algorithm of the MTD is
   designed to provide decision support for the selection of MTD timing
   under moderate security. Finally, the application model is used to
   verify the model and method. Through numerical analysis, the timings of
   different types of attack-defense strategies are summarized.},

Title = {Defense Mechanisms against Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grid Networks},

Abstract = {In the smart grid, bidirectional information exchange among customers,
   operators, and control devices significantly improves the efficiency of
   energy supplying and consumption. However, integration of intelligence
   and cyber systems into a power grid can lead to serious cyber security
   challenges and makes the overall system more vulnerable to cyber
   attacks. To address this challenging issue, this article presents
   defense mechanisms to either protect the system from attackers in
   advance or detect the existence of data injection attacks to improve the
   smart grid security. Focusing on signal processing techniques, this
   article introduces an adaptive scheme on detection of injected bad data
   at the control center. This scheme takes the power measurements of two
   sequential data collection slots into account, and detects data
   injection attacks by monitoring the measurement variations and state
   changes between the two time slots. The proposed scheme has the
   capability of adaptively detecting attacks including both non-stealthy
   attacks and stealthy attacks. Stealthy attacks are proved impossible to
   detect using conventional residual-based methods, and can cause more
   dangerous effects on power systems than non-stealthy attacks. It is
   demonstrated that the proposed scheme can also be used for attack
   classification to help system operators prioritize their actions to
   better protect their systems, and is therefore very valuable in
   practical smart grid systems.},

Title = {Stochastic Co-Optimization of Midterm and Short-Term Maintenance Outage
   Scheduling Considering Covariates in Power Systems},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {31},
Number = {6},
Pages = {4795-4805},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This paper proposes an integrated framework based on covariates, which
   coordinates short-term generation and transmission maintenance
   scheduling with midterm maintenance decisions by considering the effects
   of short-term security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC). A recursive
   sampling method is introduced in the proposed Monte Carlo-based
   framework for generating scenarios, in which the effects of component
   aging and covariates on the outage process are quantified by the
   proportional hazard model (PHM). For each sampled scenario, an iterative
   dynamic scenario updating approach is introduced to consider
   interactions among covariate conditions, random component outages, and
   maintenance outage scheduling. The co-optimization problem is decoupled
   into three separate optimization subproblems by Lagrangian relaxation
   (LR), which include generation maintenance scheduling, transmission
   maintenance scheduling, and short-term SCUC problems. Each scenario is
   dynamically updated based on the optimal maintenance outage and SCUC
   solutions, and maintenance and SCUC solutions are re-optimized using the
   updated scenario. The iterative procedure stops when neither the optimal
   schedule nor the dynamic scenario changes any further. The overall
   convergence of the proposed Monte Carlo-based framework is checked by
   the coefficient of variation (CV) of costs over multiple scenarios. Case
   studies on the 6-bus system and the IEEE 118-bus system are used to
   exhibit the effectiveness of proposed framework.},

Title = {Photonic quantum data locking},
Journal = {QUANTUM},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Quantum data locking is a quantum phenomenon that allows us to encrypt a
   long message with a small secret key with information-theoretic
   security. This is in sharp contrast with classical information theory
   where, according to Shannon, the secret key needs to be at least as long
   as the message. Here we explore photonic architectures for quantum data
   locking, where information is encoded in multi-photon states and
   processed using multi-mode linear optics and photo-detection, with the
   goal of extending an initial secret key into a longer one. The secret
   key consumption depends on the number of modes and photons employed. In
   the no-collision limit, where the likelihood of photon bunching is
   suppressed, the key consumption is shown to be logarithmic in the
   dimensions of the system. Our protocol can be viewed as an application
   of the physics of Boson Sampling to quantum cryptography. Experimental
   realisations are challenging but feasible with state-of-the-art
   technology, as techniques recently used to demonstrate Boson Sampling
   can be adapted to our scheme (e.g., Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 250503, 2019).},

Abstract = {The preventive control for static voltage stability is one of the

   multi-contingency preventive control model for static voltage stability

   the grid's voltage stability when potentially complex contingencies
   occur. This model aims to minimize the control cost while maintaining
   the feasibility of normal operating state and keeping proper static
   voltage stability margin for each contingency considered. The selecting
   method of the key contingencies set is provided based on the requirement
   of static voltage stability margin. Meanwhile, the model is optimally
   solved according to the key contingencies set and then the corresponding
   preventive control strategies are obtained and implemented. The solving
   algorithm is further cycled until the voltage stability margins under
   all contingencies are satisfied the requirements. The validity of the
   proposed model and algorithm is verified through simulation tests in

Abstract = {Aiming at the problem of short-circuit protection, a novel bridge-type
   topology of fault current limiting (FCL) is established based on
   resonant characteristics. It is equivalent to a piece of wire during the
   normal operating state. When short-circuit fault occurs, the dc limiting
   reactor inserts automatically and rapidly under the joint action of the
   capacitor, limiting the increasing speed and amplitude of fault current,
   therefore protects the security of the equipment. Compared with the
   original topologies, the novel topology proposed reduces the number of
   controllable devices, simplifies the control system, and reduces the
   design value and size of the dc limiting reactor, which makes it has the
   advantages of high reliability, low cost, and minimum maintenance
   requirements. The structure and working principle of the FCL proposed
   are elaborated in detail. Meanwhile, a topology of its application in
   unified power flow controller (UPFC) is proposed to verify its function.
   Simulations prove the feasibility of the new FCL.},

Abstract = {Injection of reactive power into power systems through FACTs devices has
   been identified as one of the ways through which the existing power
   network operation could be enhanced. However, identification of suitable
   locations, where the effect of these FACTs devices will be most
   beneficial to the network, has been a growing concern to electric power
   utilities in planning and operation of power systems. Consequently, a
   safe and reliable power system operation requires that all operating
   states, which could be used to enhance power system operation such as
   voltage profile enhancement and loss reduction, must be quickly detected
   and identified. This paper, therefore, introduces a Line Strength Index
   (LSI) for identifying suitable locations where reactive power supports
   such as Thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) could be located
   for voltage profile enhancement and transmission loss reduction within
   the system. Furthermore, the influence of TCSC placement on the voltage
   profile and transmission losses is investigated. The effectiveness of
   the approach is demonstrated on a simple 6-bus power network. The
   results obtained are compared with that obtained when TCSC is placed at
   a randomly selected location. This shows that the integrity of a
   stressed power network, in terms of security and reliability, could be
   easily enhanced through the application of TCSC whose placement is
   determined by LSI, a non-iterative-based approach.},

Abstract = {COSMO-SkyMed is an Earth Observation dual-use (civilian and Defence)
   system based on a constellation of four mid-sized satellites, in Low
   Earth Orbit, carrying multi-mode high resolution SAR instruments
   dedicated to resource management and security applications for civilian
   and Defence use.
   The operational capacity of COSMO-SkyMed has no world-wide competitors
   thank to the satellites overall nominal capability of sensing and
   downloading up to 1800 images every day. During the last 6 years
   COSMO-SkyMed has been employed to provide ``Institutional Awareness{''},
   in order to make proper decisions to prevent, respond and manage
   world-wide crises, to assess damages and supply fundamental information
   to rescue from catastrophic situations.
   Even though the first two satellites have already reached their nominal
   End-of-Life, the constellation is still able to provide the products
   with the required image quality and geolocation performance, fully
   sustaining the associated operational loads and granting the required
   level of service in terms of availability and efficiency.
   The second generation of the system (COSMO-SkyMed di Seconda
   Generazione, CSG) is being developed. After an interim phase, CSG will
   become a unique integrated system able to manage a constellation of up
   to 6 satellites (2 CSG and up to 4 first generation satellites),
   granting the operational continuity with the first generation system.},

Abstract = {In this paper we introduce the notion of lockable obfuscation. In a
   lockable obfuscation scheme there exists an obfuscation algorithm Obf
   that takes as input a security parameter, a program P, a message msg and
   ``lock value{''} lck and outputs an obfuscated program oP. One can
   evaluate the obfuscated program oP on any input x where the output of
   evaluation is the message msg if P(x) = lck and otherwise receives a
   rejecting symbol.
   We proceed to provide a construction of lockable obfuscation and prove
   it secure under the Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption. Notably, our
   proof only requires LWE with polynomial hardness and does not require
   complexity leveraging.
   We follow this by describing multiple applications of lockable
   obfuscation. First, we show how to transform any attributebased
   encryption (ABE) scheme into one in which the attributes used to encrypt
   the message are hidden from any user that is not authorized to decrypt
   the message. (Such a system is also know as predicate encryption with
   one-sided security.) The only previous construction due to Gorbunov,
   Vaikuntanathan and Wee is based off of a specific ABE scheme of Boneh et
   al. By enabling the transformation of any ABE scheme we can inherent
   different forms and features of the underlying scheme such as:
   multi-authority, adaptive security from polynomial hardness, regular
   language policies, etc.
   We also show applications of lockable obfuscation to separation and
   uninstantiability results. We first show how to create new separation
   results in circular encryption that were previously based on
   indistinguishability obfuscation. This results in new separation results
   from learning with error including a public key bit encryption scheme
   that it IND-CPA secure and not circular secure. The tool of lockable
   obfuscation allows these constructions to be almost immediately realized
   by translation from previous indistinguishability obfuscation based
   constructions.
   In a similar vein we provide random oracle uninstantiability results of
   the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation (and related transformations) from
   the lockable obfuscation combined with fully homomorphic encryption.
   Again, we take advantage that previous work used indistinguishability
   obfuscation that obfuscated programs in a form that could easily be
   translated to lockable obfuscation.},

Abstract = {Based on a proven, century-old archival technique, we have successfully
   demonstrated the feasibility of storing high density, multi-state data
   in the form of interference gratings embedded in archival silver halide
   media. Data stored as interference gratings cannot be erased remotely,
   or altered after writing and processing, yielding a verifiable backup
   storage tier for archives and data security applications. WORF is
   engineered to be a permanent and low energy data storage medium not
   requiring periodic refreshing or authentication. Should the original
   reading devices be lost in the far future, human visible instructions
   for creating a reading device and decoding the formats a digital
   ``Rosetta Stone{''} are included on the data media. The unalterable WORF
   medium has ancillary uses for other critical data storage applications

Abstract = {Several regional augmentation GNSS systems (like SBAS) are already fully
   operational and other are under development with new frequencies and
   signals on the way. Therefore, it becomes imperative to guarantee for
   all GNSS users the compatibility, interoperability and
   interchangeability between all these systems. The goal is to ensure that
   the user's multi-mode receiver can choose and mix signals from different
   GNSS and SBAS systems to achieve more availability, accuracy and
   robustness. Attaining that objective will require agreements on
   frequency plans and signal designs, as well as other details including
   means to ensure interoperability of system times and geodetic reference
   systems.
   This paper suggests a Universal-SBAS (U-SBAS) standard, compatible with
   all the existing and planned regional GNSS systems (and their
   evolutions) in the world, like IRNSS, QZSS, PCW, BEIDOU-1, WAAS, EGNOS,
   SDCM, GAGAN, MSAS. The proposed worldwide multimodal U-SBAS standard
   carries additional channels (signals and messages) to cover the
   non-aeronautical specific Safety-of-Life (SoL) services, and also High
   Precision Positioning Services (HPPS), Position Velocity Time (PVT),
   authentication services, safety services, scientific application
   services, High Precision Timing Services (HPTS), etc. U-SBAS is designed
   to be fully interoperable with the current SBAS standards and to allow
   significant performance and service improvements in operational,
   scientific and/or security areas. Finally usage examples of the proposed
   standard are given for different types of applications such as science,
   aviation, precise point positioning, timing, security, robust
   positioning, maritime and reflectometry.},

Abstract = {Previous research has highlighted that all data security systems rest on
   the assumption of accurate user verification. Although much research has
   focused on speech and keystroke characteristics, no study has examined
   the potential of indirect cursor control devices, such as mouse or pen,
   as a means of personal user verification. This paper presents the result
   of an exploratory examination of the measurement of individual users'
   behaviour elicited while using two indirect input devices (puck and
   pen). Ten subjects undertook two series of 500 trials using the puck and
   pen in a counterbalanced design. Each trial involved guiding the cursor
   to one of ten possible targets, projected upon one of five angles of
   projection and one of two distances. Data recorded comprised a series of
   (x,y) coordinates and associated time stamps of each component of the
   movement. Five parameters for each full movement were extracted--total
   time to reach the target, maximum velocity of the movement, maximum
   acceleration for the movement, time to maximum velocity of movement,
   time to maximum acceleration of the movement. Results of a series of
   Multivariate Analyses of Variance indicated that for both the puck and
   the pen data, there were statistically significant differences between
   subjects for each of the five parameters. This set of discriminating
   parameters was then embedded in a verification paradigm. Results
   indicated that the average error rates varied between 39\% (S.D. = 2\%)
   and 14\% (S.D. = 2\%) for the puck and 38\% (S.D. = 2\%) and 12\% (S.D.
   = 2\%) for the pen. Error rates were dependent upon the number of
   samples used when making the verification decision. This research
   suggests that pointing device measurements using the current parameters
   are not a viable method of user verification by themselves. However,
   with average error rates as low as 12\%, it may be reasonable to
   integrate them into a multi-modal security system. Practical
   implications and future research directions are discussed. (C) 1996

Abstract = {Natural gas distribution networks are part of a nation's critical
   infrastructure, ensuring gas delivery to households and industries
   (e.g., power plants) with the correct chemical composition and the right
   conditions of pressure and temperature. Gas distribution is monitored
   and controlled by a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
   network, which provides centralized monitoring and control over the
   physical process.
   In this paper, we conduct the first openly available network measurement
   study of the SCADA network of an operational large-scale natural gas
   distribution network. With a total of 154 remote substations
   communicating through the SCADA system with a Control Room and over 98
   days of observation, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the most
   extensive dataset of this kind analyzed to date.
   By combining the information obtained from engineering and IEC 104
   network traffic, we reconstruct the gas distribution system's layout,
   including the type and purpose of the substations and the physical
   properties of the gas that enters the SCADA system. Our analysis shows
   that it is possible to extract this information, essential for security
   monitoring, purely from the raw network traffic and without background
   knowledge provided by the control system engineers. We also note that
   configuration changes in SCADA environments, although probably less
   frequent than in IT environments, are not as rare and exceptional as the
   research community assumed.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces three refinement patterns for algebraic
   state-transition diagrams (astds): state refinement, transition
   refinement and loop-transition refinement. These refinement patterns are
   derived from practice in using astds for specifying information systems
   and security policies in two industrial research projects. Two
   refinement relations used in these patterns are formally defined. For
   each pattern, proof obligations are proposed to ensure preservation of
   behaviour through refinement. The proposed refinement relations
   essentially consist in preserving scenarios by replacing abstract events
   with concrete events, or by introducing new events. Deadlocks cannot be
   introduced; divergence over new events is allowed in one of the
   refinement relation. We prove congruence-like properties for these three
   patterns, in order to show that they can be applied to a subpart of a
   specification while preserving global properties. These three refinement
   patterns are illustrated with a simple case study of a complaint
   management system.},

Abstract = {A power balancing method of distributed generation (DG) and electric
   vehicle charging is presented for minimizing operation costs of
   distribution systems with uncertainties, which includes the
   uncertainties in output power of DG and the randomness of charging power
   of electric vehicles (EV). A probability model is established for the
   uncertain characteristics of DG and electric vehicle charging. A
   multi-state optimization coordination method for DG of renewable energy
   systems and electric vehicle charging in distribution systems based on
   quadratic rotation cone programming is presented to minimize the
   expected generation cost of generators in the main power grid, the
   expected operation cost of DG systems in distribution systems, and the
   expected social outage loss. An objective function maximizing the
   operation efficiency of distribution systems with DGs and EVs is
   proposed. Using quadratic rotated conic programming, the nonlinear
   objective function and constraint functions are transformed into a
   linear form. An IEEE 14-node distribution system is used as a study
   example to illustrate adaptability of the proposed model and the
   feasibility of the proposed method. The simulation results show that the
   proposed method simplifies the original problem of the optimization
   problem and makes its solution faster, more stable, and better.},

Abstract = {With the informatization of industrial control system, industrial
   communication protocol is facing greater data pressure. At the same
   time, industrial communication protocols will face more security
   threats. In this paper, we use the method of transforming STM (State
   Transition Matrix) model to UPPAAL (a tool for verifying real-time
   system) model. In order to clearly understand the model and avoid some
   mistakes in the early stage of modeling, we first establish STM model
   for Modbus TCP/IP protocol. Finally, it is transformed into UPPAAL
   model. Five types of attributes are verified by UPPAAL tool, including
   the verification of unreachable attributes found by STM modeling. These
   five types of attributes verify the credibility of Modbus TCP/IP
   protocol. The experimental results show that this method can have a
   clear understanding of the model in the early stage. After converting
   STM model into UPPAAL model, more constraints can be found by referring
   to STM model. Compared with the existing methods, it studies the
   credibility of the protocol itself. Therefore, the method can find the
   root of the problem and solve it.},

Abstract = {The current encryption system operates as a hybrid encryption method
   that uses a combination of the symmetric- key method and the
   asymmetric-key method to generate and manage keys for encryption
   communication. Despite the fast processing speed of symmetric key
   encryption methods, due to the problem in key exchange, hybrid
   encryption solves the security problem of key exchange using asymmetric
   key method. The asymmetric-key method is difficult to provide smooth
   services due to the decrease in processing speed caused by computational
   complexity. The hybrid method is designed to take advantage of the fast
   processing speed of the symmetrickey, and the secure exchange method of
   the key used in the symmetric- key operates by using the asymmetric-key.
   However, with the advent of quantum computer technology, encryption
   techniques using the asymmetric-key method are changing in the same way
   as increasing the key size used. Therefore, we will explain the AI
   application method using the state change of Rubik's cube to generate
   keys in the latest state in the symmetric- key encryption system. The
   application of the Rubik's cube state change algorithm, which operates
   on the AI base described in this paper, has the advantage of inducing
   and using the used key without exchanging the pre-shared key. Because of
   this key induction method, malicious attackers have little information
   on the keys used for encryption and decryption, so it is judged that the
   confidentiality and integrity of key generation and management can be
   secured more safely. We intend to improve the problem of key exchange
   and management in existing encryption systems by generating and managing
   keys through the Rubik's cube state change algorithm, which operates
   based on AI.},

Abstract = {Continuous location authentication (CLA) seeks to continuously and
   automatically verify the physical presence of legitimate users in a
   protected indoor area. CLA can play an important role in contexts where
   access to electrical or physical resources must be limited to physically
   present legitimate users. In this paper, we present WearRF-CLA, a novel
   CLA scheme built upon increasingly popular wrist wearables and UHF RFID
   systems. WearRF-CLA explores the observation that human daily routines
   in a protected indoor area comprise a sequence of human-states (e.g.,
   walking and sitting) that follow predictable state transitions. Each
   legitimate WearRF-CLA user registers his/her RFID tag and also wrist
   wearable during system enrollment. After the user enters a protected
   area, WearRF-CLA continuously collects and processes the gyroscope data
   of the wrist wearable and the phase data of the RFID tag signals to
   verify three factors to determine the user's physical presence/absence
   without explicit user involvement: (1) the tag ID as in a traditional
   RFID authentication system, (2) the validity of the human-state chain,
   and (3) the continuous coexistence of the paired wrist wearable and RFID
   tag with the user. The user passes CLA if and only if all three factors
   can be validated. Extensive user experiments on commodity smartwatches
   and UHF RFID devices confirm the very high security and low
   authentication latency of WearRF-CLA.},

Abstract = {Intrusion detection is a surveillance problem of practical import that
   is well suited to wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we study the
   application of sensor networks to the intrusion detection problem and
   the related problems of classifying and tracking targets. Our approach
   is based on a dense, distributed, wireless network of multi-modal
   resource-poor sensors combined into loosely coherent sensor arrays that
   perform in situ detection, estimation, compression, and exfiltration. We
   ground our study in the context of a security scenario called ``A Line
   in the Sand{''} and accordingly define the target, system, environment,
   and fault models. Based on the performance requirements of the scenario
   and the sensing, communication, energy, and computation ability of the
   sensor network, we explore the design space of sensors, signal
   processing algorithms, communications, networking, and middleware
   services. We introduce the influence field, which can be estimated from
   a network of binary sensors, as the basis for a novel classifier. A
   contribution of our work is that we do not assume a reliable network; on
   the contrary, we quantitatively analyze the effects of network
   unreliability on application performance. Our work includes multiple
   experimental deployments of over 90 sensor nodes at MacDill Air Force
   Base in Tampa, FL, as well as other field experiments of comparable
   scale. Based on these experiences, we identify a set of key lessons and
   articulate a few of the challenges facing extreme scaling to tens or
   hundreds of thousands of sensor nodes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Reinforced practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol for
   cyber physical systems},
Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Pages = {238-247},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are becoming an essential component of
   modern life. CPS services enable information to be exchanged between
   physical devices and virtual systems. The increasing malicious
   activities causing confidential data leakage and incorrect performance
   of devices are posing challenges for protection against cyber threats.
   Therefore, development of effective solutions that can protect both CPS
   data and data exchange networks are extremely urgent. This study makes
   some improvements on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and
   provides a critical analysis of the feasibility of using blockchain
   technology to protect constrained CPS data. It also justifies the choice
   of the improved PBFT for implementation on such devices and simulates
   the main distributed ledger scenarios. The improved PBFT works as
   follows: first, the client broadcasts the signed transaction data to the
   entire network, rather than just the master node, followed by a hash
   value comparison verification process; second, select the master node
   based on the longest chain principle, and punish the malicious node via
   the ``blacklist'' mechanism; third, add the data synchronization and
   verification process, as well as dynamically entering and leaving nodes
   via state transitions. Ultimately, the PBFT commit phase is eliminated,
   resulting in a two-stage process. In comparison to the original PBFT
   protocol, the Reinforced Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (RPBFT)
   protocol may substantially enhance system throughput and minimize
   consensus communication time, thereby improving overall system
   efficiency while guaranteeing security.},

Title = {RMOBF-Net: Network for the Restoration of Motion and Optical Blurred
   Finger-Vein Images for Improving Recognition Accuracy},

Abstract = {Biometrics is a method of recognizing a person based on one or more
   unique physical and behavioral characteristics. Since each person has a
   different structure and shape, it is highly secure and more convenient
   than the existing security system. Among various biometric
   authentication methods, finger-vein recognition has advantages in that
   it is difficult to forge because a finger-vein exists inside one's
   finger and high user convenience because it uses a non-invasive device.
   However, motion and optical blur may occur for some reasons such as
   finger movement and camera defocusing during finger-vein recognition,
   and such blurring occurrences may increase finger-vein recognition
   error. However, there has been no research on finger-vein recognition
   considering both motion and optical blur. Therefore, in this study, we
   propose a new method for increasing finger-vein recognition accuracy
   based on a network for the restoration of motion and optical blurring in
   a finger-vein image (RMOBF-Net). Our proposed network continuously
   maintains features that can be utilized during motion and optical blur
   restoration by actively using residual blocks and feature concatenation.
   Also, the architecture RMOBF-Net is optimized to the finger-vein image
   domain. Experimental results are based on two open datasets, the
   Shandong University homologous multi-modal traits finger-vein database
   and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University finger-image database version
   1, from which equal error rates of finger-vein recognition accuracy of
   4.290-5.779\% and 2.465-6.663\% were obtained, respectively. Higher
   performance was obtained from the proposed method compared with that of
   state-of-the-art methods.},

Abstract = {Access control mechanisms protect critical resources of systems from
   unauthorized access. In a policy-based management approach,
   administrators define user privileges as rules that determine the
   conditions and the extent of users' access rights. As rules become more
   complex, analytical skills are required to identify conflicts and
   interactions within the rules that comprise a system policy-especially
   when rules are stateful and depend on event histories. Without adequate
   tool support such an analysis is error-prone and expensive. In
   consequence, many policy specifications are inconsistent or conflicting
   that render the system insecure. The security of the system, however,
   does not only depend on the correct specification of the security
   policy, but in a large part also on the correct interpretation of those
   rules by the system's enforcement mechanism.
   In this paper, we show how policy rules can be formalized in Fusion
   Logic, a temporal logic for the specification of behavior of systems. A
   symbolic decision procedure for Fusion Logic based on Binary Decision
   Diagrams (BDDs) is provided and we introduce a novel technique for the
   construction of enforcement mechanisms of access control policy rules
   that uses a BDD encoded enforcement automaton based on input traces
   which reflect state changes in the system. We provide examples of
   verification of policy rules, such as absence of conflicts, and dynamic
   separation of duty and of the enforcement of policies using our
   prototype implementation (FLCheck) for which we detail the underlying
   theory.},

Abstract = {Agriculture is a major user of ground and surface water, accounting for
   similar to 70\% of the world's freshwater withdrawals. The rising
   agricultural water demand potentially leads to a conflict with water use
   among urban, industrial and agricultural sectors. It also threatens food
   security, human life and the environment worldwide. The urgent need for
   alternative water resources motivates the exploration of atmospheric
   water as an abundant and untapped source of freshwater for irrigated
   agriculture. Herein, kelp-derived hydrogel beads with self-contained
   properties (i.e., hygroscopic, photothermal, temperature-responsive and
   durable) are developed via shape-controlled and mass fabrication. The
   hygroscopic beads attain maximum water uptake of over 5.0 g g(-1) under
   90\% relative humidity (RH). Synergistic photothermal heating and
   temperature-driven phase transition afford multi-modal water desorption
   and efficient water release. Over 95\% of absorbed water can be rapidly
   released under a broad solar intensity of 0.6-1 sun and temperature
   range of 40-60 degrees C. A solar-powered and sorption-based seed
   propagator is developed and demonstrated to sustain the plant
   germination and growth, taking the advantages of the hydrogel beads'
   reversible moisture sorption/desorption in night/day cycles, the high
   quality of irrigation water, net-zero energy consumption and thermal
   management in a system-level design. This work provides a perspective on
   controlled and mass fabrication of hygroscopic hydrogels. It highlights
   the solar-powered atmospheric water irrigation for electricity-free and
   sustainable agriculture regardless of varied geographical and hydrologic
   conditions.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Pages = {662-673},

Abstract = {With various components and complex topologies, the applications of
   high-voltage direct current (HVDC) links bring new challenges to the
   interconnected power systems in the aspect of frequency security, which
   further influence their reliability performances. Consequently, this
   paper presents an approach to evaluate the impacts of the HVDC link
   outage on the reliability of interconnected power system considering the
   frequency regulation process during system contingencies. Firstly, a
   multi-state model of an HVDC link with different available loading rates
   (ALRs) is established based on its reliability network. Then, dynamic
   frequency response models of the inter- connected power system are
   presented and integrated with a novel frequency regulation scheme
   enabled by the HVDC link. The proposed scheme exploits the temporary
   overload capability of normal converters to compensate for the
   imbalanced power during system contingencies. Moreover, it offers
   frequency support that enables the frequency regulation reserves of the
   sending-end and receiving-end power systems to be mutually available.
   Several indices are established to measure the system reliability based
   on the given models in terms of abnormal frequency duration, frequency
   deviation, and energy losses of the frequency regulation process during
   system contingencies. Finally, a modified two-area reliability test
   system (RTS) with an HVDC link is adopted to verify the proposed
   approach.},

Abstract = {This paper considers partially-observed discrete-event systems where
   sensors are associated with events observable to an agent monitoring the
   system. The agent is capable of turning the sensors for events on and
   off dynamically, depending on the trajectory of the system. Reading data
   from the sensors may be costly so it is imperative that their use be
   reduced for reasons such as energy, bandwidth or security. When a sensor
   for an event is on / active any occurrence of the event is detected by
   the agent and is not detected otherwise. The agent may employ different
   sensor activation policies, depending on the task at hand. Sensor
   activation policies are defined over the transitions of a
   state-transition representation of the system. From sensor activation
   policies a map from observed event sequences to sensor activation
   decisions can be computed which the agent can use to determine which
   sensors to turn on / off and when. In this paper, we consider two
   subclasses of sensor activation policies of increasing generality. For
   each subclass, we demonstrate ways to compute maps from observed event
   sequences to sensor activation decisions in polynomial time.},

Abstract = {Opacity is a confidentiality property that arises in the analysis of
   security properties in networked systems. It characterizes whether
   a{''}secret{''} of a system can be inferred by an outside observer
   called an{''} intruder.{''} We consider the problem of enforcing opacity
   in partially-observed discrete event systems modeled as automata. We
   propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion
   functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output
   of the system that changes the system's output behavior by inserting
   additional observable events. The insertion function must respond to the
   full system's output behavior. Also, the insertion function should not
   create new observed behavior but only replicate existing observable
   strings. We define the property of `` i-enforceability,{''} when there
   exists an insertion function that renders a non-opaque system opaque. To
   synthesize insertion functions that ensure opacity, we define and
   construct a new structure called the{''} All Insertion Structure{''}
   (AIS). The AIS can be used to verify if a given opacity property is
   i-enforceable. The AIS enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in
   a compact state transition structure. If a given opacity property has
   been verified to be i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to
   synthesize an i-enforcing insertion function.},

   wavelength{''} configuration of light within the media, which is
   restructured as a data constellation. Hitherto unreported chemical and
   optical phenomena are documented. WORF presents novel opportunities for
   security, encryption, data compression, and simple information recovery
   for the far future. It is known that AgX will last many centuries in
   ambient room temperature without continuous energy inputs or continual
   replication and authentication. This is an ``existence proof{''} for the
   long-term archivability of data storage based on AgX chemistry.},

Title = {Minimization of cost and congestion management using interline power
   flow controller},

   ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to optimally locate and size the
   FACTS device, namely, interline power flow controller in order to
   minimize the total cost and relieve congestion in a power system. This
   security analysis helps independent system operator (ISO) to have a
   better planning and market clearing criteria during any operating state
   of the system.
   Design/methodology/approach - A multi-objective optimization problem has
   been developed including real power performance index (RPPI) and
   expected security cost (ESC). A security constrained optimal power flow
   has been developed as expected security cost optimal power flow problem
   which gives the probabilities of operating the system in all possible
   pre-contingency and post-contingency states subjected to various
   equality and inequality constraints. Maximizing social welfare is the
   objective function considered for normal state, while minimizing
   compensations for generations rescheduling and maximizing social welfare
   are the objectives in case of contingency states. The proposed work is
   viewed as a two level problem wherein the upper-level problem is to
   optimally locate IPFC using RPPI and the lower-level problem is to
   minimize the ESC subjected to various system constraints. Both
   upper-level and lower-level problem are solved using particle swarm
   optimization and The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested
   under severe line outages and has been validated using IEEE 30 bus
   system.
   Findings - The proposed methodology shows that IPFC controls the power
   flows in the network without generation rescheduling or topological
   changes and thus improves the performance of the system. It is found
   that the benefit achieved in the ESC due to the installation of IPFC is
   greater than the annual investment cost of the device. ISO cannot
   achieve minimum total system cost by merely rescheduling generators.
   Instead of rescheduling, FACTS devices can be used for compensation by
   achieving minimum cost. IPFC can be used to compensate the congested
   lines and transfer cheaper power from generators to consumers.
   Originality/value - Operational reliability, financial profitability and
   efficient utilization of the existing transmission system infrastructure
   has been achieved using single FACTS device. Instead of using multiple
   FATCS devices, if a single FACTS device like IPFC which itself can
   compensate several transmission lines is used, then in addition to the
   facility for independently controlled reactive (series) compensation of
   each individual line, it provides a capability to directly transfer real
   power between the compensated lines. Hence an attempt has been made in
   this paper to incorporate IPFC for relieving congestion in a deregulated
   environment. However, no previous researches have considered
   incorporating compensation of multi-transmission line using single IPFC
   in minimizing ESC. Thus, in this paper, the authors indicate how much
   the ESC is reduced by installing IPFC.},

Abstract = {In recent years, important efforts to improve monitoring, protection and
   control of power systems have been explored. In this connection, several
   novel approaches for assessing vulnerability in real time have been
   developed. However, most of the work is commonly focused on tackling
   stability phenomena, while the possible overloads are often treated as
   negligible in real-time power system security. But sometimes, high
   electric post-contingency currents might provoke overloads which could
   increase the system vulnerability problem. This paper presents a novel
   method for assessing the possibility of fast post-contingency overloads
   using Statistical Distribution Factors (SDFs) that allow computing an
   Overload Index (OVI) in real time. First, Monte Carlo-based contingency
   analysis is performed to iteratively calculate ac Distribution Factors
   (ac-DFs). After, SDFs are defined by the mean and standard deviation of
   ac-DFs. These SDFs are then used together with principal component
   analysis (PCA) and support vector machine classifier (SVM-C) in order to
   structure a table-based real-time post-contingency overload estimation
   algorithm, which allow computing OVIs depending on the actual operating
   state and the type of contingency. The proposal is tested on the IEEE
   New England 39-bus test system. Results show the feasibility of the
   methodology in alerting about fast possible overloads.},

Title = {Lessons Learned From the Generator Loss of Field at a Cogeneration

Abstract = {The contribution of this paper is that we present experiences from
   dealing with practical issues related to synchronous machine stability
   events. We describe and analyze the scenarios of generator loss-of-field
   occurring two times at a cogeneration thermal power plant in Taiwan in
   the years 2003 and 2005. Since the total production loss from both
   events was quite large, some improvements have been implemented to
   prevent the recurrence of similar events in the future. They consist of
   installing the sequence of events recorder at the generator output
   terminal, regulating the generator lagging power factor operation from
   0.95-0.99 to 0.91, adjusting the tap position to decrease the secondary
   voltage of the 161 kV/161 kV interconnecting transformer, operating the
   phase-leading capacitors attached with a multi-stage chain cut-off
   control unit, and running two or three generators in automatic voltage
   regulation mode instead of automatic power factor regulation mode.
   Although similar events occurred twice at the same power plant in 2006,
   the generating units were capable of continuous stable operation which
   had effectively verified the improvements of operational changes. In
   conclusion, we suggest that the operating modes of generators in a
   cogeneration plant should re-examine constantly as well as monitor power
   quality of different end-user sectors continuously in order to ensure
   the security of power-system operation.},

Abstract = {High Performance Computing (HPC) has been employed in many fields such
   as aerospace, weather forecast, numerical simulation, scientific
   research etc. Security of HPC, especially anomaly/intrusion detection,
   has attracted many attentions in recent years. Given the heavily
   instrumented property of HPC systems, logs become an effective and
   direct data source that can be utilized to evaluate the system status,
   further, to detect anomalies or malicious users. In this paper, we offer
   a novel perspective, treating the anomaly detection in HPC as a
   sequential decision process, and further applying reinforcement learning
   techniques to learn the state transition process, based on which we
   build a framework named as ReLog to detect anomalies or malicious users.
   Besides, a common challenge of employing machine learning techniques is
   lacking sufficient data, we provide a generative adversarial network
   (GAN)-based solution to generate sufficient training data in HPC. The
   experimental validations are conducted based on real-world collected MPI
   logs, and our results demonstrate a 93\% of detection accuracy on the
   collected dataset.},

Abstract = {SYSML, dedicated to system design, provides graphical models. One of the
   strengths of these graphical models is that they can be validated by
   domain experts. However, the semantics of SYSML is given in natural
   language, which does not allow formal and rigorous reasoning necessary
   for critical systems for which safety and security are major concerns.
   Our project aims at modeling and verifying high-level architectures of
   critical complex systems, in particular railways systems, that must be
   validated by domain experts. For that, we propose to combine SYSML and
   the EVENT-B formal method. To master the complexity of such systems,
   EVENT-B provides refinement and decomposition mechanisms that allow a
   step-by-step design and make proofs easier to discharge. This paper
   proposes to extend SYSML with safety relevant EVENT-B mechanisms that
   enable an automatic translation from SYSML diagrams to EVENT-B
   specifications. We focus on diagrams that facilitate high-level
   architecture design, namely package, block-definition, state-transition
   and sequence diagrams.},

Abstract = {Storing, viewing, and analyzing network flows in a Cloud environment is
   an important Virtualized Network Function (VNF) for Cloud tenants and
   users. It is used to store, track, and analyze traffic that belongs to
   Virtual Networks (VNETs), Virtual Machines (VMs), or Network Interfaces
   (NICs). It is used for logging ingress and egress IP traffic flows,
   number of bytes and packets transmitted and received, and network
   connections. Flow logging is critical for the investigation of firewall
   functionalities, security incidents, and threat detection. Moreover, it
   can be used for detecting connection and network anomalies such as
   connection outages, configuration changes, or malicious activities.
   Alerts can be fired for any suspicious network activities. Visualization
   of flows logs provides insights such as who is using a web-service or an
   application, when customers are logged in and out, and what are the
   geographical locations where connections are being initiated or
   terminated. In this paper, a novel method for VNF that details the
   framework for logging network flows in a Cloud environment is provided.
   The method aims at accommodating multiple and simulations Cloud tenants
   and enabling the logging of network flows while at the same time
   accommodates high incoming rates of flow events and data. One of the
   major benefits of this new method is that it supports high number of
   flows per second that facilitates flow logging of high traffic volumes.
   Not only customers can experience higher number of flows logged, but the
   flow logs are visualized and contain the number of packets and bytes
   transmitted and received for outbound and inbound flows, respectively.},

Abstract = {Recent trends show an increase in usage of mobile devices in business
   and home environments. With these devices getting more integrated into
   the lives of many people, great security concern arises. However, these
   devices continue to use passwords or Personal Identification Number
   (PIN) which are not suitable for touch screens displays they feature and
   are proven to be unsafe, tedious to use, and hard to recall. We
   developed a new authentication scheme that will take advantage of touch
   technology using action-based state transition that can be used with
   minimal reading skills. Using image manipulation instead of text, we
   tried to address the usability and recall difficulties present with
   existing authentication schemes. Initial deployment with college
   students shows high level of interest among testers and approval of the
   testers for the scheme as a viable replacement for text-based passwords.
   Results show a 70 \% login success rate with an expected increase as the
   system become more familiar with users.},

Abstract = {Millions of small Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS), or drones weighing
   less than 55 pounds, will fly in urban airspaces within a decade. This
   is in addition to goals for increased Urban Air Mobility (UAM): larger
   transportation UAS and piloted air vehicles, including air taxi service
   and innovative aviation designs to revolutionize transportation. A
   significant problem is the lack of current management systems for this
   extremely large volume of air traffic, composed of heterogeneous drone
   shapes, sizes, and onboard equipment capabilities, flying adjacent to
   larger UAM vehicles in spaces previously unoccupied by General Aviation
   (GA). Robust and resilient detection, identification, localization, and
   tracking of sUAS sharing UAM airspace is complicated by urban factors
   such as non-transmitting, non-cooperative drones. Exacerbating these
   challenges, current technological limitations and vulnerabilities in
   Global Positioning System (GPS), Automatic Dependent
   Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)
   can pose safety and security threats. To streamline a vision of safe and
   secure sUAS-UAM shared airspace, we propose Drone Net, a UAS Traffic
   Management (UTM) network of multi-modal ground and flight instruments.
   Drone Net is an architecture fusing a network of passive visual and
   acoustic sensor nodes with active Radio Detection and Ranging (radar)
   and Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) sensing methods for UTM,
   designed for integration with existing Air Traffic Control (ATC) and
   future UAM systems. The purpose of the Drone Net system is to evaluate
   use of Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) and acoustic arrays networked
   within an urban UAS operating region such as uncontrolled Class-G and
   waivergranted Class-D airspace. The Drone Net approach combines
   detection, tracking, and localization estimation from radar, ADSB, and
   EO/IR such that the design is robust to sensor errors, sample loss, and
   spoofing or other types of attacks. The system experimental design
   allows for emulation of corrupted ADS-B, GPS, and INS data on our flight
   platform including capability to communicate with ground radar and EO/IR
   to recover from flight instrument major and minor malfunctions such that
   a Drone Net cooperative UAS can be engineered to be fail-safe and
   fail-secure. We hypothesize that the Drone Net network of rooftop
   sensors, shown below, provides this conceptualized fail-safe,
   fail-secure property based upon the combination of self-localization
   with backup and confirming data from the ground sensor network.
   Further, with ground-system sensor fusion as well as UTM flight plan and
   registration information fusion, the overall system can manage small UAS
   that are both compliant and noncompliant alongside GA and UAM more
   safely than a single mode like ADS-B alone. To test our hypothesis, we
   envision two experiments this year. First, a test to confirm that we can
   emulate ADS-B, GPS, and INS sensor data corruption, leading to recovery
   using backup flight (lidar, EO/IR) or ground (radar, EO/IR) data to
   safely land an ALTA6 or other test UAS. Second, a series of
   Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) experiments between our test UAS and a tethered
   aerial obstacle. In the future, we will use this experience with
   fail-safe, fail-secure methods and software to further test more
   advanced scenarios between multiple UAS.
   The network of Drone Net instruments in a local area as well as regional
   and more global cloud-based networks will allow for heterogeneous
   information fusion and algorithm development for multi-sensor drone
   detection, classification, and identification with more accuracy than a
   single database or sensor system. The latent power of the Drone Net
   project is in its open-design ground and flight sensor network with data
   sharing capability to improve data mining and machine learning over time
   for analysis and security applications. More concrete applications for
   Drone Net include UTM integration with ATC and UAM, but also airspace
   safety and security for campus and public venues in general. Herein, we
   will present our experimental design and current test data from
   Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in collaboration with University of
   Colorado Boulder toward completing the open specification for ground and
   flight instruments. We would additionally like to invite others to
   participate in growing the network and the data available for UTM, UAM,
   and GA shared airspace research.},

Abstract = {ERCOT has moved from a zonal market to an advanced nodal market since
   December 2010. In ERCOT, combined cycle trains (CCT) contribute a
   significant share of its total installed capacity. Therefore, how to
   accurately and efficiently model the CCT is one of the key factors for a
   successful EROCT nodal market. In order to facilitate market operations
   and ensure the system reliability, the ERCOT nodal market supports the
   modeling of CCT in two different ways: configuration-based modeling and
   physical unit modeling. The complexity of dependency within a combined
   cycle train is tackled by introducing state transition matrix. The
   scheduling and settlement for CCT in Day-Ahead Market (DAM), Reliability
   Unit Commitment (RUC), and Real-Time Market Security Constrained
   Economic Dispatch (SCED) are discussed respectively. Then, calculation
   of Locational Marginal Price (LMP) and Settlement Point Price (SPP) for
   CCT is completely discussed for both Day-Ahead and Real-Time Markets.
   Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the implemented
   CCT modeling.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel optimization model of dynamic voltage
   support planning. It considers the state transition course after great
   disturbance of large-scale receiving end networks (REN). The risk of
   contingency can be equivalent to the annual risk loss and it can be
   reduced by the appropriate dynamic voltage support. The annual risk loss
   consists of state separating risk costs and transferring risk costs. The
   objective function of dynamic voltage support planning is to maximize
   the yearly average profit of the state without and with additional
   dynamic voltage support for the power system. The model is able to
   describe all kinds of voltage instability scenarios caused by REN
   interior faults or interface failures properly. The optimal schemes of
   dynamic voltage support planning of Guangdong receiving end power grids
   in 2008 and 2010 are given as instance based upon the proposed model,
   which shows that the comprehensive allocation schemes are of great
   security and economical efficiency. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Dependability - a measure of a system's availability, reliability, its
   maintainability and safety systems, is an integral part of the integrity
   of engineering design. From a functional perspective, dependability
   assumes satisfying some of the required functions and implies the
   correct definition of them. Thus, in the case of complex equipment,
   multi-variable functions can be generated whose variables are dependent
   on different states and operating modes. In recent years, automated
   continuous design techniques have been developed through intelligent
   computational methodologies to determine the dependability of systems.
   These techniques also introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
   integrity engineering design and offer an overview and modelling in
   designing for reliability, availability, maintainability and system
   security. This paper combines quantitative research, mathematical and
   algorithmic modelling with evolutionary techniques. The combination of
   the four research techniques is done in a coherent application validated
   on a mechanical device and applicable to a wide range of technical
   systems. More specifically, the work proposes a comparative study of
   mathematical - linear and nonlinear models for correlation and
   optimization of maintainability and reliability values in relation to
   production and quality policies. These models will be complemented with
   specific AI techniques: neural and genetic algorithms that validate and
   optimize mathematical models. It identifies the metrics for the
   evaluation of the dependent variables (reliability, maintainability) and
   an independent variables (production and quality), these variables are
   observed over a given time horizon, their mathematical, neural and
   genetic modelling is performed to achieve correlations, optimization
   functions and model validation. The study proves to be a practical and
   applicative tool in the analysis of system integrity in general and
   operational safety, especially with a large generalization capacity on
   systems in many technical fields.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the coupling-model between external magnetic
   fields and induced voltages at the sensing input of the implantable
   medical devices with unipolar and bipolar electrodes. Therefore an
   analytical model has been developed allowing the determination of
   induced voltage into a pacemaker in a magnetic field with low
   frequencies between 10 Hz and 30 kHz. A distinction between left
   pectoral unipolar and bipolar pacemaker electrodes has been made here.
   Furthermore the different positions of a bipolar electrode were taken
   into consideration. It was found that depending on the position of the
   bipolar electrodes in a homogeneous magnetic field, major differences of
   induced voltage occur. The main task of this project is to ascertain the
   influence of electric conductivity on interference voltage in bipolar
   electrodes. The measurement circuit has been placed into an original
   pacemaker case and therefore allowed the comparison between bipolar and
   unipolar electrodes by only mode switching. The magnetic field has been
   generated by a Helmholtz coil. Part of the Helmholtz coil system was a
   model of a human torso filled with saline solution to simulate human
   tissue. The result of the measurements showed a dependency between
   electric conductivity and induced voltage. The extensively discussed
   security factor of bipolar electrodes could be calculated from the
   above-mentioned measurements. The assumed transition in interference
   voltage from bipolar to unipolar electrodes at about 100 kHz has been
   significantly lower in these experiments.},

Title = {Source-Storage-Load Coordinated Master-Slave Control Strategy for
   Islanded Microgrid Considering Load Disturbance and Communication
   Interruption},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 27},
Abstract = {When there is a sudden load disturbance in an islanded microgrid, the
   peer-to-peer control model requires the energy resource to maintain a
   margin of generation, resulting in a relatively limited regulation
   range, that is, voltage/frequency sometimes requires additional control
   to maintain stability. A ``source-storage-load{''} coordinated
   master-slave control strategy is proposed in this study to address the
   aforementioned issues. The system voltage and frequency will be stable
   as long as the output frequency and voltage of the master resource are
   stable. Furthermore, it can fully utilize the power supply capacity of
   resources to support the supply-demand balance. The following tasks are
   included in the proposed strategy: 1) to improve the operational
   security in the face of load disruption, a source-storage-load
   coordinated control method based on the ``ramping speed{''} ratio is
   proposed, which can quickly restore the balance of supply and demand; 2)
   to improve the communication reliability in the face of interruption, a
   channel planning method is proposed, which can address the communication
   interruption problem by constructing an internal network among
   source-storage-load; and 3) to improve the mode switching stability of
   resources subjected to external disturbance, the external disturbance
   suppression and stability analysis involved in the regulation process
   are completed using sliding-mode control and small signal model methods.
   Related case studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed strategies.},

Abstract = {Altarica3.0 is a high-level modeling language for security analysis, and
   its basic mathematical form is Guardian Transformation System (GTS). At
   present, GTS (or Altarica3.0 model) can be compiled into a fault tree or
   critical event sequence. There are several reasons for turning GTS model
   into a fault tree: automatically generating a fault tree from a
   high-level model is easier and less time consuming than creating one
   from scratch; Second, the high level model greatly improves the model
   design, sharing and maintenance; Finally, the evaluation tools of the
   Boolean model are more effective than the state/transition model. In
   general, however, the cost is the loss of sequence between events: the
   sequence of events is compiled into the connection of events, so there
   may be potential omissions throughout the system reliability analysis
   process and analysis results. To remedy this problem, in this paper we
   outline an analysis approach that converts failure behavioural models
   (GTS) to temporal fault trees (TFTs), which can then be analysed using
   Pandora a recent technique for introducing temporal logic to fault
   trees. The approach is compositional and potentially more scalable, as
   it relies on the synthesis of large system TFTs from smaller component
   TFTs. We verify, by using a redundant system, the effectiveness of the
   proposed method.},

Title = {Mitigating information leakage during critical communication using

Abstract = {Security-centric components and systems, such as System-on-Chip
   early-boot communication protocols and ultra-specific lightweight
   devices, require a departure from minimalist design constructs. The need
   for built-in protection mechanisms, at all levels of design, is
   paramount to providing cost-effective, efficient, secure systems. In
   this work, Securely derived Finite State Machines (S{*}FSM) and
   power-aware S{*}FSM are proposed and studied. Overall results show that
   to provide an S{*}FSM, the typical FSM requires a 50\% increase in the
   number of states and a 57\% increase in the number of product terms
   needed to define the state transitions. These increases translate to a
   minimum encoding space increase of 70\%, raising the average encoding
   length from 4.8 bits to 7.9 bits. When factoring in relaxed structural
   constraints for power and space mitigation, the respective increases of
   53 and 67\% raise the average number of bits needed to 7.3 and 7.9.
   Regarding power savings, current minimisation is possible for both FSMs
   and S{*}FSMs through the addition of encoding constraints with average
   current reductions of 30 and 70\%, respectively. Overall, a
   power-constrained S{*}FSM consumes about 5\% more power than insecure
   FSMs with binary encodings, though with a penalty of a 95\% increase in
   layout area.},

Title = {Enhanced Dynamic Stability Control for Low-Inertia Hybrid AC/DC
   Microgrid With Distributed Energy Storage Systems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {91234-91242},
Abstract = {Hybrid ac/dc microgrids (MGs) integrated with traditional diesel
   generators, distributed energy storage systems (ESSs), and high
   penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs)-based distributed
   generators (DGs) have become an attractive power supply solution for
   isolated remote areas and islands, which can effectively reduce
   environmental protection pressure and improve power supply reliability.
   However, in such inherent low-inertia systems, randomness and
   fluctuation of the output power of RESs and uncertain load consumption
   can easily incur dynamic stability issues, such as transient power
   impact, unacceptable frequency deviations, and operation mode
   transitions for security. To solve the above problems and enhance the
   dynamic stability of the system, an enhanced dynamic stability control
   (EDSC) scheme with locally measured signals only is proposed in this
   paper. In this control scheme, the bi-directional interlinking dc-ac
   converter uses the ac frequency in ac MG as the reference value of dc
   voltage and adopts the current feedforward control to control the dc
   voltage in the dc MG to be consistent with the ac frequency. By
   electrically coupling dc voltage and ac frequency, power disturbances in
   ac or dc sides will cause almost identical variation degrees in both ac
   frequency and dc voltage. Under the proposed EDSC scheme, the
   distributed ESSs in both ac and dc sides are then automatically
   coordinated and controlled by the unified droop control to balance
   transient power disturbances and smooth output of diesel generator under
   normal condition, which can effectively improve stability and
   controllability of such low-inertia systems. Furthermore, in an
   emergency such as failure of diesel generator, the operation mode can be
   switched seamlessly with the proposed EDSC scheme. The detailed
   theoretical analysis including control system design, small signal model
   analysis of key parameter influence on system dynamics, and simulation
   verifications in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment is presented to verify the
   effectiveness and practicality of the proposed EDSC scheme.},

Title = {A data-driven approach to anomaly detection and vulnerability dynamic
   analysis for large-scale integrated energy systems},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {234},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {In an integrated energy system (IES), the operating state of each energy
   subsystem changes relatively frequently, which can seriously threaten
   the security of IES operation. A systematic data-driven approach is
   proposed for detecting anomalies and analyzing the dynamics of IES
   vulnerability. Firstly, an anomaly detection method is introduced to
   determine whether there are anomalies in the system operation. The
   method can be set up even if the data labels for discriminating the
   anomalies are unknown, often the cause in practice. Secondly, a method
   of complex network phase theory is proposed to model information
   propagation among IES nodes representative of the IES physical entities.
   Complex network models can then be constructed to describe the system
   behavior in different operating conditions and over different time
   horizons. The degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness
   centrality are used as indications to analyze changes in IES
   vulnerability. Finally, a method is proposed to identify the critical
   points of the IES from the point of view of its vulnerability. The new
   approach is applied to analyze the vulnerability of an IES in Spain. The
   results show that the proposed methods allow revealing system anomalies,
   vulnerability and weaknesses. Outcomes from an analysis by these methods
   can be used by managers to take defensive measures in advance for
   preventing and mitigating the impact of potential factors and threats on
   the IES.},

Abstract = {Digital twin (DT) is a key enabling technology to realize cyber-physical

   and enhance the controllability, security, and information transparency
   of LCEC in the testing process, three key technologies are elaborated in
   detail as follows: (1) the construction of the twin semantic model of
   the testing process in model layer, (2) the synchronization method of
   twin model and physical entity based on real-time data, (3) and
   human-computer interaction-based visual monitoring of authenticity and

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose Time Bounded Anti-Spoofing (TBAS), a novel
   spoof detection method for W-Fi networks. TBAS is based on the simple
   idea of comparing the channel states embedded in packets received within
   a short interval and discarding the packets if the channel state change
   is above a reasonable level for the interval. We leverage the packet
   transmission policies in Wi-Fi to actively elicit packets for the
   channel state check without modifying the Wi-Fi protocol, such as
   sending a dummy data packet which will automatically elicit an
   acknowledgement packet. Comparing to the existing methods that wait
   passively for the packets from the packet sender for the channel state
   information, TBAS has the full control of time to collect the channel
   state, such that it can use stricter rules to classify the packets and
   achieve higher security. We solve key problems in TBAS, including a
   Channel State Check (CSC) procedure which determines if two packets are
   from the same sender, as well as a simple protocol wrapped around CSC to
   reduce the overhead. We implement TBAS on the Sora software defined
   ratio and our trace-driven emulations show that TBAS can achieve
   desirable False Positive and False Negative ratios with very low
   overhead.},

Abstract = {In order to promote the coordinated development of runoff small
   hydropower and the regional distribution network, this paper introduces
   a method for calculating the optimal hosting capacity of runoff small
   hydropower considering adaptive reactive power control. For the purpose
   of improve the security and economy of the operation of the distribution
   network, taking the integrated optimal of operating cost, voltage
   deviation and power loss as the target and adopting multi-state model to
   build a multi-objective model based on chance constrained programming.
   An adaptive reactive power control strategy is employed to solve the
   voltage regulation problem of grid-connected nodes. Moreover,
   non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) based on elitist is
   proposed to solve multi-objective model and technique for order
   preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) based on entropy
   is adopted to choose the optimal solution from Pareto solution set.
   Finally, the simulation results on IEEE 33-bus distribution system
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

   occupancy, weather conditions and consumer preferences. Thus, a proper
   understanding of the available datasets will result in a strong basis
   for improving energy efficiency. Starting from the necessity of a
   comprehensive review of existing databases, this work is proposed to
   survey, study and visualize the numerical and methodological nature of
   building energy consumption datasets. A total of thirty-one databases
   are examined and compared in terms of several features, such as the
   geographical location, period of collection, number of monitored
   households, sampling rate of collected data, number of sub-metered
   appliances, extracted features and release date. Furthermore, data
   collection platforms and related modules for data transmission, data
   storage and privacy concerns used in different datasets are also
   analyzed and compared. Based on the analytical study, a novel dataset
   has been presented, namely Qatar university dataset, which is an
   annotated power consumption anomaly detection dataset. The latter will
   be very useful for testing and training anomaly detection algorithms,
   and hence reducing wasted energy. Moving forward, a set of
   recommendations is derived to improve datasets collection, such as the
   adoption of multi-modal data collection, smart Internet of things data
   collection, low-cost hardware platforms and privacy and security
   mechanisms. In addition, future directions to improve datasets
   exploitation and utilization are identified, including the use of novel
   machine learning solutions, innovative visualization tools and
   explainable mobile recommender systems. Accordingly, a novel
   visualization strategy based on using power consumption micro-moments
   has been presented along with an example of deploying machine learning
   algorithms to classify the micro-moment classes and identify anomalous
   power usage. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Internet of things refers to billions of interconnected devices that are
   generally equipped with sensors and communication devices. How to make
   Internet of things become a smart terminal is an important topic. By
   connecting cloud services, the devices can receive more accurate
   information so as to be applied in people's daily life. However, the
   smart terminal devices access the cloud services via Representational
   State Transfer (RESTful) application programming interfaces, and how the
   cloud server authenticates and authorizes billions of devices is an
   immense challenge. Additionally, individual use of smart terminal
   devices is accompanied by such problems as privacy data or security.
   This article presents a token-based authorization service framework. The
   devices can have a safer access to cloud services through the token.
   Token is released by a third-party authentication center to improve its
   reliability and security and is featured by a high degree of privacy
   that sensitive data are not easily leaked. Furthermore, the token is
   valid only within a period of time or it will not work after the token
   count exceeds the threshold defined by the system, thereby lowering the
   devices' risk of being hacked. The framework proposed in this article is
   applied to medical wearable devices. The advantages of this framework
   are practical and secure which are explained in the experimental
   chapter.},

Title = {SINT: Toward a Blockchain-Based Secure In-Band Network Telemetry
   Architecture},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {2667-2682},
Abstract = {The foundation of network management is to timely, accurately, and
   flexibly monitor the status of a managed network. Recently, In-band
   Network Telemetry (INT) has presented its unique capabilities in
   acquiring the insights of a network and thus has been adopted in many
   production networks. However, less attention was put on the potential
   threats on INT (e.g., the man-in-the-middle attacks, Trojan horse
   injection) that may falsify network measurements resulting in
   catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose a secure INT
   architecture called SINT that can effectively mitigate INT
   vulnerabilities and can be implemented using `chiplet' based multi-modal
   network processors (MNP). SINT adopts blockchain technology into INT, in
   which a network status snapshot acquired via INT is viewed as a block
   and added into a network telemetry blockchain to prevent arbitrary
   access and malicious modification. To minimize the intrusiveness of the
   INT and blockchain operations, SINT is designed to be a lightweight
   protocol and uses improved RAFT consensus mechanisms to reduce its
   network and computing overhead. The design of the chiplet MNP system
   makes SINT highly flexible and adaptive to facilitate INT convergence
   and related blockchain updates. In the SINT architecture, INT tasks and
   blockchain operations are dispatched to different chips to achieve an
   optimal trade-off among measurement accuracy, security requirements, and
   computing resource on the data plane. Experiments and simulations show
   that SINT can alleviate most cyberattacks on INT and retain 97\% of
   bandwidth utilization for other users' normal traffic in a complex
   scenario with 500 nodes. Furthermore, SINT converges the INT results
   quickly and accurately with minor overhead compared to that of the
   state-of-art INT methods.},

Abstract = {This paper considers partially-observed discrete-event systems where
   sensors are associated with events observable to an agent monitoring the
   system. The agent is capable of turning the sensors for events on and
   off dynamically, depending on the trajectory of the system. Reading data
   from the sensors may be costly so it is imperative that their use be
   reduced for reasons such as energy, bandwidth or security. When a sensor
   for an event is on / active any occurrence of the event is detected by
   the agent and is not detected otherwise. The agent may employ different
   sensor activation policies, depending on the task at hand. Sensor
   activation policies are defined over the transitions of a
   state-transition representation of the system. From sensor activation
   policies a map from observed event sequences to sensor activation
   decisions can be computed which the agent can use to determine which
   sensors to turn on / off and when. In this paper, we consider a subclass
   of sensor activation policies. For this subclass, we demonstrate a way
   to compute maps from observed event sequences to sensor activation
   decisions in polynomial time. However, we demonstrate that verifying if
   an arbitrary sensor activation policy belongs to this subclass is
   PSPACE-complete.},

Abstract = {Australian capital cities are forecast to face decreased average annual
   rainfall by 2030 under mid-emissions climate scenarios. With two-thirds
   of Australia's population already residing in these growing major
   cities, urban water resources pressure will undoubtedly increase in the
   years ahead. Methods to augment traditional reservoir based water supply
   will be required to maintain water security.
   Internally plumbed rain water tank systems (IPRWTs), supplying water at
   a decentralised level, are one potential alternate supply source.
   Incentive schemes and legislation have seen IPRWTs become increasingly
   prevalent in metropolitan areas since widespread drought from 2000-2009.
   For example in Queensland water savings targets were mandated for all
   newly constructed homes. The most common means of meeting these targets
   was through the use of IPRWTs, which when installed were required to
   supply garden irrigation, clothes-washers and cistern flush events.
   Studies to date have been focused on maximising potable savings, such
   that little research has investigated the energy intensity and
   greenhouse gas emissions associated with the operation of IPRWTs. This
   is a worthy consideration given that they are typically thought of as
   green, sustainable solutions.
   This paper examines the energy intensity and greenhouse gas cost of
   IPRWTs under a number of modelled usage scenarios, utilising
   high-resolution end-use level data from a recently conducted IPRWT
   monitoring study in South East Queensland. This modelling, facilitated
   through the use of specialised software, MATLAB and spread-sheet
   software, has determined the average annual energy consumption of
   IPRWTs, taking into account the effect of climatic conditions on water
   consumption. This energy consumption leads to electricity and carbon
   based costs to homeowners and the general community, which have been
   quantified at an end-use level.
   In the interests of system optimisation, the net economic and
   environmental impacts of configuration changes to IPRWTs have been
   considered, such as not plumbing in toilet cisterns. For standard 2.8
   person households preliminary evidence indicates that based only on
   operational costs, more end-uses are preferable, due to higher yields.
   However, when plumbing and environmental costs are taken into account it
   has been found that it may be worthwhile to plumb in only the most
   energy efficient rainwater end-uses (irrigation and clothes washing).
   For larger households, or those consuming large volumes of water in
   regular irrigation, energy intensity of water supply can be
   significantly lowered by only plumbing in efficient end-uses, while
   yearly water savings (from avoided mains costs) fall only by a small
   margin. For retrofitters and new home builders the extra cost incurred
   when plumbing in toilet cisterns to rainwater supply should be
   considered. Existing system owners should note the large increase in
   system energy intensity when small leaks develop from poor maintenance,
   usually from toilet cisterns, as this can lead to significantly greater
   economic and environmental costs over the lifetime of a rainwater system
   and reduce the viability of cistern end-uses.},

Title = {Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection System in RPL by Applying Stochastic
   and Evolutionary Game Models over IoT Environment},

Abstract = {The rapid development of Information and Communication Technology and
   the growing number of devices connected to the Internet make the
   Internet of Things (IoT) as a promising technology for a new breed of
   applications. The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks
   (RPL) is a widely applied open standard protocol for IoT networks. The
   RPL routing is highly vulnerable to routing attacks due to the
   constrained nodes. The attacks on the RPL aim to disrupt the optimal
   protocol structure and significantly deteriorating network performance.
   Secure RPL routing schemes attempt to derive a high-level abstract of
   RPL operations through network simulation traces and apply it as a
   reference to differentiate the malicious behavior. The RPL
   specifications include all the states and transitions with its
   corresponding statistics. However, the malicious activities around a
   node enforce it to initiate the unnecessary state transition, and thus,
   the legitimate nodes are equally treated as malicious in dynamic IoT
   network scenarios. Hence, this work proposes a game theoretic model
   based anomaly Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect the RPL attacks
   and verify and confirm their malicious activities. This study formulates
   the Game models based Anomaly Intrusion Detection System (GAIDS) for RPL
   security. The proposed approach consists of two interrelated
   formulations, such as a stochastic game for attack detection and
   evolutionary game for attack confirmation. The stochastic game model
   formulates the activities of the standard RPL rules as a zero-sum
   stochastic game. The stochastic game estimates the payoff by observing
   the states, transitions between them, and their statistics. However,
   there is a possibility to model legitimate players as malicious, due to
   the nature of RPL. Thus, the proposed GAIDS scheme implements the
   evolutionary game theoretic framework on clustered network topology for
   the attack verification. By synchronizing the results of the stochastic
   game of neighboring players, it differentiates the legitimate players
   from the suspected list successfully. As a result, the GAIDS isolates
   the detected attackers and maintains the routing performance. The
   simulation results demonstrate that the detection accuracy and
   throughput of the proposed gaming model based anomaly IDS is
   substantially high and outperforms the existing scheme.},

Abstract = {Radio Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) is the technique which
   identifies the individual radio emitter based on the received signals'
   specific properties called signals' Radio Frequency Fingerprint (RFF).
   SEI is very significant for improving the security of wireless networks.
   A novel SEI method which treats the emitter as a nonlinear dynamical
   system is proposed in this paper. The method works based on the signal's
   nonlinear characteristics which result from the unintentional and
   unavoidable physical-layer imperfections. The reconstructed phase space
   (RPS) is used as the tool for analyzing the nonlinearity. The entire
   characteristics of RPS and state changes characteristics of points in
   RPS are extracted to form RFF. To evaluate the availability of the RFF,
   the signals from four wireless network cards are collected by a signal
   acquisition system. The proposed RFF's discrimination capabilities are
   visually analyzed using the boxplot. The results of visual analysis and
   classification demonstrate that this method is effective.},

Abstract = {Cyber-Physical Energy systems (CPEs) are highly connected and remotely
   controlled systems for energy production, transmission and distribution.
   Failures of CPEs can occur in both their cyber and physical parts and
   may, in both cases, result in significant economic losses, service
   interruption and, even threats to the environment and the population.
   Traditionally, safety and security of CPEs are addressed separately, the
   former dealing with failures in the physical part, the latter with
   breaches in the cyber part. While physical aging is often accounted for,
   it is not for the cyber elements although it may have an impact on CPEs
   controllability, stability and, ultimately, reliability. In this paper,
   we propose a dynamic reliability assessment framework that embeds a
   multi-state cyber aging model of literature into a Goal Tree Success
   Tree-Master Logic Diagram (GTST-MLD) that accounts for both stochastic
   hardware components failures and cyber aging that may open breaches for
   cyber attacks to the control system. The digital Instrumentation and
   Control (I\&C) system of the Advanced Lead-cooled Fast Reactor European
   Demonstrator (ALFRED) is considered as an example to show the
   applicability of the GTST-MLD based dynamic reliability assessment
   method proposed.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {Progress in Microgrid (MG) research has evolved the MG concept from
   classical, purely MG power networks to more advanced power and
   communications networks. The communications infrastructure helps control
   and manage the unreliable power outputs that most standard power
   generation elements of the MG (e.g., wind turbines and photo-voltaic
   panels) deliver. Although communication technologies do offer certain
   advantages for sensing and control, they generate other complications
   due to packet loss and packet latency, among other transmission
   impairments. In this work, we discuss the impact of communications on MG
   performance, establishing the requirements of data exchanges and system
   response in the three levels of a hierarchical control approach:
   primary, secondary, and tertiary. With a focus on the secondary level -
   responsible for ensuring the restoration of electrical parameters - we
   identify standards, networking protocols, and communication technologies
   relevant for the interoperability of MGs and clusters of MGs, including
   both modes of operation: isolated and grid-connected. We review
   theoretical approaches and practical implementations that consider the
   effects of the communications network on the general performance of the
   MG. Moreover, we undertake an experimental analysis of the influence of
   wired and wireless communication networks on MG performance, revealing
   the importance of designing future smart control solutions more robust
   to communication degradation, especially if wireless technologies are
   integrated to provide scalable deployments. Aspects such as resilience,
   security, and interoperability are also shown to require continuing
   efforts in research and practical applications.},

Abstract = {Grid restoration strategies gain in significance since fundamental
   changes inside electrical power grids are in progress. The share in
   volatile energy sources connected through power electronic components
   increases, whereas the installed power of grid-connected generators and
   associated inertia decreases. In this context, critical operating states
   up to system blackouts, that threaten the security of supply and the
   access to electical energy, might occur.
   In order to restore the grid after a blackout in an efficient way, this
   paper proposes an advanced control concept for high voltage direct
   current (HVDC) systems using voltage source converters (VSC) in
   gridforming mode. VSC-HVDC systems open new restoration paths and offer
   the possibility to involve healthy grid areas form a far distance to
   take part in the restoration process. To benefit from the potential of
   renewable energy sources and energy storage devices to support the
   process, established restoration strategies are extended by the
   consistent integration of power electronics and intelligent control
   schemes.
   The presented model predictive controller (MPC) enables precise voltage
   reference tracking inside the restoration area to ensure a grid
   compatible voltage ramp-up process by avoiding undesireable effects, e.
   g. inrush phenomena of transformers. Moreover, the grid frequency is
   used as a system-wide parameter that is used as a physical information
   channel between the grid-forming VSC-HVDC station and further power
   converters inside the restoration area. In that way, renewable energy
   sources and storage devices can contribute to speed up the restoration
   process while guaranteeing system stability.},

Abstract = {The emerging energy crisis resulting from a high price of crude oil has
   drawn attention about renewable energy all over the world. Thailand is a
   developing country located at the heart of Southeast Asia, with about 66
   million of population as of 2006. The electricity supply industry
   structure under the government of Thailand has been managed by the
   Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, the Metropolitan
   Electricity Authority, and the Provincial Electricity Authority for
   almost 50 years. According to the 2004 Power Development Plan, the
   country would have generation reserve at a marginal of 15\%. Due to the
   rapid economic growth and difficulty in building new centralized
   generating facilities, this has the potential to create a security issue
   of electricity energy shortage and may develop a severe system blackout.
   Renewable energy issues have been widely discussed and debated over the
   country. Although solar energy is the most prominent renewable energy
   source due to the appropriate geographic of Thailand, it is still
   considered as a low-density energy source which requires a large area of
   installation. Therefore, for the long-term investment, wind power seems
   to be a good candidate because it is quick to install, needs no fuel
   cost, and is environment friendly. Therefore, this paper investigates
   the impact of the penetration level of wind power generation to be
   integrated into the Thailand system. System stability has been observed
   in various system configuration changes due to different control
   strategies of wind farms. The economic analysis of wind-farm investment
   has been also considered.},

Abstract = {The paper will discuss two installed system designs and methods used to
   transmit a DTT signal over cellular systems.
   This new approach solves the communication reliability problems and
   addresses application security.
   This paper is a case study of 3 installed DTT systems that use cellular
   communication - one system at Central Virginia Electric Cooperative and
   two at Dominion Energy. In this paper the authors will report on the
   design, implementation, performance and issues encountered during and
   post project execution. These intelligent DTT systems have been designed
   to increase availability of the DG by preventing the indiscriminate
   disconnection of the sites. Traditionally Direct Transfer Trip Signals
   (DTT) has been sent between substations and remote Distributed
   Generation (DG) sites using leased telephone lines. If DTT communication
   is interrupted, the DTT system will disconnect the DG site. Leased
   copper lines are becoming less reliable, leading to unwanted
   disconnection of DG sites. Installation of fiber is not always feasible
   due to the cost. This paper will discuss an approach to provide DTT
   signals using wireless communications. The paper will address the
   security concerns that many Utilities might face. Two new innovations to
   increase the DG site's availability will be discussed.
   1) Automatic Direct Transfer Close
   If system conditions return to normal after a DTT event, the system will
   automatically close the DG site back in onto the feeder.
   2) Dynamic Feeder State change protection function.
   Using cellular or wireless communication systems it must be expected
   that there will be communication interruptions during normal maintenance
   actions. During these times the DG site device activates a new
   protection function that will detect any anomalies that could constitute
   a change in the connected feeder systems (e.g. caused by a fault or the
   opening of a breaker) and then only disconnect the DG site.},

Abstract = {Service-oriented architecture provides interoperability and weak
   coupling features for software development. Representational state
   transfer (REST) is an architectural style that has attracted attention
   in the SOA domain as it allows the development of Web services based on
   original principles of the World Wide Web. Unlike Web service
   specifications, which are based on Simple Object Access Protocol and Web
   Services Description Language, REST does not provide official' standards
   to address non-functional requirements of services, such as security,
   reliability, and transaction control. The timestamp-based two-phase
   commit protocol for RESTful service (TS2PC4RS) algorithm specifies
   concurrency control of RESTful services during a transaction. An
   extension of the TS2PC4RS specifies the concurrency control of the Web
   services considering the update operation to meet some business rules.
   However, neither algorithm addresses transaction control when failures
   occur. In long-term transactions, failures can occur and compromise the
   success of Web service applications. Two common failures traditionally
   considered in the analysis of protocols are host and connection
   failures. The aim of this paper is to address fault tolerance for
   TS2PC4RS and its extension. A fault-tolerant protocol based on timeout
   and log records is proposed. The fault-tolerant protocol provides
   support for the host and connection failures that may occur during a
   transaction execution. The fault-tolerant mechanisms are used to meet
   the application domain business rules that guide the behavior of RESTful
   services. We describe the protocol using scenarios when failures occur.

Abstract = {Traditional desktop delivery model is based on a large number of
   distributed PCs executing operating system and desktop applications.
   Managing traditional desktop environments is incredibly challenging and
   costly. Tasks like installations, configuration changes, security
   measures require time-consuming procedures and dedicated deskside
   support. Also these distributed desktops are typically underutilized,
   resulting in low ROI for these assets. Further, this distributed
   computing model for desktops also creates a security concern as
   sensitive information could be compromised with stolen laptops or PCs.
   Desktop virtualization, which moves computation to the data center,
   allows users to access their applications and data using stateless
   ``thin-client{''} devices and therefore alleviates some of the problems
   of traditional desktop computing. Enterprises can now leverage the
   flexibility and cost-benefits of running users' desktops on virtual
   machines hosted at the data center to enhance business agility and
   reduce business risks, while lowering TCO. Recent research and
   development of cloud computing paradigm opens new possibilities of mass
   hosting of desktops and providing them as a service.
   However, transformation of legacy systems to desktop clouds as well as
   proper capacity provisioning is a challenging problem. Desktop cloud
   needs to be appropriately designed and provisioned to offer low response
   time and good working experience to desktop users while optimizing
   back-end resource usage and therefore minimizing provider's costs. This
   paper presents tools and approaches we have developed to facilitate fast
   and accurate planning for desktop clouds. We present desktop workload
   profiling and benchmarking tools as well as desktop to cloud
   transformation process enabling fast and accurate transition of legacy
   systems to new cloud-based model.},

Title = {An algebraic attack to the Bluetooth stream cipher E0},
Journal = {FINITE FIELDS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {84},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this paper we study the security of the Bluetooth stream cipher E0
   from the viewpoint it is a ``difference stream cipher{''}, that is, it
   is defined by a system of explicit difference equations over the finite
   field GF(2). This approach highlights some issues of the Bluetooth
   encryption such as the invertibility of its state transition map, a
   special set of 14 bits of its 132-bit state which when guessed implies
   linear equations among the other bits and finally a small number of
   spurious keys, with 83 guessed bits, which are compatible with a
   keystream of about 60 bits. Exploiting these issues, we implement an
   algebraic attack using Grobner bases, SAT solvers and Binary Decision
   Diagrams. Testing activities suggest that the version based on Grobner
   bases is the best one and it is able to attack E0 in about 279 seconds
   on an Intel i9 CPU. To the best of our knowledge, this work improves any
   previous attack based on a short keystream, hence fitting with Bluetooth
   specifications. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An online tripping index to improve microgrid dynamic stability based on
   estimating critical boundary area},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {27},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper presents an online index for adaptive protection of
   microgrids concerning the low inertia concept. A three-step approach is
   developed to consider two offline and online environments, and the
   proposed scheme is designed. In Step-1, a comprehensive study of the
   microgrid dynamical model is investigated through two different
   distributed energy resources (DERs), including generator-based and
   inverter-based resources. In this step, based on the low-inertia
   concept, a dynamical model of an adaptive protection scheme is proposed
   through a set of non-model-based indexes. In Step-2, considering online
   evaluations of produced indexes, two different equations are provided in
   the form activation point and triggering point which the corresponding
   adaptive protective zones are provided. In this step, considering
   different operational and topological points of microgrid, the
   protective abilities of proposed indexes are validated and reorganized.
   Finally Step-3 concentrates on the ability of the proposed defensive
   scheme in real-time operating mode. In this step, considering different
   fault scenarios, the accuracy estimation and fast detection of the
   developed protection scheme are investigated, and the microgrid dynamic
   security is evaluated. Results present the effectuality of the proposed
   scheme to fast and secure detection of unstable scenarios using adaptive
   non-model-based signals concerning different system structures. (C) 2021

Abstract = {Successfully employed in the industry, hardware isolation environment
   enhances the access control of traditional operating systems and
   requires more rigorous analysis. This paper first applies the B method
   to the access control mechanism formalization and proposes an extensible
   formal model, which not only specifies the access control mechanism with
   process state transition in Linux, but also introduces the hardware
   isolation description. Consistent with program implementations, the B
   specifications can be animated and verified. The proposed B model
   constructs a mathematical framework for the security analysis, providing
   a theoretical support for mechanism enhancements. All the model
   components are type checked by Atelier B, with 547 proof obligations
   automatically generated. The current rate of model proof is 79\%. The
   experimental results by ProB show that there is no invariant violation
   or deadlock. In conclusion, this paper presents a feasible solution for
   access control mechanism formalization and verification in the embedded
   system design. The access control model can be further extended and
   refined, with its specifications transformed into executable codes after

Title = {Real-time tracking of electromechanical oscillations in ENTSO-e
   Continental European Synchronous Area},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {64},

Abstract = {Small signal stability is a crucial aspect of accurately keeping control
   in modern interconnected power systems, in order to ensure the required
   security and reliability standards. Such an aspect could represent a
   serious limiting factor in the search for ever higher power system
   exploitation levels. Hence, in order to exploit the existing networks as
   much as possible, ensuring at the same time adequate security levels,
   the system operators must monitor the electromechanical oscillations
   continuously, estimating their fundamental parameters (e.g. frequency,
   damping factor/ratio, amplitude and phase), and determining the actual
   dynamic stability margins. Nowadays, electromechanical oscillations
   tracking can be performed in real time thanks to the quick development
   of wide area measurement/monitoring systems, and the employment of
   so-called measurement-based methods (a.k.a. mode meters). In this
   regard, the paper presents a performance comparison among several
   measurement-based methods currently operating on the Italian Wide Area
   Monitoring (WAM) platform. The main objective of this investigation is
   to analyze the behavior of each of them with respect to actual
   critical/not critical electromechanical oscillations recorded on the
   European Network Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-e)
   Continental Synchronous European System (CESA). The considered case
   studies cover a large variety of situations that can be encountered in
   the ordinary ENTSO-e CESA operation: local and inter-area oscillations;
   single mode and multi-mode power signals; ambient and ringdown data; and
   so on. By keeping in mind that usually no best estimator exists, owing
   to the lack of an optimality definition, the present analysis aims at
   examining whether some algorithms are generally more suitable than
   others, with respect to the variety of aforementioned situations. In
   detail, the measurement-based methods considered in this work are the
   Tufts-Kumaresan method, Hankel Singular Value Decomposition-VarPRO,
   Hilbert-Huang Transform, its refined Empirical Mode Decomposition with
   Fourier-Based Masking Technique (R-EMD), and a recently published
   Hilbert Transform-based estimation algorithm. Obviously, this set of
   estimation techniques cannot be considered exhaustive for the research
   problem under analysis. Nonetheless, it represents a collection of the
   major, recent and most fashionable methodologies implemented in actual
   WAM architectures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Model for Risk Calculation and Reliability Comparison of Level Crossings},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {There is not a single country in the world that is so rich that it can
   remove all level crossings or provide their denivelation in order to
   absolutely avoid the possibility of accidents at the intersections of
   railways and road traffic. In the Republic of Serbia alone, the largest
   number of accidents occur at passive crossings, which make up
   three-quarters of the total number of crossings. Therefore, it is
   necessary to constantly find solutions to the problem of priorities when
   choosing level crossings where it is necessary to raise the level of
   security, primarily by analyzing the risk and reliability at all level
   crossings. This paper presents a model that enables this. The
   calculation of the maximal risk of a level crossing is achieved under
   the conditions of generating the maximum entropy in the virtual
   operating mode. The basis of the model is a heterogeneous queuing
   system. Maximum entropy is based on the mandatory application of an
   exponential distribution. The system is Markovian and is solved by a
   standard analytical concept. The basic input parameters for the
   calculation of the maximal risk are the geometric characteristics of the
   level crossing and the intensities and structure of the flows of road
   and railway vehicles. The real risk is based on statistical records of
   accidents and flow intensities. The exact reliability of the level
   crossing is calculated from the ratio of real and maximal risk, which
   enables their further comparison in order to raise the level of safety,
   and that is the basic idea of this paper.},

Abstract = {Standard environments for exploiting idle time of workstations are based
   on some kind of spying process that detects low CPU usage and informs to
   a scheduler so that work can be dispatched. This approach generates
   local interference and, since the same local environment is used, could
   lead to security problems. We are investigating the exploitation of idle
   times in network resources based on a complete mode change in a
   candidate node. After the detection that some node is idle, a
   Mode-Switcher boots a new operating system that will work over a
   separate disk partition. After the boot phase the node is linked to a
   logical network topology and is available to receive jobs. Users can
   allocate nodes from this virtual cluster through a standard front-end as
   they would do in a ``conventional{''} cluster. Because nodes may leave
   and join this virtual machine we use a distributed processor management
   to allow user applications to cope with this dynamic resource behavior.
   In this paper we describe the architecture of the virtual cluster and
   present the results obtained with a Mode-Switcher and a prototype
   application under real use conditions.},

Title = {Evaluation of Voltage Fluctuations Effect on Reconfiguration of
   Distribution Systems},
Journal = {IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUN 1},
Abstract = {Distribution system operators seriously restrict bus voltage deviations
   within a small range from the nominal voltage to ensure security
   aspects. The distribution network reconfiguration technique is often
   performed to improve these voltage levels, if not to reduce power
   losses. However, distribution systems feed various kinds of consumers,
   and their power demand dependency on bus voltages is different based on
   their load type. Modifying the network configuration changes the
   system's nodal voltage levels, and then the load power is also impacted
   after the reconfiguration. Only a few research works in the field of
   distribution system reconfiguration have included load power dependency
   to nodal voltages in their proposed models. However, these studies have
   not discussed whether adding voltage-depend loads to the reconfiguration
   problem is beneficial or only increases the computational efforts
   without substantial gains on the optimal solution. With the intention to
   fill this gap, this article develops a comprehensive analysis of how the
   change of load according to the voltage affects reconfiguration
   solutions. This investigation aims to help distribution system
   researchers and readers understand this phenomenon and highlight the
   benefits and drawbacks of taking it into account. Also, a robust
   reconfiguration model for considering load types and nodal voltage is
   proposed. The model is validated in different network models and sizes,
   where the obtained results are compared with other models presented in
   the literature. The results analysis indicates that voltage fluctuations
   impact the distribution network configuration through voltage effect on
   power losses and the system nodal loads. Also, load voltage-dependent
   models are more flexible than constant demand based-formulations in
   finding feasible solutions in more restricted voltage tolerances.},

Abstract = {The accuracy of wind power prediction is important for assessing the
   security and economy of the system operation when wind power connects to
   the grids. However, multiple factors cause a long delay and large errors
   in wind power prediction. Hence, efficient wind power forecasting
   approaches are still required for practical applications. In this paper,
   a new wind power forecasting method based on Chaos Theory and Bernstein
   Neural Network (BNN) is proposed. Firstly, the largest Lyapunov exponent
   as a judgment for wind power system's chaotic behavior is made.
   Secondly, Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR) is used to reconstruct the
   wind power series' phase space. Thirdly, the prediction model is
   constructed using the Bernstein polynomial and neural network. Finally,
   the weights and thresholds of the model are optimized by Primal Dual
   State Transition Algorithm (PDSTA). The practical hourly data of wind
   power generation in Xinjiang is used to test this forecaster. The
   proposed forecaster is compared with several current prominent research
   findings. Analytical results indicate that the forecasting error of
   PDSTA BNN is 3.893\% for 24 look-ahead hours, and has lower errors
   obtained compared with the other forecast methods discussed in this
   paper. The results of all cases studying confirm the validity of the new
   forecast method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   Blockchain Solution for Decentralized Applications},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of blockchain, the concept of decentralized
   applications (DApps), built upon smart contracts, has attracted much
   attention in academia and industry. However, significant issues w.r.t.
   system throughput, transaction confidentiality, and the security
   guarantee of the DApp transaction execution and order correctness hinder
   the border adoption of blockchain DApps.
   To address these issues, we propose L2chain, a novel blockchain
   framework aiming to scale the system through a layer-2 network where
   DApps process transactions in the layer-2 network and only the system
   state digest, acting as the state integrity proof, is maintained
   on-chain. To achieve high performance, we introduce the
   split-execute-merge (SEM) transaction processing workflow with the help
   of the RSA accumulator, allowing DApps to lock and update a part of the
   state digest in parallel. We also design a witness cache mechanism for
   DApp executors to reduce the transaction processing latency. To fulfill
   confidentiality, we leverage the trusted execution environment (TEE) for
   DApps to execute encrypted transactions off-chain. To ensure transaction
   execution and order correctness, we propose a two-step execution process
   for DApps to prevent attacks (i.e., rollback attacks) from subverting
   the state transition. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that
   L2chain can achieve 1.5X to 42.2X and 7.1X to 8.9X throughput
   improvements in permissioned and permissionless settings respectively.},

Abstract = {Classified information protection is regulated by dedicated acts and
   related laws that require use of necessary physical, personal,
   information and communication technologies, electromagnetic and
   cryptographic security measures. Equipment and tools for cryptographic
   protection of classified information should be examined and assessed by
   the designated government services. Certificates issued by these
   services authorize the use of cryptographic devices to protect
   classified information, but this is not a sufficient condition. Each ICT
   system intended for processing classified information is subject to
   accreditation. All this makes the process of reaching the right level of
   protection for this type of information long and expensive - especially
   if this protection should be effectively provided in the battlefield.
   Additional specific requirements are put on information protection
   measures for radio communication, especially military, where radio
   transmission is characterized by uncertainty of establishing and
   maintaining connections, bit rates are lower than in cable or fiber
   optic connections, most often there is no full duplex. All this has an
   impact on the methods of cryptographic synchronization and
   implementation of cryptographic functions. A different approach to
   information protection is required by classic narrowband radio
   communications, a different one in time-division multi-access mode, and
   another one in broadband packet data transmission. Systems designed for
   the protection of classified information in radio communications
   implement appropriate operating modes of operation for cryptographic
   algorithms and protocols. Latest threats from quantum computers pose new
   challenges to the cryptographic protection, especially in systems using
   public key cryptography, because there are algorithms that can be used
   to attack public-key schemes with polynomial complexity.},

Abstract = {The immutable feature of blockchain determines that traditional security
   response mechanisms (e.g., code patching) must change to remedy insecure
   smart contracts. The only proper way to protect a smart contract is to
   fix potential risks in its code before it is deployed to the blockchain.
   However, existing tools for smart contract security analysis focus on
   the detection of bugs but seldom consider the code fix issues.
   Meanwhile, it is often time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to
   understand and fix flawed code manually. In this paper we propose SMART
   SHIELD, a bytecode rectification system, to fix three typical
   security-related bugs (i.e., state changes after external calls, missing
   checks for out-of-bound arithmetic operations, and missing checks for
   failing external calls) in smart contracts automatically and help
   developers release secure contracts. Moreover, SMART SHIELD guarantees
   that the rectified contract is not only immune to certain attacks but
   also gas-friendly (i.e., a slightly increase of gas cost). To evaluate
   the effectiveness and efficiency of SMART SHIELD, we applied it to
   28,621 real-world buggy contracts on Ethereum blockchain (as of January
   2nd 2019). Experiment results demonstrated that among 95,502 insecure
   cases in those contracts, 87,346 (91.5\%) of them were automatically
   fixed by SMART SHIELD. A following test with both program analysis and
   real-world exploits further testified that the rectified contracts were
   secure against common attacks. Moreover, the rectification only
   introduced a 0.2\% gas increment for each contract on average.},

Title = {A Continuation Power Flow Model of Multi-Area AC/DC Interconnected Bulk
   Systems Incorporating Voltage Source Converter-Based Multi-Terminal DC
   Networks and Its Decoupling Algorithm},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Existing continuation power flow (CPF) models mainly focus on the
   regional independent systems, which are not suitable for multi-area
   AC/DC interconnected systems because the market trading behaviors and
   security control for power allocation of tie-lines are ignored. This
   study presents a novel CPF model and its decoupling algorithm for
   multi-area AC/DC interconnected systems incorporating a voltage source
   converter (VSC)-based multi-terminal direct current (MTDC) network. This
   CPF model includes the following unique features: (1) In view of the
   bilateral power trading contracts among regional subsystems, the
   nonlinear constraint equations of directional trading active power via
   interface are derived, and the multi-balancing machine strategy is
   introduced to realize the active power balance of each subsystem. (2) An
   accurate simulation method for the security control behaviors of the
   power allocation in tie-lines is proposed, which includes a specific
   selection strategy for automatic generation control units and a
   generation re-dispatch strategy. These two strategies work together to
   prevent the serious overload in tie-lines during load growth and improve
   the voltage stability margin of the interconnected bulk systems. (3) The
   switching characteristic of reactive power control behaviors of VSC
   stations is simulated in the CPF calculation. In the end, a novel
   decoupling CPF algorithm based on bi-directional iteration is presented
   to realize the decomposition and coordination calculation. This
   decoupling algorithm preserves the precision and convergence of
   integrated CPF algorithms, and it has an apparent advantage on the
   calculation speed. Furthermore, this decoupling algorithm also can
   easily reflects the effects of the control mode changes of VSC stations
   to the voltage stability margin of AC system. Case studies and
   comparative analysis on the IEEE two-area RTS-96 system indicate the
   effectiveness and validity of the proposed CPF model and corresponding
   decoupling algorithm.},

Abstract = {Speculative execution, the base on which modern high-performance
   general-purpose CPUs are built on, has recently been shown to enable a
   slew of security attacks. All these attacks are centered around a common
   set of behaviors: During speculative execution, the architectural state
   of the system is kept unmodified, until the speculation can be verified.
   In the event that a misspeculation occurs, then anything that can affect
   the architectural state is reverted (squashed) and re-executed
   correctly. However, the same is not true for the microarchitectural
   state. Normally invisible to the user, changes to the microarchitectural
   state can be observed through various side-channels, with timing
   differences caused by the memory hierarchy being one of the most common
   and easy to exploit. The speculative side-channels can then be exploited
   to perform attacks that can bypass software and hardware checks in order
   to leak information. These attacks, out of which the most infamous are
   perhaps Spectre and Meltdown, have led to a frantic search for
   solutions.
   In this work, we present our own solution for reducing the
   microarchitectural state-changes caused by speculative execution in the
   memory hierarchy. It is based on the observation that if we only allow
   accesses that hit in the L1 data cache to proceed, then we can easily
   hide any microarchitectural changes until after the speculation has been
   verified. At the same time, we propose to prevent stalls by value
   predicting the loads that miss in the L1. Value prediction, though
   speculative, constitutes an invisible form of speculation, not seen
   outside the core. We evaluate our solution and show that we can prevent
   observable microarchitectural changes in the memory hierarchy while
   keeping the performance and energy costs at 11\% and 7\%, respectively.
   In comparison, the current state of the art solution, InvisiSpec, incurs
   a 46\% performance loss and a 51\% energy increase.},

Title = {Prediction and forewarning of axial force of steel bracing in foundation
   pit based on verhulst model},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {The axial force of steel bracing is one of the essential indexes to
   measure the stability of the bracing system of a foundation pit. The
   steel bracing system of a foundation pit in Ningbo City, China was taken
   as the research object to guarantee the stability of the steel bracing
   system of the foundation pit. Besides, the change of axial force between
   the two steel bracing structures was analyzed to predict the axial force
   data of the steel bracing and perform the safety forewarning of the
   steel bracing system. Firstly, GM (1,1) and Verhulst models in the gray
   model were selected for prediction based on the characteristics of poor
   information and the small sample size of original monitoring data of the
   steel bracing. Secondly, the precision of the GM (1,1) model and
   Verhulst model was compared to determine a more accurate prediction
   method. Finally, the safety forewarning model of the confidence interval
   estimation method was established based on the data obtained from the
   prediction model and the deformation characteristics and indexes of the
   steel bracing. With the significance levels alpha = 5\% and alpha = 2\%
   as the demarcating points, the forewarning grades of the steel bracing
   system of the deep foundation pit were divided, and then the operating
   state of the current steel bracing system was determined. The results
   demonstrated that the Verhulst model had better prediction precision
   compared with the ordinary GM (1, 1) model. Besides, the steel bracing
   system was in the safe operation range, and the judgment results of the
   model were consistent with the actual situation of the foundation pit of
   the steel bracing system. Thus, the Verhulst prediction model and the
   confidence interval security early forewarning model could be used to
   judge the stability of the steel bracing system.},

Abstract = {A finite state machine (FSM) is responsible for controlling the overall
   functionality of most digital systems and, therefore, the security of
   the whole system can be compromised if there are vulnerabilities in the
   FSM. These vulnerabilities can be created by improper designs or by the
   synthesis tool which introduces additional don't-care states and
   transitions during the optimization and synthesis process. An attacker
   can utilize these vulnerabilities to perform fault injection attacks or
   insert malicious hardware modifications (Trojan) to gain unauthorized
   access to some specific states. To our knowledge, no systematic
   approaches have been proposed to analyze these vulnerabilities in FSM.
   In this paper, we develop a framework named Analyzing Vulnerabilities in
   FSM (AVFSM) which extracts the state transition graph (including the
   don't-care states and transitions) from a gate-level netlist using a
   novel Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) based approach and
   quantifies the vulnerabilities of the design to fault injection and
   hardware Trojan insertion. We demonstrate the applicability of the AVFSM
   framework by analyzing the vulnerabilities in the FSM of AES and RSA
   encryption module. We also propose a low-cost mitigation technique to
   make FSM more secure against these attacks.},

Title = {Identification of damage in composite structures using Gaussian mixture
   model-processed Lamb waves},
Journal = {SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Composite materials have comprehensively better properties than
   traditional materials, and therefore have been more and more widely
   used, especially because of its higher strength-weight ratio. However,
   the damage of composite structures is usually varied and complicated. In
   order to ensure the security of these structures, it is necessary to
   monitor and distinguish the structural damage in a timely manner. Lamb
   wave-based structural health monitoring (SHM) has been proved to be
   effective in online structural damage detection and evaluation;
   furthermore, the characteristic parameters of the multi-mode Lamb wave
   varies in response to different types of damage in the composite
   material. This paper studies the damage identification approach for
   composite structures using the Lamb wave and the Gaussian mixture model
   (GMM). The algorithm and principle of the GMM, and the parameter
   estimation, is introduced. Multistatistical characteristic parameters of
   the excited Lamb waves are extracted, and the parameter space with
   reduced dimensions is adopted by principal component analysis (PCA). The
   damage identification system using the GMM is then established through
   training. Experiments on a glass fiber-reinforced epoxy composite
   laminate plate are conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed
   approach in terms of damage classification. The experimental results
   show that different types of damage can be identified according to the
   value of the likelihood function of the GMM.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Featured Application Blockchain-powered IoT Applications, such as
   agricultural applications, logistics, and smart factory data management.
   Blockchain network architecture is a promising technology for
   constructing highly secure Internet of Things (IoT) networks. IoT
   networks typically comprise various sensors and actuators. Blockchain
   network technology can be applied to secure control robots in smart
   factories or reliable drone deliveries in smart cities. The wide spread
   of transactions and shared smart contracts across blockchain networks
   guarantees ultimate network security. A typical wired blockchain network
   maintains sufficient redundancy within a stable configuration. However,
   IoT blockchain networks exhibit unavoidable instability. The dynamic
   configuration changes caused by flexible node membership make it
   impossible to achieve the same level of redundancy as a stable network.
   A trustworthy transaction spreading method provides practical
   transaction sharing for dynamic IoT networks. We propose a Q-learning
   framework and a graph convergence network (GCN) to search for the proper
   spreading path of each transaction. The proposed Q-learning framework
   determines the next spreading hop using node features. The GCN
   determines the reliable area based on the Q-learning results. The
   discovered reliable area guides the proper spreading path of
   transactions to the destination node. In addition, the proposed
   trustworthy transaction spreading was implemented over an InterPlanetary
   File system (IPFS). The IPFS-powered experiments confirmed the
   practicability of the proposed transaction spreading mechanism.},

Abstract = {We discuss research issues pertinent to providing reliable server
   pooling in military mobile ad-hoc networks. To persistently maintain
   connections for military applications even as links and nodes migrate or
   become disabled, server pooling is used to increase system availability
   by allowing a pool of redundant information sources to be viewed as a
   single transport endpoint. We aim to design reliable server pooling for
   networks that are highly mobile, have limited processing power, and are
   capable of rapid self-configuration and autoaddressing of nodes and
   interfaces. Novel aspects of our research are also the investigation of
   server pooling with respect to both end-user applications and
   infrastructure components, extensible, intelligent server selection
   policies to select pool elements more proactively, as well as an
   application's and the security middleware's state transfer. We define
   the following key architectural requirements for reliable server pooling
   in mobile ad-hoc networks: (1) fast switchover, (2) dynamic
   (re-)configuration, (3) survivability, (4) application transparency, and
   (5) control signal efficiency. The paper describes in detail how the
   above requirements are being addressed in our research, and presents the
   initial approaches to solutions.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, Android is one of the most popular operating systems for
   mobile devices. Therefore, an increasing number of exploits and
   malicious applications for Android are developed by attackers. Many
   Android applications have malicious or abnormal behaviour: stealing
   private information, subscribing to unwanted paid services, consuming a
   large amount of resources on the device and displaying unwanted
   advertisements. Students learning security need to understand the
   behaviour of such applications. In this paper, we propose an
   infrastructure for collecting information pertaining to application
   behaviour at runtime and exposing the malicious and atypical actions
   performed by Android applications. The purpose of this infrastructure is
   to provide a meaningful learning experience to students, as they study
   malicious applications. The infrastructure includes collectors at every
   level of the operating system and the behaviour information includes:
   the consumed resources (CPU, memory), the exchanged messages (SMSs,
   phone calls, packets), the state changes of the communication channels
   (WiFi, 3G, Bluetooth, NFC). Behaviour information is sent periodically
   from the collectors to a native application and can be visualised
   through a Graphical User Interface, directly on the mobile device.
   Students are allowed to select any process in the system and investigate
   its behaviour in real time. They also can extract the behaviour
   information from the mobile device in order to perform statistical
   analysis on the data. Students are able compare the collected data for
   legitimate and malicious/abnormal applications and identify the
   malicious behaviour patterns. These patterns can be used to discover new
   malware, that is not yet detected by commercial antivirus solutions. The
   learning experience provided by our infrastructure is essential for
   developing practical security skills.},

Abstract = {Objective: The purpose Of the present study was to examine the
   relationship between household food insecurity and maternal depression
   in a rural sample to determine whether food insecurity predicted
   mothers' depression over time or vice versa.
   Design: The study employed a prospective design using three waves of
   data from `Rural Families Speak', a multi-state study of low-income
   rural families in the USA. Food insecurity was measured using the Core
   Food Security Module and depression was measured using the Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. A structural equation model was
   fit to the data using the AMOS software package.
   Setting: Sixteen states in the USA (California, Indiana, Kentucky,
   Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New
   Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wyoming)
   between 2000 and 2002.
   Subjects: Subjects included 413 women with at least one child under the
   age of 13 years living in the home.
   Results: Findings based on the 184 subjects with complete data indicated
   that the causal relationship between household food insecurity and
   depression is bidirectional (P=0.034 for causation from depression to
   food insecurity, P=0.003 for causation from food insecurity to
   depression,) chi(2)/df = 1.835, root-mean-square error of approximation
   = 0.068, comaparative fit index = 0.989). Findings based on all 413
   subjects; after imputation of missing Values also indicated
   bidirectionality.
   Conclusions: The recursive relationship between food insecurity and
   depression has implications for US nutrition, Mental health and poverty
   policies. The study highlights the need to integrate programmes
   addressing food insecurity and poor mental health for the population of
   rural, low-income women.},

Abstract = {In the course of urbanization, the threat from climate change and energy
   security has stifled urban development severely. The construction of
   low-carbon city is an important carrier of energy-saving and
   emission-reduction and the development of low-carbon economy. It not
   only provides the bottleneck of urban development with solutions and
   affords a new opportunity, but also has great significance for
   addressing climate change and making urban development sustainable. From
   the point of theory combined with practice, this article carries out a
   research on the functions in the construction of low-carbon city. Not
   only is this research an impulse for the research on the shift in the
   government functions and the innovation of ways of government
   administration, it is also a breakthrough of the promotion of the
   governance, which has the profound practical and theoretical
   significance. Starting with the conception of the new construction
   system of low-carbon city, the article analyses the background,
   connotation, elements and operating mode of the construction of
   low-carbon city. Based on it, this article also researches into the
   current situation of the construction of low-carbon city and puts
   forward the government functions, building on ideas and successful
   experiences from abroad. The government in the construction of
   low-carbon is the rule-makers, guide of building orientation, supplier
   for service operation as well as the coordinator and supervisor of
   building operations. In this way, a new idea to develop the low-carbon
   city can be put forward in the course of China's urbanization.},

Title = {Crowd macro state detection using entropy model},
Journal = {PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {431},
Pages = {84-93},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {In the crowd security research area a primary concern is to identify the
   macro state of crowd behaviors to prevent disasters and to supervise the
   crowd behaviors. The entropy is used to describe the macro state of a
   self-organization system in physics. The entropy change indicates the
   system macro state change. This paper provides a method to construct
   crowd behavior microstates and the corresponded probability distribution
   using the individuals' velocity information (magnitude and direction).
   Then an entropy model was built up to describe the crowd behavior macro
   state. Simulation experiments and video detection experiments were
   conducted. It was verified that in the disordered state, the crowd
   behavior entropy is close to the theoretical maximum entropy; while in
   ordered state, the entropy is much lower than half of the theoretical
   maximum entropy. The crowd behavior macro state sudden change leads to
   the entropy change. The proposed entropy model is more applicable than
   the order parameter model in crowd behavior detection. By recognizing
   the entropy mutation, it is possible to detect the crowd behavior macro
   state automatically by utilizing cameras. Results will provide data
   support on crowd emergency prevention and on emergency manual
   intervention. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Croppers to livestock keepers: livelihood transitions to 2050 in Africa
   due to climate change},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {427-437},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The impacts of climate change are expected to be generally detrimental
   for agriculture in many parts of Africa. Overall, warming and drying may
   reduce crop yields by 10-20\% to 2050, but there are places where losses
   are likely to be much more severe. Increasing frequencies of heat
   stress, drought and flooding events will result in yet further
   deleterious effects on crop and livestock productivity. There will be
   places in the coming decades where the livelihood strategies of rural
   people may need to change, to preserve food security and provide
   income-generating options. These are likely to include areas of Africa
   that are already marginal for crop production; as these become
   increasingly marginal, then livestock may provide an alternative to
   cropping. We carried out some analysis to identify areas in sub-Saharan
   Africa where such transitions might occur. For the currently cropped
   areas (which already include the highland areas where cropping intensity
   may increase in the future), we estimated probabilities of failed
   seasons for current: climate conditions, and compared these with
   estimates obtained for future climate conditions in 2050, using
   downscaled climate model output for a higher and a lower greenhouse-gas
   emission scenario. Transition zones can be identified where the
   increased probabilities of failed seasons may induce shifts from
   cropping to increased dependence on livestock. These zones are
   characterised in terms of existing agricultural system, current
   livestock densities, and levels of poverty. The analysis provides
   further evidence that climate change impacts in the marginal cropping
   lands may be severe, where poverty rates are already high. Results also
   suggest that those likely to be more affected are already more poor, on
   average. We discuss the implications of these results in a
   research-for-development targeting context that is likely to see the
   poor disproportionately and negatively affected by climate change. (C)

Abstract = {The world has changed dramatically since the Cold War when there were
   two super powers. Then, it was relatively simple to identify our
   intelligence collection targets. It was sometimes hard to collect the
   intelligence, but the targets were clear. Today we live in a world of
   asymmetries. The most serious asymmetric threat facing the United States
   today is terrorism; a threat characterized by collections of loosely
   organized people who operate in shadowy networks that are difficult to
   identify and define and whose goal is the destruction of our way of
   life. The intelligence collection targets are thousands of people whose
   identities and whereabouts we do not always know.
   If we are to preserve our national security, we must figure out a way of
   combating this threat. The solution is largely associated with
   information technology. We must become much more efficient and clever in
   the ways we use existing sources of data to find new sources of data,
   mine it for new information, generate context relevant information, make
   it widely available for collaborative analysis, convert it to knowledge
   and create actionable options for senior decision-makers. Also. we need
   a more systemic approach to the problem. A variety of tools, processes
   and procedures will be required to deal with this problem, however, to
   be effective, they must be integrated and harmonized within a system
   context built around a common architecture.
   In this paper, we will provide a broad overview of the Total Information
   Awareness (TIA) program - a new counter terrorism initiative sponsored
   by the Information Awareness Office (IAO) at the Defense Advanced
   Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The TIA program will develop and
   integrate a variety of information technologies enabling early warning
   and understanding of terrorist activities and ultimately the preemption
   of terrorist attacks through collaborative decision making at the
   national security level. Examples of some of the key technologies needed
   for TIA include: entity and event detection and extraction, link
   discovery and pattern learning across space and time, human language
   exploitation including summarization and translation, biometrics and
   multi-modal techniques for human identification, various methods for
   privacy protection and policy formulation, and several prediction and
   estimation approaches to understand individual and group behavior and
   intent. TIA will also require concepts and methods for bringing users
   with diverse points of view together in a collaborative problem-solving
   environment, where they can have access to their relevant data sources,
   the use of discovery tools and the ability to exploit and quickly
   generate models for structured arguments that facilitate the
   presentation and vetting of competing hypotheses.},

Title = {Evaluating REST architectures-Approach, tooling and guidelines},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {112},
Pages = {156-180},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Architectural decisions determine the ability of the implemented system
   to satisfy functional and quality attribute requirements. The
   Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style has been
   extensively used recently for integrating services and applications. Its
   adoption to build SOA-based distributed systems brings several benefits,
   but also poses new challenges and risks. Particularly important among
   those risks are failures to effectively address quality attribute
   requirements such as security, reliability, and performance. A proved
   efficient technique to identify and help mitigate those risks is the
   architecture evaluation. In this paper we propose an approach, tooling,
   and guidelines to aid architecture evaluation activities in REST-based
   systems. These guidelines can be systematically used along with
   evaluation methods to reason about design considerations and tradeoffs.
   To demonstrate how the guidelines can help architecture evaluators, we
   present a proof of concept describing how to use the guidelines in an
   ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method) evaluation. We also present
   the results of a survey conducted with industry specialists who have
   performed architecture evaluations in real world REST-based systems in
   order to gauge the suitability and utility of the proposed guidelines.
   Finally, the paper describes a Web tool developed to facilitate the use
   of the evaluation guidelines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a practical method for
   computing contingency-based reliability and quality indices in power
   systems and to answer questions related to how much the system is
   reliable, how robust it is in surviving random contingencies, how much
   it is costing to maintain appropriate system security and reliability
   levels and, finally, to what extent the desired balance is maintained
   between generation facilities, transmission capabilities and consumer
   demand levels in various zones of the electric power system.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methodology adopted in this paper is
   based on a combined contingency analysis/reliability evaluation scheme.
   A three-component system model is utilized, which can be used
   effectively for evaluation and sensitivity analysis of reliability and
   quality in power systems. The model is a reduced (equivalent) system
   representation that comprises generation, transmission and load
   components with multi-state values. The computational scheme presented
   in the paper integrates both the contingency effect and its probability
   of occurrence into one routine of analysis while reducing the power
   system around the region of interest.
   Findings - The computational scheme presented in the paper can
   effectively assess both service reliability and system quality. The
   practical applications presented demonstrated that lower service
   reliability levels would jeopardize energy supply continuity and
   increase the likelihood of additional maintenance and restoration costs
   due to the resulting higher rate of system outages. Poor system quality
   levels, on the other hand, imply either deficiency or excess in the
   overall system capabilities as designed by its planners.
   Originality/value - The work of this paper contributes to the solution
   of the reliability and quality assessment problem in practical power
   systems. As part of the present work, an advanced computerized scheme
   for fast composite system reliability and quality assessment was
   developed and then applied to an equivalent system model of the Saudi
   electricity system. The results obtained are claimed to have
   far-reaching implications on various planning and operation aspects of
   the power system.},

Abstract = {Blockchain technology supports data immutability. Whereas, smart
   contracts are piece of self-executable codes running inside the
   blockchain network, responsible for the transformation or state change
   of these data. Furthermore, Cloud Computing is used in the application
   of data storage and usage. Several business enterprises use cloud for
   hosting their applications and data with a minimized effort, cost and
   hurdles of maintenance. However, ensuring security of client data and
   proper management of the Service Provider's infrastructure remains a
   crucial issue. In this article, an Ethereum based blockchain network has
   been proposed that monitors and assures the safety of the VirtualMachine
   Images (VMI) stored at the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) end. The
   proposed scheme tends to design a dedicated Smart Contract which handles
   each and every function, starting from request of a VMI by the Cloud
   Service Consumer (CSC) to the usage of the same by the later. The use of
   blockchain technology ensures that no single admin/third party can
   control/modify the system. This prevents unwanted modification of the
   VMIs by an intruder and guarantees the efficiency of the scheme to be
   higher than any other methodology designed for the same purpose till

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of hidden faults, which is seen like a
   growth one inherent in modern safety-related systems. The special
   feature of these is the designing for operation in two modes: normal and
   emergency. Digital components can accumulate hidden failures over a
   long-term normal mode. This reduces their fault tolerance and functional
   safety of the system in the most responsible emergency mode. Two
   conditions for occurrence of the hidden fault problem as a growth one
   are considered in view of a resource approach, which in the development
   of models, methods and means highlights levels of replication and
   diversification. Safety-related systems are analyzed as computer systems
   that have increased to the level of diversification to address the
   security challenge. Their components are still stamped at a level of
   resource replication using matrix structures to process data in parallel
   codes. Fault-tolerant solutions become fault-safe with a sufficient
   level of circuit checkability, which is commonly known as testability,
   i.e. structural checkability, depending only on the structure of the
   circuit. In the operating mode, the checkability becomes
   structurally-functional, and in critical applications it is converted
   into a dual-mode, the shortage of which causes the hidden fault problem.
   A method of analyzing circuits for the possibility of hidden faults is
   suggested. The method is illustrated on example of an iterative array
   multiplier implemented in an FPGA project with a LUT-oriented
   architecture. A program model for the resulting scheme has been
   developed and potentially dangerous points have been found in it in
   which the hidden fault problem of may manifest itself.},

Abstract = {Optical fiber channels are used as media to transfer the information
   globally. This paper presents an implementation of a novel procedure
   using which a secured communication between two parties can be carried
   out using polarized beam of light over an optical fiber. The paper
   presents the experimental results obtained of the procedure in the lab
   environment and a security analysis of the same. It is observed that
   polarization state of a light pulse cannot be retained as it travels
   over an optical fiber because of the birefringence phenomenon. Multiple
   environmental factors such as pressure, vibration, temperature, etc.
   also add a non-linearity to the birefringence of an optical fiber
   leading towards an unpredictable polarization state changes over the
   course of an optical fiber. The proposed procedure helps the receiving
   party to successfully retrieve the data in the form of a polarization
   state transmitted by the sending party without having any knowledge
   about the state of polarization at the transmitting end. The paper also
   explains an added layer of security the procedure provides to the
   communicating parties to make it difficult for an adversary to fetch the
   data being transferred. The proposed system does not depend on the
   wavelength of the light being used, nor does it depend upon the type of
   the optical fiber used for the communication. Using this procedure,
   multiple bits of secured information can be sent over an optical fiber
   in a single polarized pulse and retrieved at the receiving end, also
   known as Polarization Shift Keying.},

Abstract = {The security of smartphone GUI frameworks remains an important yet
   under-scrutinized topic. In this paper, we report that on the Android
   system (and likely other OSes), a weaker form of GUI confidentiality can
   be breached in the form of UI state (not the pixels) by a background app
   without requiring any permissions. Our finding leads to a class of
   attacks which we nameUI state inference attack. The underlying problem
   is that popular GUI frameworks by design can potentially reveal every UI
   state change through a newly-discovered public side channel - shared
   memory. In our evaluation, we show that for 6 out of 7 popular Android
   apps, the UI state inference accuracies are 80-90\% for the first
   candidate UI states, and over 93\% for the top 3 candidates.
   Even though the UI state does not reveal the exact pixels, we show that
   it can serve as a powerful building block to enable more serious
   attacks. To demonstrate this, we design and fully implement several new
   attacks based on the UI state inference attack, including hijacking the
   UI state to steal sensitive user input (e.g., login credentials) and
   obtain sensitive camera images shot by the user (e.g., personal check
   photos for banking apps). We also discuss non-trivial challenges in
   eliminating the identified side channel, and suggest more secure
   alternative system designs.},

Abstract = {Due to increasing incidents of security breaches in the cyber space, a
   rigorous user authentication process has become crucial. A very feasible
   biometric approach to verify the authenticity of a user is to examine
   his/her typing patterns. There is a significant difference in the
   keystroke patterns exhibited from person to person, even when asked to
   type the same words. Typing patterns can be shown in the intervals
   between keys, holding time, overlap keys, etc. Individual's typing
   pattern develops naturally and uniquely just as each person writes
   differently.
   We propose an analytical process based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) to
   learn the special patterns from individuals, and then to identify them.
   During training, the timing information of each keystroke is recorded at
   its holding and releasing events, and the pattern is then extracted from
   the relationship of the events within a word. The experiment to be
   conducted is to authenticate users when entering words. The idea is to
   implement a process to examine the typing pattern as a user enters
   higher password, in order to augment the conventional password system.
   We find the discrete first-order HMM to be very suitable for our
   purpose. Due to the non-deterministic nature of the keystroke events,
   modeling with a stochastic process such as the HMM which has
   probabilistic state transitions can not only recognize the patterns in
   the keys already typed, but also predict the following sequence. The
   issue is similar to the recognition of hand-written characters or spoken
   words. The experimental results are nearly perfect among twenty test
   subjects all randomly chosen in a controlled environment of a standard
   computer laboratory.},

Abstract = {In order to improve the comprehensive performance of energy dispatching
   between different sites, the optimization research of particle swarm
   optimization (PSO) algorithm and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm
   is carried out. We proposed a new improved PSO-ACO algorithm based on
   the idea of hybrid algorithm to solve the problem of poor energy
   dispatching efficiency between sites. First, the multiobjective
   performance indicators were introduced to transform the sites' energy
   dispatching problem into a multiobjective optimization problem. Second,
   the vitality factor was introduced into the PSO strategy to solve the
   local optimal problem, and in the PSO-ACO fusion strategy, the PSO
   routes were transformed into the ant colony enhancement pheromone to
   accelerate the accumulation speed of the ACO initial pheromone. Then,
   the angle guidance function was introduced into the state transition
   probability of the ACO strategy to improve the global search capability,
   and a high-quality pheromone update rule was proposed to improve the
   convergence speed of the algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments were
   carried out on the improved PSO-ACO algorithm, Min-Max Ant System (MMAS)
   algorithm, ACO algorithm, PSO algorithm, and PSO update algorithm in a
   variety of complex site scenarios. The simulation results show that the
   improved PSO-ACO algorithm can plan a site energy dispatching route with
   shorter route, less time-consuming, and higher security and realize the
   comprehensive and global optimization of energy dispatching.},

Abstract = {As the next-generation power grids, smart grids are integrated with
   advanced information and communication technology (ICT) to make the grid
   more efficient and stable than conventional power systems. Given the
   mounting cyber-attack threats, these critical ICT systems create great
   security issues for smart grids. Additionally, the clever attackers have
   the ability to not only access and monitor the smart grid, but also hack
   it by launching well-established cyber-attacks. Thus, this article is
   devoted to understanding the potential stealthy cyber-attack and its
   countermeasure. First, this article proposes a stealthy sparse
   cyber-attack model in an ac smart grid by considering both the residual
   test-based detector and the interval-state-estimation-based detector,
   which is not considered in previous studies. The design model is
   formulated as a constrained optimization problem by minimizing the
   number of contaminated meters, where the characteristics of two types of
   detector are considered simultaneously as the constraints for the first
   time. A constrained differential evolution (CDE) is proposed as the
   solver because the optimization problem is NP-hard. Then, a
   generalized-cumulative-sum-based detector is developed to detect the
   proposed cyber-attacks, where a fractional-order state transition matrix
   is originally introduced into the estimator to describe the dynamics of
   the power system. Numerical studies illustrate the feasibility of
   CDE-based stealthy sparse cyber-attacks and the effectiveness of the
   proposed countermeasure.},

Abstract = {Airport operation gets more complicated due to the increasing
   interconnectivity of the infrastructure and the dependency on advances
   in information and communication systems. There exist a manifold of
   different reasons for system failures of devices starting from
   short-circuits, hardware defects or malware infections reaching to power
   shortages or complete blackouts. Moreover, the increase of the number of
   devices within the airport infrastructure system leads to a tremendous
   demand of computational assistance systems for operations management. As
   most devices within the airport are directly connected to processes,
   there is a high demand for identifying and managing system failures
   immediately and increase the system resilience. Thus, we introduce
   process-oriented-grouping of network devices and use linear algebra to
   relate the impact of system state changes to airport processes, such as
   check-in, security checks et cetera. This connection between system
   state and processes is inevitable for a successful combination of
   computational approaches to determine physical state variations, induced
   by power grid instabilities and/or cyber-attacks, and process oriented
   simulation methods. Matrix relations between system states, process
   capacities, waiting times are given and applied to a small, at this
   state fictional airport infrastructure. This application shows that
   forecasting of quantitative values for airport processes is a beneficial
   tool for airport infrastructure management. Moreover, linear algebra
   properties prove to be a strong tool in analyzing network properties,
   such as infrastructure diversity and process capacities, which play a
   major role within resource management. However, at the moment our
   approach is only suitable as a supporting tool for human decision
   making. Nevertheless the approach can be enhanced as intelligent health
   monitoring system for airports.},

Abstract = {Reactor Pressure Vessel (hereinafter RPV) is the core component of PWR
   nuclear power plants. The nuclear power plants operation experience
   shows that the dangerous defects could produce in the material of Bottom
   Mounted Instrument and J type weld(hereinafter BMI). In early nuclear
   power plants, the BMI is made of corrosion-sensitive materials (such as
   Alloy 600). The stress corrosion crack is easy to grow up and destroy
   the integrity of RPV in operation. Therefore, inspection for BMI during
   the service stage is necessary to ensure the integrity of the primary
   circuit pressure boundary.
   The BMI is general made of Alloy 600 or Alloy 690 and penetrate the
   reactor pressure vessel lower head vertically to form J type weld on the
   inner wall of the RPV lower head. The inner diameter is generally 15 to
   16 mm and the wall thickness is about 15 mm. In order to improve the
   welding performance, the dissimilar metal J-type weld groove is usually
   overlaid with nickel-based pre-heap edge. The component structural and
   material characteristics have brought great difficulties to the test
   technology research as well as the location.
   In this paper, the main failure modes of BMI are introduced and the
   technical requirements of in-service inspections are presented. The
   technical scheme and inspection system are designed according to the
   above requirements and weld structural characteristics. Both UT and ET
   methods are used for the inspection. UT is based on the time of flight
   diffraction (hereinafter TOFD) technique. According to the structural
   and material characteristics of the BMI, many researches have been done
   on block with simulated defect, and characteristic rule of defect
   indication signals in different areas are summarized. Then, the optimal
   design parameters of the TOFD probe are gained and the disadvantages of
   ultrasonic inspection are overcome. The eddy current inspection system
   adopts the inspection technology with the Bobbin probe and the rotary
   point probe combined together. The use of its surface and near the
   surface of the detection ability has become a powerful complement to
   ultrasonic testing. From the test result, TOFD probe has high defect
   height measurement accuracy. Measurement error isn't more than 1mm and
   mostly is positive deviation. The surface defects with a height of not
   less than 2 mm can be measured.
   Considering the complex geometry of BMI, the multi mode multi-axis
   scanning program and remote automatic docking device are used in the
   system. The multi-mode multi axis scanning program can be achieved axial
   and circumferential rotation of the probe with the axial positioning
   accuracy within 2mm and circumferential positioning accuracy within 3
   degrees. The remote automatic docking device can be used to connect the
   bottom of the mechanical device and the top of the BMI in fast and
   seamless security to avoid the mechanical device bumping of the
   component. The probe connecting shaft is made of flexible material,
   which avoids the violent bumping of the tested parts and greatly
   enhances the safety of the equipment operation. The system simulates the
   actual scanning environment by establishing three-dimensional model and
   testing it on the simulation body.},

Abstract = {Reliable and timely information on agricultural production is essential
   for ensuring world food security. Freely available medium-resolution
   satellite data (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel) offer the possibility of
   improved global agriculture monitoring. Here we develop and test a
   method for estimating in-season crop acreage using a probability sample
   of field visits and producing wall-to-wall crop type maps at national
   scales. The method is illustrated for soybean cultivated area in the US
   for 2015. A stratified, two-stage cluster sampling design was used to
   collect field data to estimate national soybean area. The field-based
   estimate employed historical soybean extent maps from the U.S.
   Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer to delineate and
   stratify U.S. soybean growing regions. The estimated 2015 U.S. soybean
   cultivated area based on the field sample was 341,000 km(2) with a
   standard error of 23,000 km2. This result is 1.0\% lower than USDA's
   2015 June survey estimate and 1.9\% higher than USDA's 2016 January
   estimate. Our area estimate was derived in early September, about 2
   months ahead of harvest. To map soybean cover, the Landsat image archive
   for the year 2015 growing season was processed using an active learning
   approach. Overall accuracy of the soybean map was 84\%. The field-based
   sample estimated area was then used to calibrate the map such that the
   soybean acreage of the map derived through pixel counting matched the
   sample -based area estimate. The strength of the sample -based area
   estimation lies in the stratified design that takes advantage of the
   spatially explicit cropland layers to construct the strata. The success
   of the mapping was built upon an automated system which transforms
   Landsat images into standardized time-series metrics. The developed
   method produces reliable and timely information on soybean area in a
   cost-effective way and could be applied to other regions and potentially
   other crops in an operational mode. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {Security of a data framework is its significant property, particularly
   today, when PCs are interconnected by means of web. Since no framework
   can be completely secure, the opportune and precise recognition of
   interruptions is essential. For this reason, intrusion detection systems
   (IDS) were planned. An interruption identification framework's principle
   aspiration is to sort exercises of a framework into two key classes:
   standard and suspicious exercises. Most IDS business devices are abuse
   frameworkswith principle-based master framework structure. Be that as it
   may, these strategies are less effective when assault qualities shift
   from inherent marks. In such manner, a scope of pre-preparing practices,
   for example, information mining, neural systems, Petri nets, state
   change outlines, hereditary calculations, choice trees and fluffy-based
   rationales is worked out. In this paper, we have considered distinctive
   fluffy methodologies for interruption identification framework utilizing
   fuzzy set hypothesis, and we dissect fuzzy standard, expressly for
   peculiarity-based assault finding. For structure inconsistency
   framework, neural systems likewise can be utilized, on the grounds that
   they can figure out how to segregate the ordinary and anomalous conduct
   of a framework from models. Along these lines, they offer a promising
   strategy for structure oddity frameworks. Fake neural systems give the
   possibility to recognize and arrange organized action dependent on
   constrained, fragmented and nonlinear information sources. We have
   completed a similar report between two delicate registering procedures
   utilization of fluffy in the event that principles versus use of the
   feed forward neural network prepared by back-propagation calculation for
   interruption location. Reenactment result demonstrates that the feed
   forward neural network prepared by back-propagation calculation for
   interruption location yields better outcome which distinguishes the
   interruptions precisely and is well reasonable for constant applications

Abstract = {Aerial radiological search and survey missions have been performed by
   the United States Department of Energy's (USDOE) Remote Sensing
   Laboratory for over 40 years. Originally created in 1967 as Aerial
   Measurement Operations, the Aerial Measuring System ( AMS) mission has
   expanded to include acquiring baseline measurements, performing periodic
   site monitoring, and responding to radiological emergencies. In an
   accident scenario, AMS fixedwing and/or rotary-wing systems can be
   deployed to map radiological deposition. The aircraft are equipped to
   detect and measure radioactive contamination on the ground. The AMS has
   a sophisticated radiation detection system to gather radiological
   information and store it on the cloud using the Advanced Visualization
   and Integration of Data (AVID) platform or on local computers. This
   large amount of radiation monitoring data is later used to define and
   implement public protective guidance.
   Aerial radiation measurements have proven to be very effective in
   support of responses to nuclear or radiological emergencies resulting in
   the dispersal of radioactive material over a large area {[}viz.
   Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear power plant measurements done through March
   and April 2011] {[}1]. Right after the Fukushima accident, US aerial
   missions flew 85 flights over 500 hours, covering more than 10,000
   square kilometres from the power plant to an 80 km radius to create a
   common operating picture of the extent of the gamma-emitting
   radionuclides and the footprint of the deposition from multiple
   releases.
   In order to be effective, the aerial measurements must be performed with
   a system that will collect the data in sufficient detail and quality to
   support the needs of emergency responders. This paper briefly outlines
   the technical specifications and functions of a system to be used on an
   aerial platform (airplane or helicopter) to measure widespread
   radioactive material (radioactive contamination). The information
   contained within this paper is intended to help ensure that measurements
   conducted by multiple AMSs are both technically compatible and
   comparable with each other and with measurements taken on the ground.
   Recently AMS has acquired newer and faster aircraft with
   longer-than-before ranges to deploy radiation monitoring equipment. This
   article defines and provides guidance for using the US DOE/NNSA's new
   aerial measurement platforms with multi-fold return of the investment in
   mind. The guidance involves technical innovation and optimized use of
   the platforms and collaboration with other stakeholders like the
   Department of Homeland Security, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and
   the Environmental Protection Agency. The guidance recommends AMS to
   reposition itself as a valid and credentialed data provider to other
   relevant and recognized stakeholders in the area of chemical,
   biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives threats. It recommends
   critical application expansion for AVID to analyse multi-modal data
   including hyperspectral, infrared, and radiological data through data
   fusion.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to identify a set of crucial indicators to
   assess the most pressing environmental impacts of diets.
   Based on a literature review, 55 potential assessment methods were
   selected and their distinctive indicators identified. The methods were
   classified according to their position in the DPSIR framework {[}chain
   of Drivers, Pressures, State (changes), Impacts, and Responses], and
   into 15 environmental issues at three levels. The selection was narrowed
   down to eight, based on the availability of reliable methods, their
   relevance to agri-food systems, their frequent application for diets,
   and their recommendation by international bodies.
   (1) At the global (supra) level, the planetary boundaries approach
   addresses the current global environmental (change in) state and helps
   to prioritize the most pressing issues related to the agri-food system
   as a driver. These issues are climate change, nitrogen and phosphorus
   cycle disruption, land-use change, and freshwater use. (2) At the
   national (macro) level, the footprints approach is used to identify
   indicators. This footprint family includes ecological, land, carbon,
   energy, and water footprints. International bodies support these key
   indicators, but they recommend complementary assessment methods for
   nitrogen and phosphorus flows, soil health, and pesticide use. (3) At
   the product (micro) level, life cycle assessment includes 11 pressure
   indicators. Of the latter, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) and land use
   (LU) are the most frequently used indicators in diet studies.
   We conclude that GHGEs and LU fulfill the selection criteria and address
   most of the environmental impact of diets well. In the future, these
   indicators should be supplemented with an indicator addressing the
   nitrogen and phosphorous efficiency of food products.},

Abstract = {The first IFIP/IEEE international workshop on Managing Federations and
   Cooperative Management (ManFed.CoM) took place in conjunction with the
   IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management (IM
   2011) conference in Trinity College Dublin, Ireland on May 23rd 2011.
   The multi-mode, loosely coupled, user-centric nature of modern
   communications and services, coupled with the diversity of operator
   business models, ensure that modern end-to-end service provision
   frequently crosses heterogeneous management and administrative domains.
   Thus, management approaches that can be applied across organizational
   boundaries are increasingly important in a wide range of application
   areas. There are a number of significant, common, complex issues which
   must be addressed in all technologies and applications that involve
   federated organizations, yet research has heretofore been mostly
   confined to particular technical or application areas. The first
   installment of ManFed.Com addressed this gap by bringing together
   researchers from a broad array of application and technical areas who
   shared an interest in cross-domain management. The workshop drew out
   common themes, problems and issues encountered, and the solutions being
   designed to deal with the problems of managing information systems that
   span autonomous domains. More than 30 researchers participated in a
   lively and interactive day of paper presentation, panels and software
   demonstrations. The success of the inaugural event was such that the
   organizing committee is now committed to running further
   installations-we are in the process of preparing a submission to run a
   the 2nd ManFed.CoM in conjunction with the IEEE/IFIP Network Operations
   and Management Symposium (NOMS) 2012 conference. We believe that these
   workshops will help to provide the basis for a common understanding and
   common approaches to inter-domain management and governance that
   synthesizes the insights and best-of-breed solutions being developed in
   the diverse areas in which these problems are encountered. The technical
   program of ManFed.CoM 2011 was organized as a single track and was
   composed of two panels of invited experts, two full paper sessions, one
   short paper session and a demonstration session in which practical
   software tools were presented. Of the 16 papers submitted, 6 were
   selected for presentation as full papers, with a further 3 being
   presented in condensed form as short papers. All the papers submitted
   underwent a rigorous review process, receiving between 2 and 5 reviews
   each, with the accepted full papers receiving a minimum score of 7.5 out
   of 10 from reviewers. The papers presented constituted a good
   cross-section of current cross-domain management research work-they
   covered modeling, semantic interoperability, trust management and
   security, policy based management, business process orchestration,
   collaboration and delegation and look at management on a number of
   different layers-from low level network management, all the way up to
   high level business-driven management.},

Abstract = {Computer networks and surging advancements of innovative information
   technology construct a critical infrastructure for network transactions
   of business entities. Information exchange and data access though such
   infrastructure is scrutinized by adversaries for vulnerabilities that
   lead to cyber-attacks. This paper presents an agent-based system
   modelling to conceptualize and extract explicit and latent structure of
   the complex enterprise systems as well as human interactions within the
   system to determine common vulnerabilities of the entity. The model
   captures emergent behavior resulting from interactions of multiple
   network agents including the number of workstations, regular,
   administrator and third-party users, external and internal attacks,
   defense mechanisms for the network setting, and many other parameters. A
   risk-based approach to modelling cybersecurity of a business entity is
   utilized to derive the rate of attacks. A neural network model will
   generalize the type of attack based on network traffic features allowing
   dynamic state changes. Rules of engagement to generate self-organizing
   behavior will be leveraged to appoint a defense mechanism suitable for
   the attack-state of the model. The effectiveness of the model will be
   depicted by time-state chart that shows the number of affected assets
   for the different types of attacks triggered by the entity risk and the
   time it takes to revert into normal state. The model will also associate
   a relevant cost per incident occurrence that derives the need for
   enhancement of security solutions.},

Abstract = {Recent architectural approaches that address speculative side-channel
   attacks aim to prevent software from exposing the microarchitectural
   state changes of transient execution. The Delay-on-Miss technique is one
   such approach, which simply delays loads that miss in the L1 cache until
   they become non-speculative, resulting in no transient changes in the
   memory hierarchy. However, this costs performance, prompting the use of
   value prediction (VP) to regain some of the delay.
   However, the problem cannot be solved by simply introducing a new kind
   of speculation (value prediction). Value-predicted loads have to be
   validated, which cannot be commenced until the load becomes
   nonspeculative. Thus, value-predicted loads occupy the same amount of
   precious core resources (e.g., reorder buffer entries) as Delay-on-Miss.
   The end result is that VP only yields marginal benefits over
   Delay-on-Miss.
   In this paper, our insight is that we can achieve the same goal as VP
   (increasing performance by providing the value of loads that miss)
   without incurring its negative side-effect (delaying the release of
   precious resources), if we can safely, non-speculatively, recompute a
   value in isolation (without being seen from the outside), so that we do
   not expose any information by transferring such a value via the memory
   hierarchy. Value Recomputation, which trades computation for data
   transfer was previously proposed in an entirely different context: to
   reduce energy-expensive data transfers in the memory hierarchy. In this
   paper, we demonstrate the potential of value recomputation in relation
   to the Delay-on-Miss approach of hiding speculation, discuss the
   trade-offs, and show that we can achieve the same level of security,
   reaching 93\% of the unsecured baseline performance (5\% higher than
   Delay-on-miss), and exceeding (by 3\%) what even an oracular (100\%
   accuracy and coverage) value predictor could do.},

Abstract = {In 2007 and 2008 ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana/Italian Space Agency)
   launched three out of four X-band SAR satellites of the COSMO-SkyMed
   (COnstellation of small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation)
   constellation, making available to the users a unique SAR constellation
   dedicated to the Earth Observation.
   The constellation will be completed with the launch of the fourth
   satellite in 2010.
   COSMO-SkyMed is the largest Italian investment in Space Systems for
   Earth Observation, commissioned and funded by Italian Space Agency (ASI)
   and Italian Ministry of Defense (MoD). COSMO-SkyMed is a Dual-Use
   (Civilian and Defence) end-to-end Earth Observation System aimed to
   establish a global service supplying provision of data, products and
   services relevant to a wide range of applications, such as Risk
   Management, Scientific and Commercial Applications and
   Defence/Intelligence Applications.
   The system consists of a constellation of four Low Earth Orbit mid-sized
   satellites, each equipped with a multi-mode high-resolution Synthetic
   Aperture Radar (SAR) operating at X-band. The system is completed by
   dedicated full featured Ground infrastructures for managing the
   constellation and granting ad-hoc services for collection, archiving and
   distribution of acquired remote sensing data.
   The first and second COSMO-SkyMed satellites are in the operational
   phase while the third one is completing its commissioning phase.
   The results coming from the utilisation of the two first satellites,
   after the first year of life, revealing an excellent performance of the
   X-band SAR and the importance of a fast response time in several
   application as risk and emergency management (i.e., China's earthquake,
   Myanmar and Haiti flood), ice monitoring (reduction of the glaciers,
   Wilkins Ice Shelf disintegration), multi-temporal acquisition for
   agriculture monitoring, ship detection, interferometry, landslides
   monitoring, maritime surveillance and security, rapid mapping.
   A further step forward will be realized when COSMO-SkyMed 3 will be
   operative, since the third satellite is positioned in the so-called
   ``one-day interferometry configuration{''}, it will allow the
   constellation to detect interferometric acquisitions with a
   de-correlation time equal to one day.
   The first COSMO-SkyMed Announcement of Opportunity for scientific data
   exploitation will give the chance to achieve innovative and valuable
   results using the COSMO-SkyMed data, products and services.},

Abstract = {In the digital world, secure data communication has an important role in
   mass media and Internet technology. With the increase in modern
   malicious technologies, confidential data are exposed at a greater risk
   during data communication. For secured communication, recent
   technologies and the Internet have introduced steganography, a new way
   to hide data. Steganography is the growing practice of concealing data
   in multimedia files for secure data transfer. Nowadays, videos are more
   commonly chosen as cover media than other multimedia files because of
   the moving sequence of images and audio files. Despite its popularity,
   video steganography faces a significant challenge, which is a lack of a
   fast retrieval system of the hidden data. This study proposes a novel
   video steganography technique in which an enhanced hidden Markov model
   (EHMM) is employed to improve the speed of retrieving hidden data. EHMM
   mathematical formulations are used to enhance the speed of embedding and
   extracting secret data. The data embedding and retrieving operations
   were performed using the conditional states and the state transition
   dynamics between the video frames. The proposed EHMM is extensively
   evaluated using three benchmark functions, and experimental evaluations
   are conducted to test the speed of data retrieval using differently
   sized cover-videos. Results indicate that the proposed EHMM yields
   better results by reducing the data hiding time by 3-50\%, improving the
   data retrieval rate by 22-77\% with a minimum computational cost of
   20-91\%, and improving the security by 4-77\% compared with
   state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {During the last years, because of the evolution of Cloud applications
   and the attractive advantages given to consumers, many companies
   outsource their data and Information Technology (IT) system to the Cloud
   based technology. With the growth in the number of Cloud Service
   Providers, many enterprises and organizations can use and associate
   services from multiple providers. There may be many Internet protocols
   for service access standards that are used to ensure interoperability
   between users browser and Web server, such as Representational State
   Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Each service
   has its specific characteristics such as authentication and security
   requirements. Hence, Cloud providers attempt to lock customers into
   proprietary interfaces so consumers can find themselves at not expects
   inevitable vendor lock-in. Therefore, the focus of our paper is to
   propose a solution to this problem by using Cloud intermediate between
   Cloud providers and consumer in heterogeneous Cloud environments
   interfaces. This is to achieve benefits such as standardization and
   interoperability, minimizing lock-in of Cloud providers. To reach such
   benefits, we propose a Cloud SaaS based on two interfaces and an interne
   component. These interfaces are used in Cloud Consumer and Provider
   sides and therefore guarantee communication between Cloud Consumer and
   Provider using different Internet protocols for Web service access such
   as REST and SOAP. Our approach guarantees interoperability and
   standardization in heterogeneous Cloud based environments because in
   this case Cloud Consumer and Provider using REST interface can
   communicate easily with Cloud Provider and Consumer using SOAP
   interface.},

Abstract = {For a modern vehicle, if a sensor in the vehicle Anti-lock Braking
   System (ABS) or the controller area network (CAN) bus is attacked during
   a brake process, the vehicle will lose driving direction control and
   driver's life will be highly threatened. However, current methods for
   detecting attacks are not sufficiently accurate and no methods can
   provide attack mitigation. To ensure vehicle ABS security, we propose an
   attack detection method to accurately detect both sensor attack and CAN
   bus attack in a vehicle ABS, and an attack mitigation strategy to
   mitigate their negative effects on the vehicle ABS. In our attack
   detection method, we build a vehicle state space equation which
   considers-time road friction coefficient to predict vehicle states
   (i.e., wheel speed and longitudinal brake force) with their previous
   values. Based on sets of historical measured vehicle states, we develop
   a search algorithm to find out attack changes (vehicle state changes
   because of the attack) by minimizing errors between predicted vehicle
   states and measured vehicle states. In our attack mitigation strategy,
   attack changes are subtracted from measured vehicle states to generate
   correct vehicle states for the vehicle ABS. We conducted first real
   sensor attack experiments to show how a magnet affects sensor readings.
   Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack detection method
   can detect sensor attack and CAN bus attack more accurately compared
   with existing methods, and also our attack mitigation strategy ost
   eliminates attack's effects on the vehicle ABS.},

   this type of isolated operating mode, an accurate, fast, scalable,
   efficient power flow analysis tool is crucial. Conventional power flow
   analysis face challenges when applied to isolated microgrids such as
   singularity results from system radiality, high R/X ratio, relatively
   small rated distributed generation (DG) units and thus absence of
   conventional slack bus, extensive computational burden, convergence
   issues and extensive solution time. Although branch-based power flow
   techniques are more preferred for distribution systems to overcome some
   of the aforementioned challenges, these techniques are incompatible with
   isolated microgrids as they necessitate the availability of a slack bus.
   This paper presents a novel branch-based methodology based on the use of
   power sweeps to solve the steady-state power flow problem. The proposed
   forward-return-forward-backward sweep (FR-FBS) includes Consideration of
   inherent isolated microgrid characteristics, such as its variable
   frequency and the absence of a slack bus. The proposed approach also
   incorporates practical operating mddes for DG units and a variety of
   load characteristics. In addition, the inversion-fred nature and
   consequent speed of the algorithm avoid excessive computational time,
   thus making it suitable for large distribution networks. The proposed
   algorithm has been applied to test systems and the obtained results were
   compared to those obtained with time-domain simulations as well as
   newton trusted region load flow method. In addition, the effect of load
   changing on micrgrid's voltage profile and power sharing among different
   DGs were studied. The results show the accuracy and effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm. This tool therefore offers support for online energy
   management, self-healing applications, and emerging techniques for
   clustering power systems into adaptive self-adequate microgrids. (C)

Abstract = {The scope and applicability of detecting gamma-emitting materials by
   first responders and advanced searchers have changed considerably over
   the last 15 years. More often than not the searchers are being asked to
   obtain an image of the gamma sources that are shielded or otherwise
   inaccessible. They are constantly being tasked to localize a moving
   source in busy traffic. Commercially available gamma detection units and
   prototype Government-funded research products use complex techniques
   such as hybrid imaging processes (combination of traditional Compton
   imaging with coded aperture masks, for example, modified uniformly
   redundant array {[}MURA] patterns). Standalone radiation detection
   systems are increasingly capitalizing on multi-modal detection,
   emphasizing on data fusion, informatics, and novel signal/signature
   exploitations.
   At the request of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
   Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction (CWMD) Office, previously known
   as the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), a study committee from
   the American Physical Society has recommended that emphasis is kept on
   the ability to detect shielded special nuclear material with high
   sensitivity and reliability. Development of new and improved detection
   algorithms ( e.g., principal component analysis, maximum-likelihood
   estimation algorithm, and others) has been encouraged. CWMD has been
   urged to focus on signature identification in its nuclear forensic
   portfolio. Newer materials like SrI3:Eu2+, LaBr3:Ce, CeBr3:Ca2+ with
   fast rise time and short decay time of gamma pulses, high intrinsic
   gamma sensitivity, high gamma energy resolution, and high-efficiency
   conversion of excitation energy to fluorescent radiation are constantly
   being sought to build gamma detectors. Neutron detection and associated
   activation analysis using a gamma ray detection system is highly
   encouraged.
   There is a constant demand for miniaturization of gamma radiation
   detection system for tactical usage in the field- the most sought-after
   device must be lightweight, easy to use, should be able to withstand
   harsh environmental conditions, long shelf life with commensurate long
   battery life, high sensitivity (with preferably high resolution),
   capable of creating flexible and configurable alarm conditions with
   directional sensitivity. This array of technical constraints demands
   stringent specifications on the readout electronics, data acquisition
   technologies, interoperability and interconnectivity of data output and
   strict quality assurance of the detection and measurement devices.
   In recent years the CWMD has developed a system called Intelligent
   Radiation Sensing System (IRSS) that harnesses the information gathered
   by ubiquitous radiation monitoring systems deployed by the state, local,
   and tribal law enforcement organizers {[}1]. The IRSS was created to
   better equip law enforcement entities to protect large cities from the
   threats and harmful effects of nuclear or radiological incidents and
   emergencies. The IRSS uses a breakthrough technology that networks a
   group of portable radiation detectors with improved detection,
   localization, and identification of potential radiological threat. The
   program created a robust, flexible network architecture along with
   advanced data fusion algorithms that combine information from many
   detectors.
   A study {[}2] published in the Journal of Materials Research summarized
   the basic requirements for materials to be used in development of
   scalable radiation detection systems that considered the critical
   material performance metrics of energy resolution (1\% for
   semiconductors like CZT, <3\% for scintillators like LaBr3:Ce at 662 keV
   primary gamma ray energy from Cs-137 isotope), fast timing including
   high mobility of electrons and holes in the semiconductors and fast
   scintillation processes, high spatial resolution for imaging purposes,
   high intrinsic detection efficiency (requiring high density, high
   effective atomic number Z(eff)), high geometric efficiency achieved
   sometimes by occlusion processes, neutron detection efficiency and
   operational factors like cost, ease of use, use of peripheral equipment
   like thermomechanical engines to stabilize the detection systems.
   Exciting new research and development work utilizing effective data
   mining algorithms is being performed at universities, national
   laboratories, and commercial institutions in gamma ray detection
   technology. For example, gamma ray imaging techniques first used in
   space telescopes are being applied in modern security and health systems
   in a joint project between the University of Southampton and industrial
   partner Symetrica. The project aims to develop a new coded aperture
   imaging system that could inspire a new generation of ``stand-off{''}
   imaging systems. These systems would allow for remote inspection for
   radioactive materials.
   This review article intends to capture the synergy of international
   commercial collaborations exemplified by the United States Defense
   Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA's) SIGMA program in which
   detector expertise originating from the United Kingdom (Kromek Group
   plc.) algorithm development and system modelling and analysis developed
   by United States national laboratories came together under the general
   guidance provided by a small commercial unit, Invincea Labs, in the area
   of network algorithm integration and development.},

Title = {ACTION-EHR: Patient-Centric Blockchain-Based Electronic Health Record
   Data Management for Cancer Care},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {Background: With increased specialization of health care services and
   high levels of patient mobility, accessing health care services across
   multiple hospitals or clinics has become very common for diagnosis and
   treatment, particularly for patients with chronic diseases such as
   cancer. With informed knowledge of a patient's history, physicians can
   make prompt clinical decisions for smarter, safer, and more efficient
   care. However, due to the privacy and high sensitivity of electronic
   health records (EHR), most EHR data sharing still happens through fax or
   mail due to the lack of systematic infrastructure support for secure,
   trustable health data sharing, which can also cause major delays in
   patient care.
   Objective: Our goal was to develop a system that will facilitate secure,
   trustable management, sharing, and aggregation of EHR data. Our
   patient-centric system allows patients to manage their own health
   records across multiple hospitals. The system will ensure patient
   privacy protection and guarantee security with respect to the
   requirements for health care data management, including the access
   control policy specified by the patient.
   Methods: We propose a permissioned blockchain-based system for EHR data
   sharing and integration. Each hospital will provide a blockchain node
   integrated with its own EHR system to form the blockchain network. A
   web-based interface will be used for patients and doctors to initiate
   EHR sharing transactions. We take a hybrid data management approach,
   where only management metadata will be stored on the chain Actual EHR
   data, on the other hand, will be encrypted and stored off-chain in
   Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant
   cloud-based storage. The system uses public key infrastructure-based
   asymmetric encryption and digital signatures to secure shared EHR data.
   Results: In collaboration with Stony Brook University Hospital, we
   developed ACTION-EHR, a system for patient-centric, blockchain-based EHR
   data sharing and management for patient care, in particular radiation
   treatment for cancer. The prototype was built on Hyperledger Fabric, an
   open-source, permissioned blockchain framework. Data sharing
   transactions were implemented using chaincode and exposed as
   representational state transfer application programming interfaces used
   for the web portal for patients and users. The HL7 Fast Healthcare
   Interoperability Resources standard was adopted to represent shared EHR
   data, making it easy to interface with hospital EHR systems and
   integrate a patient's EHR data. We tested the system in a distributed
   environment at Stony Brook University using deidentified patient data.
   Conclusions: We studied and developed the critical technology components
   to enable patient-centric, blockchain-based EHR sharing to support
   cancer care. The prototype demonstrated the feasibility of our approach
   as well as some of the major challenges. The next step will be a pilot
   study with health care providers in both the United States and
   Switzerland. Our work provides an exemplar testbed to build
   next-generation EHR sharing infrastructures.},

Abstract = {The primary memory of the computer gets corrupted due to microparticles
   that possess a great deal of energy. This causes transient kind of
   errors and it is called subtle errors. High corruption of data in
   computer systems has been occurred because of these errors. Major
   sources of subtle errors include ionic particles, huge radiations say
   example alpha, beta and gamma rays, protons, neutrons etc., When TCAM
   configuration changes from 120 nm to 20 nm technology, there was a
   drastic increase in subtle errors more than multiples of eight. Devices
   operated in low power regions are more prone to subtle errors. Memory
   storage devices like secondary memory element called cache, registers
   are more feasible to subtle errors.(1) Behavior of subtle errors never
   damage circuit configuration but changes the information content leading
   to erroneous data. The proposed architecture is called N-SEARCH KEY
   TCAM, where in this system, it has been predicted that occurrence of
   subtle errors are very small. This innovative method of detecting and
   correcting both single and burst type of subtle errors has many modules
   like TCAM, Multiplexer, control circuit and Error correction code frame.
   Moreover, the proposed architecture N-SEARCH KEY ternary memory uses a
   special LUT for matching process. A key named Search key was generated
   which contains don't care bits for matching subtle errors. Unlike
   regular TCAM, this design uses sequential LUT which enhances matching
   time of order O(wnlog2n). Initially, proposed scheme have been used to
   find single bit subtle errors by changing forbearance factor (F) and
   chances of occurrence of error among TCAM information. The design was
   enhanced to detect multiple subtle errors and rectified the same. If
   match not occurs with predetermined information, then IP filter forbids
   the unauthorized users from using global network resources, thus
   providing better information security. By the proposed method, number of
   improper segregation ratio decreases with increase in Forbearance ratio
   parameter and time required to detect and correct the same is also
   considerably reduced. By controlling the forbearance factor F, the best
   duration schemes can be chosen. Through the given architecture, average
   time consumption for error checking of subtle errors would range from
   0.6 to 0.7 mu s.},

Title = {Quantification label for mobile apps},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},

Pages = {124-138},
Abstract = {Nowadays every product we purchase has a tag informing its users how
   much an automobile or an appliance will cost to run and how much energy
   a food product will provide on consumption, for example. With the advent
   of Internet, purchasing Apps becomes habitual, as Apps facilitate easy
   way of trading and generate money according to App online stores.
   Currently, Apps provide label that contains a combination of developer
   info, memory size, category, operating system compatibility, user
   ratings and reviews, and privacy policy. However, the product label
   information is asymmetrical and it varies with the developer. It is
   challenging to develop common standards explicit to users, as their
   needs are dynamic; moreover, the App undergoes a series of state changes
   during execution, according to the usage pattern. We propose a
   quantification label framework to assess the mobile/web App using a set
   of quantifiers, such as functionality, degree and domain of
   connectivity, battery consumption, and its vulnerability index for
   generating a set of standard labels. The corresponding labels in the
   label frame are: features, popularity, energy consumption and security.
   Further, we utilized principal component analysis (PCA), a statistical
   technique to assist the customers in selecting the prominent features
   from the dataset and to compare related apps, which analyzes the
   quantifiers in the given datasets and distinguish them according to the
   variances. The experimental results in quantifying a real time traffic
   data of an internet based App validated the proposed label by revealing
   the key features to the users; moreover, PCA carried out on four sets of
   traffic data enabled the selection of prominent data, and the results
   also revealed the possible embedding of the framework within an App for
   dynamic monitoring.},

Title = {Evaluating the impacts of new walking and cycling infrastructure on
   carbon dioxide emissions from motorized travel: A controlled
   longitudinal study},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {128},
Pages = {284-295},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Walking and cycling is widely assumed to substitute for at least some
   motorized travel and thereby reduce energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions. While the evidence suggests that a supportive built
   environment may be needed to promote walking and cycling, it is unclear
   whether and how interventions in the built environment that attract
   walkers and cyclists may reduce transport CO2 emissions. Our aim was
   therefore to evaluate the effects of providing new infrastructure for
   walking and cycling on CO2 emissions from motorized travel.
   A cohort of 1849 adults completed questionnaires at baseline (2010) and
   one-year follow-up (2011), before and after the construction of new
   high-quality routes provided as part of the Sustrans Connect2 programme
   in three UK municipalities. A second cohort of 1510 adults completed
   questionnaires at baseline and two-year follow-up (2012). The
   participants reported their past-week travel behaviour and car
   characteristics from which CO2 emissions by mode and purpose were
   derived using methods described previously. A set of exposure measures
   of proximity to and use of the new routes were derived.
   Overall transport CO2 emissions decreased slightly over the study
   period, consistent with a secular trend in the case study regions. As
   found previously the new infrastructure was well used at one- and
   two-year follow-up, and was associated with population-level increases
   in walking, cycling and physical activity at two-year follow-up.
   However, these effects did not translate into sizeable CO2 effects as
   neither living near the infrastructure nor using it predicted changes in
   CO2 emissions from motorized travel, either overall or disaggregated by
   journey purpose. This lack of a discernible effect on travel CO2
   emissions are consistent with an interpretation that some of those
   living nearer the infrastructure may simply have changed where they
   walked or cycled, while others may have walked or cycled more but few,
   if any, may have substituted active for motorized modes of travel as a
   result of the interventions. While the findings to date cannot exclude
   the possibility of small effects of the new routes on CO2 emissions, a
   more comprehensive approach of a higher `dosage' of active travel
   promotion linked with policies targeted at mode shift away from private
   motorized transport (such as urban car restraint and parking pricing,
   car sharing/pooling for travel to work, integrating bike sharing into
   public transport system) may be needed to achieve the substantial CO2
   savings needed to meet climate change mitigation and energy security
   goals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
