The biometric recognition systems provide suitable personal recognition approaches for determining individuals. Biometrics are broadly employed in several commercial as well as official identification systems for automatic access control. This paper introduces the model for multi-modal biometric recognition based on the feature level fusion method. The overall procedure of the proposed method involves four steps: pre-processing, feature extraction, recognition feature-level fusion, and Bio-metric recognition. The first step is to input the images into pre-processing steps. Thus, pre-processing three traits, like face, finger knuckle, and the hand vein, is done. Then, the feature extraction is done for each modality to extract the features. After that, the feature level fusion is carried out using Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) and the proposed Taylor-Grey Wolf optimization (Tay-GWO). After feature fusion, the Bio-metric recognition is done based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), which Tay-GWO trains. The proposed Tay-GWO is designed by integrating the Taylor series and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO). The analysis shows that the developed model achieves the maximal accuracy of 94.86%, maximal sensitivity of 96.80%, and specificity of 93.74%, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Multi-modal bio-metric system,Taylor series,Grey wolf optimization,Deep convolutional neural network,Cryptography,Computer Science,Multimedia Information Systems,Computer Communication Networks,Data Structures and Information Theory,Special Purpose and Application-Based Systems,,,1380-7501,1573-7721,81,30,Regular,,44021,44043,11042,2022-11-28,2022-12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By inserting bias into the power system meter measurements, FDIA can cause errors in state estimation and consequently mislead power system operation. Recently, the coordinated state-and-topology FDIA was developed to falsify both the meter measurements and the topology information to conceal a cyber or physical attack. Conventional machine-learning-based detection methods against FDIA depend on the complete observability of power system topology, therefore cannot detect the coordinated state-and-topology FDIA. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal learning model based on Graph Auto-Encoder (GAE) and Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) to detect this type of FDIA. First, GAE is used to learn the compact representation of power system topologies. Then, the obtained topological representation is fused with the measurement to obtain the multi-modal features. Third, ResNet is trained as a multi-label classifier to accept the fused features and generate an array, which can detect attack scenarios and identify the falsified measurements/topologies by coordinated attacks. Comprehensive case studies using IEEE 9-bus, IEEE 57-bus, and IEEE 118-bus systems are presented. The simulation results show that, as compared to single feature methods, the proposed method is more effective in detecting coordinated state-and-topology attacks, and more robust in case of FDIA under unseen topological changes in power system operation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Power system cyber security,False data injection attack,Topology attack,Multi-modal learning,Data-driven methods,Engineering,Electrical Engineering,"Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation","Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks",,,,1975-0102,2093-7423,17,5,Regular,,2649,2662,42835,2022-09-09,2022-09,,,,,,Original Article,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several conceptual models help with describing the attack process and associated entities, in developing a taxonomy of cyber threats. For Example, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) helps to describe a system to manage cyber security risk. In addition, the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) and the Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) are used to standardize indicator information into a form that will make the data sharable. This helps to structure the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) information in order to use it in defensive approaches (e.g., DREAD: damage/reproducibility/exploitability/affected users/discoverability; STRIDE: spoofing/tampering/repudiation/information disclosure/denial of service/elevation of privilege; CVSS: Common Vulnerability Scoring System) along with more advanced approaches that emulate offensive steps. Sharing cyber data is performed by government agencies (e.g., US Department of Homeland Security) along with information analysis centers (e.g., Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center [MS-ISAC]). In addition to managing known threat data across an attack process, threat evaluation is performed via methodological evaluation of system-level vulnerabilities using model/architecture descriptions (e.g., system modeling language [SysML]) and rolling up developing threat descriptions through techniques like the US Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Analytics Repository (DoDCAR).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Risk bow-tie,Confidentiality,integrity,availability (CIA),NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF),Engineering,"Cyber-physical systems, IoT","Signal, Image and Speech Processing","Communications Engineering, Networks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Computer security control (CSC),DoD Cyber Analytics Repository (DoDCAR),,,,,,,Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII),Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS),Australian Signal Directorate Essential 8,Cyber Threat Framework (CTF),Damage/reproducibility/exploitability/affected users/discoverability (DREAD),Spoofing/tampering/repudiation/information disclosure/denial of service/elevation of privilege (STRIDE),Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM),Automated Computer Network Defense (Canada DRDC) (ARMOUR),Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA),Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC),Cyber threat intelligence (CTI)

Today’s Biometrics authentication system can provide highest level of security to the user of the service and the service providers. Today’s uni-modal biometric systems has become mature system and being used for low level to medium level security applications. But, for extremely higher level of security requirements like military base, nuclear plants, research laboratories etc., Finger knuckle image and Retina image based combination can be used, as this combinations provides the highest level of accuracy, low error rates, universality etc. Also the security of Multi-modal biometric templates is very importance as biometric template store vital information of the user. In this research work, Multi-modal Biometric system for higher level security using Finger Knuckle image and Retina image with templates security is developed, experiments are carried out and results are calculated using PolyU database for Finger Knuckle image and DRIVE for Retina images. A Finger Knuckle Image processing starts with Median Filtering, CLAHE method and Canny edge detection. The features extraction is carried using SURF feature method. Once the finger knuckle image template is generated, it is encrypted using RSA algorithm and stored in database. The Retina Image Processing is carried out by applying Green channel followed by Gaussian filtering, CLAHE method is applied on outcome of Gaussian filtering. SURF features set is extracted from retina ROI. Retina image template is generated which is later encrypted using RSA algorithm. The final experiment shows that genuine acceptance rate = 100% is achieved for threshold value 0.35 and False Acceptance Rate is only 1%.

Ransomware also uses domain generator algorithms (DGA) to generate new domains for the command and control server (C&C), they constantly exploit new vulnerabilities, and they use various infection vectors. Thus, for an organization to protect itself, an adaptive security architecture is required to constantly monitor the network so as to detect new ransomware infection at an early stage such that it can be blocked before encryption of files occur. This approach is a defence in depth approach which supplements the network defences such as patch management, anti-virus software, intrusion detection, firewalls, and content filtering. A framework for the implementation of the adaptive security architecture model using open source software is presented and the proposed framework is tested against the WannaCry and Petya ransomware.

This is achieved by sharing of resources and service instances among multiple “tenants” of the cloud-hosted application. However, supporting multi-tenancy adds more complexity to SaaS applications required capabilities. Security is one of these key requirements that must be addressed when engineering multi-tenant SaaS applications. The sharing of resources among tenants—i.e. multi-tenancy—increases tenants’ concerns about the security of their cloud-hosted assets. Compounding this, existing traditional security engineering approaches do not fit well with the multi-tenancy application model where tenants and their security requirements often emerge after the applications and services were first developed. The resultant applications do not usually support diverse security capabilities based on different tenants’ needs, some of which may change at run-time i.e. after cloud application deployment. We introduce a novel model-driven security engineering approach for multi-tenant, cloud-hosted SaaS applications. Our approach is based on externalizing security from the underlying SaaS application, allowing both application/service and security to evolve at runtime. Multiple security sets can be enforced on the same application instance based on different tenants’ security requirements. We use abstract models to capture service provider and multiple tenants’ security requirements and then generate security integration and configurations at runtime. We use dependency injection and dynamic weaving via Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to integrate security within critical application/service entities at runtime. We explain our approach, architecture and implementation details, discuss a usage example, and present an evaluation of our approach on a set of open source web applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Software-as-a-service,Model-driven engineering,Adaptive-security,Security engineering,Tenant-oriented security,Computer Science,Artificial Intelligence,Software Engineering/Programming and Operating Systems,,,,,0928-8910,1573-7535,21,2,Regular,,187,224,10515,2014-03-21,2014-04,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering this fact is essential in the design of real-time embedded systems which have limited resources. To ensure correct design of these systems, it is important to also take into account impacts of security features on other non-functional requirements, such as performance and energy consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to perform trade-off analysis among non-functional requirements to establish balance among them. In this paper, we target the timing requirements of real-time embedded systems, and introduce an approach for choosing appropriate encryption algorithms at runtime, to achieve satisfaction of timing requirements in an adaptive way, by monitoring and keeping a log of their behaviors. The approach enables the system to adopt a less or more time consuming (but presumably stronger) encryption algorithm, based on the feedback on previous executions of encryption processes.

Due to availability of a large number of public modes, the concept of multi modal transport has led to success in Delhi and other Indian metropolitan cities. Integration and Interchange are two important components of multi modal transport system and hence security perceptions of the commuters’ at interchange need to be assessed for implementation of both general and specific security measures. In this context, qualitative model based on perceived relative importance of five security attributes of commuters’ at metro bus interchange has been developed. It is suggested that public transport sector has to make efforts and design the system to prepare and protect passengers and infrastructure. The other non-transport factors such as built environment, design, staff skills, awareness, regular inspection, uninterrupted power supply, etc can contribute to make public transport systems more secure. It is important to have policy level co-ordination among various operators and facilitators to follow up actions in emergency situations.

Previous work on fully collusion resistant broadcast encryption systems with very short ciphertexts was limited to considering only static security. First, we present a new definition of security that we call semi-static security and show a generic “two-key” transformation from semi-statically secure systems to adaptively secure systems that have comparable-size ciphertexts. Using bilinear maps, we then construct broadcast encryption systems that are semi-statically secure in the standard model and have constant-size ciphertexts. Our semi-static constructions work when the number of indices or identifiers in the system is polynomial in the security parameter. For identity-based broadcast encryption, where the number of potential indices or identifiers may be exponential, we present the first adaptively secure system with sublinear ciphertexts.

This paper introduces a novel mitigation scheme, TRAPS, whereby the victim verifies source address authenticity by performing reconfiguration for traffic redirection and informing high ongoing-traffic correspondents. The spoofed sources are not informed and will continue to use the old configuration to send packets, which can then be easily filtered off. Adaptive rate-limiting can be used on the remaining traffic, which may be attack packets with randomly-generated spoofed IP addresses. We compare our various approaches for achieving TRAPS functionality. The end-host approach is based on standard Mobile IP protocol and does not require any new protocols, changes to Internet routers, nor prior traffic flow characterizations. It supports adaptive, real-time and automatic responses to DDoS attacks.

Secure OS based on Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is one of the systems that reflect these techniques. The RBAC system controls access to system resources based on roles. Recently, many systems employ more fine-grained access control on system resources to enhance system security. However, this approach in access control level may cause unexpected problems, since most systems acquire system resources through system call that is hooked on kernel. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The proposed Autonomic Protection System (APS) supports fine-grained intrusion detection. It resides above Secure OS based on RBAC that provides general-grained access control. The system detects intrusions using security policy based on RBAC model. The system performs double checking for intrusions using positive and negative intrusion detection policy. Additionally, as one of active responses, the system supports the self-adaptation of security policy depending on various computing environments. Therefore, the system can detect intrusions more accurately and respond to the attacks actively and appropriately.",International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications,Springer,iccsa,DBLP,iccsa,Springer,iccsa2004,ICCSA,4,,Assisi,IT,Italy,2004,5,14,2004,5,17,,,,,,,,,,,,Access Control,Intrusion Detection,Security Policy,Intrusion Detection System,Autonomic Computing,Computer Science,Theory of Computation,Programming Techniques,Mathematics of Computing,Information Systems and Communication Service,Computer Applications,Computational Mathematics and Numerical Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
