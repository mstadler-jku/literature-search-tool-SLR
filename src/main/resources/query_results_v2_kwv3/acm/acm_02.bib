abstract = {We propose a method for dynamic security domain scaling on SMPs that offers both highly scalable performance and high security for future high-end embedded systems. Its most important feature is its highly efficient use of processor resources, accomplished by dynamically changing the number of processors within a security domain in response to application load requirements. Two new technologies make this scaling possible without any virtualization software: 1) self-transition management and 2) unified virtual address mapping. Evaluations show that this domain control provides highly scalable performance and incurs almost no performance overhead in security domains. The increase in binary code size is less than 40KB, and the time required for individual state transitions is of a single-millisecond order. This scaling is the first in the world to make possible dynamic changing of the number of processors within a security domain on an ARM SMP.},

abstract = {Relationship-based access control (ReBAC) policies can express intricate protection requirements in terms of relationships among users and resources (which can be modeled as a graph). Such policies are useful in domains beyond online social networks. However, given the updating graph of user and resources in a system and expressive conditions in access control policy rules, it can be very challenging for security administrators to envision what can (or cannot) happen as the protection system evolves.In this paper, we introduce the security analysis problem for this class of policies, where we seek to answer security queries about future states of the system graph and authorizations that are decided accordingly. Towards achieving this goal, we propose a state-transition model of a ReBAC protection system, called RePM. We discuss about formulation of security analysis queries in RePM and present our initial results for a limited version of this model.},

As a consequence, decentralized mechanisms are required to ensure security in such architectures. Decentralized Information Flow Control (DIFC) is a mechanism to control information flow in distributed systems. This article presents and discusses several improvements to an adaptive decentralized information flow approach that incorporates trust for decentralized systems to provide security. Adaptive Trust-Aware Decentralized Information Flow (AT-DIFC+) combines decentralized information flow control mechanisms, trust-based methods, and decentralized control architectures to control and enforce information flow in an open, decentralized system. We strengthen our approach against newly discovered attacks and provide additional information about its reconfiguration, decentralized control architectures, and reference implementation. We evaluate the effectiveness and performance of AT-DIFC+ on two case studies and perform additional experiments and to gauge the mitigations’ effectiveness against the identified attacks.},

abstract = {A Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition was conducted this spring with five universities fielding teams. This event was designed to provide student led teams a simulated operational business environment in which they could test their skills at information security and system operation. This three day event included external hackers attacking the student networks, as well as business users placing operational and administrative demands on the teams. Teams were scored based on their ability to maintain mandated business services, keeping hackers out and answering business scenario injects. The objective was to provide an environment where the teams could exercise their information technology abilities and do so in an operational mode where most information was not freely provided, but must be uncovered and discovered by the students in real time. Issues such as prioritization, resource allocation and technical skill application were tested using real world examples on a known instrumented network. The objective of providing feedback to each team as to its skill level and abilities was achieved and then some over the course of this successful event. Lessons were learned which are being used to move this local event to a national level event.},

This paper considers one class of adaptive systems-those that adapt application-level security mechanisms. Nowadays, adaptive software security is gaining greater attention as a way to balance the tradeoff between systems security and IT infrastructure overhead. Several adaptive security systems have been developed recently supporting hardware-level to application-level reconfiguration. This paper surveys four adaptive application-level security systems and evaluates them in terms of how well they support critical security services (i.e. authentication, authorization, and tolerance) and what level of adaptation they achieve. Based on our evaluation results, we provide recommendations for future research.},

abstract = {Service-Oriented Architecture is an architectural style where different heterogeneous components share information with each other by using special types of messages based on the protocol known as Simple Object Access Protocol. Various technologies, such as Common Object Request Broker Architecture, Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition, Java Message Service etc. are applied to realize Service-Oriented Architecture for different applications. Besides these approaches, two other techniques, REpresentational State Transfer, and web services are applied for the realization of Service-Oriented Architecture. Web services provide a platform independent communication scheme between applications. The security preservation among the composition of services is an important task for Service-Oriented Architecture. In this study, an attempt is made to incorporate security features in Service- Oriented Architecture with the help of software security patterns. This scheme is described by developing an architectural model integrated with security goals and security patterns. The structural and behavioral aspects of composition of web services incorporated with security features are presented using a Unified Modeling Language class diagram and a sequence diagram respectively. At the end of this study, an evaluation is performed between identified security patterns and critical security properties along with Service-Oriented Architecture design principles. A case study of an online banking system is considered to explain the use of security patterns.},

A fundamental aspect of a security model is a proof that validates that every state reachable from a secure initial state is secure. A sequential security model assumes that every command that acts as a state transition executes sequentially, while a concurrent security model assumes that multiple commands execute concurrently. This paper presents a security model called the Centralized-Parallel-Distributed model (CPD model) that defines security for logically, or physically centralized, parallel, and distributed systems. The purpose of the CPD model is to define concurrency conditions that guarentee that a concurrent system cannot reach a state in which privileges are configured in a nonsecure manner. As an example, the conditions are used to construct a representation of a distributed system.},

abstract = {An operating system relies heavily on its security model to defend against malicious attacks. It has been one of the hottest research domains for decades to validate security models' correctness by formal methods during the development of security operating systems. However, current studies on the formal verification of security models are sometimes too sophisticated for the developers of operating systems, who are usually not experts in mathematical reasoning and proving. So representing a security model in UML becomes a compromise choice for the developers' verification work during system developing. In this paper, we propose a new method to verify the security policy model against the security goals using model checker SPIN and UML modeling language. Given a security policy model and the security property to be validated, our approach leverages UML class diagrams and statechart diagrams to specify its state model and its state transitions respectively. Then we translate these UML diagrams into the input language of SPIN automatically, as well as the security property. The conformance between the security goal and security model can finally be analyzed by SPIN. We proved the effectiveness of our approach by checking the violation of confidentiality of the DBLP model.},

abstract = {Various underwater communication applications are proposed to maintain different economic, environmental, and security gains. To support the high quality of service (QoS) requirements of the involved communication tasks, one solution is to rely on multi-mode (i.e., acoustic, optical, magnetic induction (MI), and radio frequency (RF)) communication systems. Such a multi-mode communication system can take advantage of the complementary modes’ features, to obtain QoS requirements per transmission flow. However, challenges including high system cost and coordination between different modes need to be addressed. Therefore, in this paper a Universal Underwater Software Defined Radio (UniSDR) architecture is proposed that realizes joint operation of different modes, in order to deal with the latest use cases demands. Detailed description of the UniSDR architecture is presented. Novelty of the architecture provides flexibility, allowing designer to build a radio that includes any set of modes, which can operate jointly by exchanging data, control and synchronization. A numerical evaluation is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed UniSDR architecture. It clearly shows that the utilization of UniSDR allows to decrease the transmission latency and improve energy efficiency, while maintaining the reliability and robustness.},

The approach considers internal event data related to the target system (e.g., users, physical, and logical resources, IP addresses, port numbers, etc.), and external event data related to the attacker (e.g., knowledge, motivation, skills, etc.) that can be obtained a priori and a posteriori. Internal data is used to model the base of the pyramid, whereas external data is used to model its height. In addition, the approach considers state transitions taken by the attacker to model the steps of a multi-stage attack to reach to its final goal. As a result, for each modeled state, new countermeasures are evaluated and the attacker's knowledge a posteriori changes accordingly, making it possible to evaluate the impact of the attack at time Ti, where i denotes the stage at which the attack is executed. A graphical representation of the impact of each evaluated event is depicted for visualization purposes. A use case of a cyber-physical system is proposed at the end of the paper to illustrate the applicability of the proposed geometrical model.},

The Web Observatory provides an active decentralised ecosystem for datasets and applications based on a number Web Observatory sites, each of which can run in a different administrative domain. On a Web Observatory site users can publish and securely access datasets across domains via a harmonised API and reverse proxies for access control. However, that API provides a different interface to that of the databases on which datasets are stored and, consequently, existing applications that consume data from specific databases require major modification to be added to the Web Observatory ecosystem. In this paper we propose a lightweight architecture called Porter Proxy to address this concern. Porter Proxy exposes the same interfaces as databases as requested by the users while enforcing access control. Characteristics of the proposed Porter Proxy architecture are evaluated based on adversarial scenario-handling in Web Observatory eco-system.},

abstract = {The Domain Name System (DNS) has a direct impact on the performance and dependability of nearly all aspects of interactions on the Internet. DNS relies on a delegation-based architecture, where resolution of a name to its IP address requires resolving the names of the servers responsible for that name. The graphs of the inter-dependencies that exist between name servers associated with each zone are called Dependency Graphs. We constructed a DNS Dependency Model as a unified representation of these Dependency Graphs. We utilize a set of Structural Metrics defined over this model as indicators of external quality attributes of the domain name system. We explore the inter-metric and inter-quality relations further in order to quantify the indicative power of each metric. We apply some machine learning algorithms in order to construct Prediction Models of the perceived quality attributes of the operational system out of the structural metrics of the model. Assessing these quality attributes at an early stage of the design/deployment enables us to avoid the implications of defective and low-quality designs and deployment choices and identify configuration changes that might improve the availability, security, stability and resiliency postures of the DNS.},

abstract = {As business is getting sensitive to knowledge, the importance of the business contents that has business information and knowledge is rapidly increasing. Moreover, this business information includes diverse sensitive data, which should be handled in secured way.In sociological terms and information technical terms, it is important to have attention for the phenomenon that occurred in South Korea. Over the last decade in South Korea, many firms have been trying to equip some specialized security system for their internal content, which is known as 'Document (Contents) Centralization System'.This 'Document Centralization System' business became one of the biggest and hottest businesses in the area of Enterprise Contents Management Business and Contents Security Business in South Korea. Surprisingly, this system doesn't have any specialized security technologies. Moreover, it is not limited to digital security technology, but also some industrial security consideration based on business behavior. Additionally, this system needs the concept of serviced security.In order to understand this phenomenon and system effectively, it is not enough only to study information technology and security. Except for individual security technologies, we need to study other many sub themes, such as knowledge contents business, business behavior pattern in terms of industrial security, smart work business and knowledge product service system.Finally, this paper presented the adaptive security system in terms of management of technology, which means that security need to be managed, not installed.. This system has diverse characteristics, such as the convergence capability of digital security technologies, flexible system mechanism corresponding to business behavior and effective cloud system which is capable of servicing of knowledge contents.},

abstract = {TheChain is a solution to many problems such as monopoly, heavy state transition, and security vulnerabilities. TheChain solves these problems by introducing the intersection of regions as an incentive before allowing validators to nest a client directory. Intersecting their operating territories forces them to keep a watch over each other. The definition of privacy can take many forms, starting from the right to be forgotten beside being away from public attention. Although the pseudonymity of the user within the network can enhance the user's privacy, several pieces of research have studied the techniques to take advantage of the network structure to identify the users of pseudonyms. Moreover, two models have been used to record the updated exchange of values within the blockchain system, which are the unspent transaction output (UTXO) and the balance model. The UTXO suffers from duplication of information and the balance model suffers from having a single point of entry. This paper introduces TheCoin model that defines the protocol of the exchange of valuable datum within TheChain system. The solution has introduced a novel approach of initiating the transaction from the receiver side by taking advantage of mobile agents empowering a topology hiding to the network. Billing within the platform has been introduced to allow advanced contractual logic to be adopted into the system on the information level. Moreover, traceable fuzziness has been used to eliminate duplication. The paper presents an evaluation of the TheCoin model in terms of system security, block size, and search performance.},

First, the policy file is formalized into a policy instance logic specification through logical abstraction, and then the policy instance logic specification Perform model check with the policy abstract logic specification developed by the policy designer to realize the pre-check verification of the consistency of the police file. After the completion of the pre-check and verification, the policy will be executed for the policy manager to make a decision on the execution point of the policy. At this time, the system operating state data intercepted by the policy enforcement point and the embedded system's security, compliance, and legal treaty form process specifications are used to perform model post-check to achieve the security and alarm after the implementation of the policy. Through the combination of pre-check and post-check, the evaluation and testing of the policy and effectiveness of the zero-trust security policy are finally realized.},

abstract = {With the wind power grid-connected capacity and the amount of curtailment continue to increase, influence factor analysis of wind power consumption becomes more active. Firstly, this paper analyzes the wind power curtailment mechanism affected by power grid operation mode in CHP system. Then, an optimal dispatch model of the CHP system is established. It includes power and heat network security constraints, units' operating states, power network topological changes and the penalty cost of electric &amp; heat load loss. Finally, this paper analyzes the influences of power grid operation mode on wind power consumption by case simulations. Study shows the reason for wind power curtailment is not always single in a dispatch cycle. The CHP unit "thermo-electric coupling" constraints and power network safety constraints may alternately or simultaneously cause wind power curtailment. The unit startup plan and the power network topology all affect the reasons, the periods and the rate of wind power curtailment. In addition, the changes of grid operation mode due to quit equipment in different periods also affect the wind power curtailment rate. Meanwhile, the amount can be reduced by prioritized starting standby units in plant which occurs unit shutdown, and putting in standby transmission lines near the wind farm},

abstract = {Radio configuration (R-CFG) files for software defined radio (SDR) devices can be downloaded over the air, allowing these devices to support multi-mode functionality using a single transceiver. SDR device manufacturers are likely to provide the R-CFGs, which may contain proprietary information. In such cases, it is necessary to secure the server/SDR device connection during the R-CFG download. Therefore, a protocol to securely connect manufacturer's server and SDR devices, called LSSL, is proposed. The LSSL is a lightweight protocol based on the SSL protocol, but it takes up less bandwidth, thus, it is more suitable for SDR handheld devices operating under low-capabilities, low-bandwidth and error-prone wireless links. However, securing the R-CFG download connection does not guarantee that a valid R-CFG, that is, an R-CFG that has been approved by the regulatory agency, has been downloaded. In order to install only valid R-CFGs, a secure download protocol is presented. The secure protocol includes, besides the LSSL, steps of mutual authentication, public/private key mechanisms for data encryption and decryption, and fingerprint calculations to check data integrity. Finally, the secure protocol is analyzed and shown to be deadlock and livelock-free, and to properly terminate. Experiments using Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) are performed to compare the LSSL and the SSL, and to demonstrate the feasibility of the secure protocol.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a client-oriented web alteration detection system that uses the changed state of links between the past and current versions of a browsing web page. Some measures against malicious web page alterations have been developed, such as URL-blacklist based access control. The limitations of such measures, however, are the coverage and timeliness. It is very difficult to capture all maliciously altered web page data on the Internet. A time delay from when an attacker alters a web page to when a browser blocks access to the web page is unavoidable. We focus on a page alteration such as a code injection or a page modification without a change in the visual layout. Such an alteration may lead users to experience further security threats. To detect altered web pages, whenever a user views a web page, our system extracts the link-based feature data from the page and stores it in a database. In addition, if the database has the feature data of a browsing web page from a previous access time, the system extracts the change in state of all links on the web page based on both the previous and current page content. Moreover, the results are provided to the users through a visual representation. Our system assists web-browsing users to remain aware of malicious alterations to a browsing web page. We believe that our system can engage web-browsing users to monitor web page alterations.},

abstract = {This paper discusses our experience evaluating attack paths and security controls in commonly used, real-world ICS safety system architectures. Specifically, we sought to determine if an SIS-mediated architecture could provide better protection against unauthorized and malicious safety instrument configuration changes than could a MUX-mediated architecture. An assessment question-driven approach was layered on top of standard penetration assessment methods. Test cases were planned around the questions and a sample set of vendor products typically used in the oil and gas sector. Four systems were composed from different product subsets and were assessed using the test cases. We analyzed results from the four assessments to illuminate issues that existed regardless of system composition. Analysis revealed recurring vulnerabilities that exist in all safety systems due to issues in the design of safety instruments and the HART protocol. We found that device-native hardware write-protections provide the best defense, followed by SIS write protections. We concluded that, when using SIS security controls, an SIS-mediated system can protect against unauthorized device reconfigurations better than can a MUX-based system. When SIS security controls are not used, there is no added security benefit. We present lessons learned for ICS stakeholders and for people who are interested in conducting this kind of evaluation.},

We describe the design of an incentive based cooperation scheme to create a global trusted community which is more accountable and hence less vulnerable to attacks and abuse. Foresight utilizes this infrastructure to share a global threat view in order to detect unknown threats and isolate them. We describe a novel behavioral signature scheme to extract a generalized footprint for multi-modal threats.

Rather than exploiting an incorrect implementation of the ISA, these attacks leverage the undocumented implementation-specific speculation behavior of high-performance microarchitectures to affect the extra-architectural state of the machine (e.g., caches).Inspired by these novel speculation-based attacks, we argue it is time to rethink the traditional ISA layers. Programmers and security professionals need a framework to reason about the effects of speculation and other microarchitectural performance optimizations. We propose judiciously extending the ISA to include the extra-architectural state so that an ISA implementation either completely squashes all system state changes caused by mis-speculated instructions or the potential changes are rigorously documented. We hope this new framework will give architects and security researchers tools to reduce the likelihood of future surprise vulnerabilities.},

abstract = {Integrity is a crucial property in current computing systems. Due to natural or human-made (malicious and non-malicious) faults this property can be violated. Therefore, many methodologies and patterns that check or verify the integrity of systems or data have been introduced. However, integrity as a property cannot be identified directly. Existing methodologies tackle this problem by identifying other, computable, properties of the system and use a policy that describes how these properties reflect the integrity of the overall system. It is thus a critical task to select the right properties that reflect the integrity of a system in such a way that given integrity requirements are met. To ease this process, we introduce two new patterns, Static Integrity Properties and Dynamic Integrity Properties to classify the properties. Static Integrity Properties are used to ensure the integrity of a component prior it's use (e.g., the integrity of an executable binary), while Dynamic Integrity Properties are used to ensure the integrity of a component during run-time (e.g., properties that reflect the component's behavior or state transitions). Based on an exemplary embedded control system, we show typical use cases to help the system or software architect to choose the right class of integrity properties for the targeted system.},

In a novel privacy framework we proposed, the questions are partially addressed with the utilization of a set of theoretical models e.g. hidden markov model, differential privacy and information flow with belief.

abstract = {Novel trusted execution support, as offered by Intel's Software Guard eXtensions (SGX), embeds seamlessly into user space applications by establishing regions of encrypted memory, called enclaves. Enclaves comprise code and data that is executed under special protection of the CPU and can only be accessed via an enclave defined interface. To facilitate the usability of this new system abstraction, Intel offers a software development kit (SGX SDK). While the SDK eases the use of SGX, it misses appropriate programming support for inter-enclave interaction, and demands to hardcode the exact use of trusted execution into applications, which restricts flexibility.This paper proposes EActors, an actor framework that is tailored to SGX and offers a more seamless, flexible and efficient use of trusted execution -- especially for applications demanding multiple enclaves. EActors disentangles the interaction with enclaves and, among them, from costly execution mode transitions. It features lightweight fine-grained parallelism based on the concept of actors, thereby avoiding costly SGX SDK provided synchronisation constructs. Finally, EActors offers a high degree of freedom to execute actors, either untrusted or trusted, depending on security requirements and performance demands. We implemented two use cases on top of EActors: (i) a secure instant messaging service, and (ii) a secure multi-party computation service. Both illustrate the ability of EActors to seamlessly and effectively build secure applications. Furthermore, our performance evaluation results show that securing the messaging service with EActors improves performance compared to the vanilla versions of JabberD2 and ejabberd by up to 40x.},

abstract = {Modern System-on-chip (SoC) architectures are a heterogeneous mix of microprocessors, custom accelerators, memories, interfaces, peripherals, and other resources. These resources communicate using complex on-chip interconnect networks that attempt to quickly and efficiently arbitrate memory transactions whose behaviors can vary drastically depending on the current mode of operation and system operating state. Security- and safety-critical applications require access control policies that define how these resources interact to ensure that malicious and unsafe behaviors do not occur. The process of defining and then verifying the security of these access control policies relies heavily on manual effort. This paper describes an automated methodology to generate, verify, and rank secure SoC access control policies. Our methodology targets access control policies for AKER access control systems.},

abstract = {The sharing of last-level cache (LLC) among different CPU cores makes cache vulnerable to side channel attacks. An attacker can get private information about co-running applications (victims) by monitoring their accesses in LLC. Cache side channel attacks can be mitigated by partitioning cache between the victim and attacker. However, previous partition works either make weak assumptions about the attacker's strength or force their security mechanisms and thus overhead to every user on the system, regardless of their security requirement.We argue that offering security protection as a service is a better choice for secure cache design. To achieve this, we propose Invisible-Victim cache (IVcache), a new cache partition design targeting both the original LLC attack and the new variant. IVcache classifies all security domains on the system as protected and unprotected. For LLC accesses from protected domains, IVcache handles cache state changes in a slightly different way to make those accesses invisible to any other security domains. We implement and evaluate IVcache in Gem5. The experimental results show that IVcache can defend against real-world attacks, and that it introduces negligible performance overhead to protected domains and no overhead to unprotected domains.},

abstract = {Side-channel attacks try to breach confidentiality and retrieve critical secrets through the side channels. Cache memories are a potential source of information leakage through side-channel attacks, many of which have been proposed. Meanwhile, different cache architectures have also been proposed to defend against these attacks. However, there are currently no means for comparing and evaluating the effectiveness of different defense solutions against these attacks.In this paper, we propose a novel method to evaluate a system's vulnerability to side-channel attacks. We establish side-channel leakage models based on the non-interference property. Then we define how the security aspects of a cache architecture can be modeled as a finite-state machine (FSM) with state transitions that cause interference. We use mutual information to quantitatively reveal potential side-channel leakage of the architectures, and allow comparison of these architectures for their relative vulnerabilities to side-channel attacks. We use real attacks to validate our results.},

abstract = {Nonlinear dynamics and graph theory may provide a theorem-based path to improve design security and aid detection of anomalous events in cyber applications. Using side-channel information such as power taken from underlying computer components and analyzing noisy data such as timing, we ask the question of whether such data can reveal anomalous activity or verify the changing dynamics of an underlying computer system. Takens' theorem in nonlinear dynamics allows reconstruction of topologically invariant, time-delay-embedding states from the computer dynamics in a sufficiently high-dimensional space. The resultant dynamical states are vertices, and the state-to-state transitions are edges in a graph. Graph theorems guarantee topologically invariant measures to quantify the dynamical changes, based on the applications that are executing. This paper highlights recent applications of the phase-space analysis technique in the non-cyber realm (forewarning of biomedical events and equipment failures), and proposes new applications that would bolster cyber event detection.},

abstract = {A Moving Target (MT) defense constantly changes a system's attack surface, in an attempt to limit the usefulness of the reconnaissance the attacker has collected. One approach to this defense strategy is to intermittently change a system's configuration. These changes must maintain functionality and security, while also being diverse. Finding suitable configuration changes that form a MT defense is challenging. There are potentially a large number of individual configurations' settings to consider, without a full understanding of the settings' interdependencies.Evolution-based algorithms, which formulate better solutions from good solutions, can be used to create a MT defense. New configurations are created based on the security of previous configurations and can be periodically implemented to change the system's attack surface. This approach not only has the ability to discover new, more secure configurations, but is also proactive and resilient since it can continually adapt to the current environment in a fashion similar to systems found in nature.This article presents and compares two genetic algorithms to create a MT defense. The primary difference between the two is based on their approaches to mutation. One mutates values, and the other modifies the domains from which values are chosen.},

abstract = {Many important public services, such as security and public health, as well as the modern tactical military scenarios, rely on Service-oriented Architectures (SoAs) and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components to enable the quick development and deployment of distributed services to respond quickly, reduce costs, and ease system integration. However, SoAs make use of verbose networking technologies and require reliable and relatively high bandwidth communications. Tactical scenarios normally cannot rely on such infrastructure and events like natural disasters can severely damage the network infrastructure in rural and urban environments. Thus, there is a need to develop solutions that provide SoA-based application and services running on heterogeneous and often constrained devices that compose tactical and mobile ad-hoc networks with Quality of Service (QoS) levels that meet their requirements. This paper presents the QoS-enabling features and the gateway operational mode (GM) of ACM NetProxy, the network proxy component of a communications middleware specifically developed to support applications in challenged networks. GM allows nodes in an ad-hoc wireless network to be quickly organized and to shape outbound communications to reduce bandwidth consumption and provide QoS. Experimental results obtained during a test in a field demonstration event show its efficiency.},

The modern Web architecture emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. In this paper, we introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, developed as an abstract model of the Web architecture to guide our redesign and definition of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifiers. We describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. We then compare the abstract model to the currently deployed Web architecture in order to elicit mismatches between the existing protocols and the applications they are intended to support.},

abstract = {Penetration testing is a well-established practical concept for the identification of potentially exploitable security weaknesses and an important component of a security audit. Providing a holistic security assessment for networks consisting of several hundreds hosts is hardly feasible though without some sort of mechanization. Mitigation, prioritizing counter-measures subject to a given budget, currently lacks a solid theoretical understanding and is hence more art than science. In this work, we propose the first approach for conducting comprehensive what-if analyses in order to reason about mitigation in a conceptually well-founded manner. To evaluate and compare mitigation strategies, we use simulated penetration testing, i.e., automated attack-finding, based on a network model to which a subset of a given set of mitigation actions, e.g., changes to the network topology, system updates, configuration changes etc. is applied. Using Stackelberg planning, we determine optimal combinations that minimize the maximal attacker success (similar to a Stackelberg game), and thus provide a well-founded basis for a holistic mitigation strategy. We show that these Stackelberg planning models can largely be derived from network scan, public vulnerability databases and manual inspection with various degrees of automation and detail, and we simulate mitigation analysis on networks of different size and vulnerability.},

abstract = {Modern computer networks based on the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm are becoming increasingly complex and often require frequent configuration changes in order to react to traffic fluctuations. It is essential that forwarding policies are preserved not only before and after the configuration update but also at any moment during the inherently distributed execution of such an update. We present Kaki, a&nbsp;Petri game based tool for automatic synthesis of switch batches which can be updated in parallel without violating a given (regular) forwarding policy like waypointing or service chaining. Kaki guarantees to find the minimum number of concurrent batches and supports both splittable and nonsplittable flow forwarding. In order to achieve optimal performance, we introduce two novel optimisation techniques based on static analysis: decomposition into independent subproblems and identification of switches that can be collectively updated in the same batch. These techniques considerably improve the performance of our tool Kaki, relying on TAPAAL’s verification engine for Petri games as its backend. Experiments on a large benchmark of real networks from the Internet Topology Zoo database demonstrate that Kaki outperforms the state-of-the-art tools Netstack and FLIP. Kaki computes concurrent update synthesis significantly faster than Netstack and compared to FLIP, it provides shorter (and provably optimal) concurrent update sequences at similar runtimes.},

abstract = {Secure and usable user authentication on mobile headsets is a challenging problem. The miniature-sized touchpad on such devices becomes a hurdle to user interactions that impact usability. However, the most common authentication methods, i.e., the standard QWERTY virtual keyboard or mid-air inputs to enter passwords are highly vulnerable to shoulder surfing attacks. In this paper, we present PassWalk, a keyboard-less authentication system leveraging multi-modal inputs on mobile headsets. PassWalk demonstrates the feasibility of user authentication driven by the user's gaze and lateral shifts (i.e., footsteps) simultaneously. The keyboard-less authentication interface in PassWalk enables users to accomplish highly mobile inputs of graphical passwords, containing digital overlays and physical objects. We conduct an evaluation with 22 recruited participants (15 legitimate users and 7 attackers). Our results show that PassWalk provides high security (only 1.1% observation attacks were successful) with a mean authentication time of 8.028s, which outperforms the commercial method of using the QWERTY virtual keyboard (21.5% successful attacks) and a research prototype LookUnLock (5.5% successful attacks). Additionally, PassWalk entails a significantly smaller workload on the user than the current commercial methods.},

abstract = {Botnets continue to be a threat to organizations, thus various machine learning-based botnet detectors have been proposed. However, the capability of such systems in detecting new or unseen botnets is crucial to ensure its robustness against the rapid evolution of botnets. Moreover, it prolongs the effectiveness of the system in detecting bots, avoiding frequent and time-consuming classifier re-training. We present BOTection, a privacy-preserving bot detection system that models the bot network flow behavior as a Markov Chain. The Markov Chain state transitions capture the bots' network behavior using high-level flow features as states, producing content-agnostic and encryption resilient behavioral features. These features are used to train a classifier to first detect flows produced by bots, and then identify their bot families. We evaluate our system on a dataset of over 7M malicious flows from 12 botnet families, showing its capability of detecting bots' network traffic with 99.78% F-measure and classifying it to a malware family with a 99.09% F-measure. Notably, due to the modeling of general bot network behavior by the Markov Chains, BOTection can detect traffic belonging to unseen bot families with an F-measure of 93.03% making it robust against malware evolution.},

Recently a serious eavesdropping attack, which exploits the CSI feedback of the FDD system, is discovered in MU-MIMO networks. In this paper, we firstly show a similar eavesdropping attack for the TDD system is also possible by proposing a novel, feasible attack approach. Following it, a malicious user can eavesdrop on other users' downloads by transforming training sequences. To prevent this attack, we propose a secure CSI estimation scheme for instantaneous CSI. Furthermore, we extend this scheme to achieve adaptive security when CSI is relatively statistical. We have implemented our scheme for both uplink and downlink of MU-MIMO and performed a series of experiments. Results show that our secure CSI estimation scheme is highly effective in preventing downlink leakage against malicious users.},

abstract = {Circular statistics present a new technique to analyse the time patterns of events in the field of cyber security. We apply this technique to analyse incidents of malware infections detected by network monitoring. In particular we are interested in the daily and weekly variations of these events.Based on "live" data provided by Spamhaus, we examine the hypothesis that attacks on four countries are distributed uniformly over 24 hours. Specifically, we use Rayleigh and Watson tests. While our results are mainly exploratory, we are able to demonstrate that the attacks are not uniformly distributed, nor do they follow a Poisson distribution as reported in other research. Our objective in this is to identify a distribution that can be used to establish risk metrics.Moreover, our approach provides a visual overview of the time patterns' variation, indicating when attacks are most likely. This will assist decision makers in cyber security to allocate resources or estimate the cost of system monitoring during high risk periods.Our results also reveal that the time patterns are influenced by the total number of attacks. Networks subject to a large volume of attacks exhibit bimodality while one case, where attacks were at relatively lower rate, showed a multi-modal daily variation.},

abstract = {Continuous location authentication (CLA) seeks to continuously and automatically verify the physical presence of legitimate users in a protected indoor area. CLA can play an important role in contexts where access to electrical or physical resources must be limited to physically present legitimate users. In this paper, we present WearRF-CLA, a novel CLA scheme built upon increasingly popular wrist wearables and UHF RFID systems. WearRF-CLA explores the observation that human daily routines in a protected indoor area comprise a sequence of human-states (e.g., walking and sitting) that follow predictable state transitions. Each legitimate WearRF-CLA user registers his/her RFID tag and also wrist wearable during system enrollment. After the user enters a protected area, WearRF-CLA continuously collects and processes the gyroscope data of the wrist wearable and the phase data of the RFID tag signals to verify three factors to determine the user's physical presence/absence without explicit user involvement: (1) the tag ID as in a traditional RFID authentication system, (2) the validity of the human-state chain, and (3) the continuous coexistence of the paired wrist wearable and RFID tag with the user. The user passes CLA if and only if all three factors can be validated. Extensive user experiments on commodity smartwatches and UHF RFID devices confirm the very high security and low authentication latency of WearRF-CLA.},

abstract = {This paper examines security capabilities of Android open source operating system based on GNU/Linux and components developed by Google. The focus of this paper is analysis of Android screen-locker and login applications. Many default Android applications can be replaced by new applications, which can offer different interface or add new functionality. Screen-locker is an integral part of Android, and while it cannot be replaced directly, there are ways to implement applications to offer same functionality, and possibly more features. Android 2.2 Device Administration API is tightly coupled with the native screen-locker and login mechanism, allowing for development of robust and adaptive security applications and centralized policy management tools. A new screen-locker and authentication app was created using Device Administration API and is discussed in this paper.},
