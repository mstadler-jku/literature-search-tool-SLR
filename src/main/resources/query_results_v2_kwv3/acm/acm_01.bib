abstract = {Several security mechanisms such as digital signature, timestamp audits and trails, encryption, throttling, filtering, protect secrets etc. are available. These security mechanisms are not completely able to stop malicious attacks. For malicious hackers and attackers it is comparatively easy to exploit security loopholes at the user's end side. Behind such type of problem the main reason is bad software design and its implementation without proper risk analysis and mitigation. So, an idea to model availability states an Availability State Transition Model (ASTM) has been proposed in this article. In ASTM methodology, only design level details is required which can be easily retrieved from the software's design.},

abstract = {Adaptive security systems aim to protect valuable assets in the face of changes in their operational environment. They do so by monitoring and analysing this environment, and deploying security functions that satisfy some protection (security, privacy, or forensic) requirements. In this paper, we suggest that a key characteristic for engineering adaptive security is the topology of the operational environment, which represents a physical and/or a digital space - including its structural relationships, such as containment, proximity, and reachability. For adaptive security, topology expresses a rich representation of context that can provide a system with both structural and semantic awareness of important contextual characteristics. These include the location of assets being protected or the proximity of potentially threatening agents that might harm them. Security-related actions, such as the physical movement of an actor from a room to another in a building, may be viewed as topological changes. The detection of a possible undesired topological change (such as an actor possessing a safe’s key entering the room where the safe is located) may lead to the decision to deploy a particular security control to protect the relevant asset. This position paper advocates topology awareness for more effective engineering of adaptive security. By monitoring changes in topology at runtime one can identify new or changing threats and attacks, and deploy adequate security controls accordingly. The paper elaborates on the notion of topology and provides a vision and research agenda on its role for systematically engineering adaptive security systems.},

abstract = {With the advent of network connectivity and complex software applications, life-critical systems like medical devices are subject to a plethora of security risks and vulnerabilities. Security threats and attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities have been shown to compromise patient safety by hampering essential functionality. This necessitates incorporating security from the very design of software. Isolation of software functionality into different modes and switching between them based on risk assessment, while maintaining a fail-safe mode ensuring device's essential functionality is a compelling design. Formal modeling is an essential ingredient for verification of such a design. Hence, in this paper, we formally model a trustworthy multi-modal framework for life-critical systems security and in turn safety. We formalize a multiple mode based software design approach of operation with a fail-safe mode that maintains critical functionality. We ensure trustworthyness by formalizing a composite risk model incorporated into the design for run-time risk assessment and management.},

abstract = {Person Re-ID is a challenging problem and is gaining more attention due to demands in security, intelligent system and other applications. Most person Re-ID works are vision-based, such as image, video, or broadly speaking, face recognition-based techniques. Recently, several multi-modal person Re-ID datasets were released, including RGB+IR, RGB+text, RGB+WiFi, which shows the potential of the multi-modal sensor-based person Re-ID approach. However, there are several common issues in public datasets, such as short time duration, lack of appearance change, and limited activities, resulting in un-robust models. For example, vision-based Re-ID models are sensitive to appearance change. In this work, a person Re-ID testbed with multi-modal sensors is created, allowing the collection of sensing modalities including RGB, IR, depth, WiFi, radar, and audio. This novel dataset will cover normal daily office activities with large time span over multi-seasons. Initial analytic results are obtained for evaluating different person Re-ID models, based on small datasets collected in this testbed.},

Awareness of the topology of the operating environment of systems as well as its dynamics can support adaptive security more effectively.In this talk I propose the use of Bigraphical Reactive Systems to represent the topology of cyber and physical spaces. I describe how to use this representation to reason about the consequences of the evolution of topological configurations on the satisfaction of security requirements. I also illustrate a planning technique to identify an adaptation strategy to be used at runtime, to circumvent, prevent, or mitigate security requirements violations previously identified.

The paper analyses benefits and challenges of security measuring from the self-adaptive security perspective. Thus, five benefits and three challenges of security metrics in self-adaptive security are described. Furthermore, the paper derives requirements that measuring causes for self-adaptive security.

abstract = {Wireless Body Area Sensor Networks (WBASNs) are networks of low-power sensing objects that collect and send vital signs of a patient using low-rate communication media. They have been originally created to improve the efficiency of e-health applications and they constitute now an important part of the Internet of Things (IoT) by bringing humans into the IoTs. The ASSET (Adaptive Security for Smart Internet of Things in eHealth) project [1] develops risk-based adaptive security methods and mechanisms for IoT in eHealth. The project requires a real-life testbed to evaluate accurately the adaptive security solutions in realistic simulation and use case scenarios. This paper describes the setup of a testbed for adaptive security for the IoT using current commercial off-the-shelf products and open source software. The particular features of the proposed testbed with regard to those published in the literature are underlined. The paper also discusses the validation of the setup through the study of the impact of antenna orientation on energy consumption. To this purpose, an estimation strategy of the energy consumption using the Holt-Winters prediction method has been developed. This will particularly be useful when studying the feasibility of the adaptive lightweight security solutions that will be part of the ASSET project.},

abstract = {Despite the availability of various methods and tools to facilitate secure coding, developers continue to write code that contains common vulnerabilities. It is important to understand why technological advances do not sufficiently facilitate developers in writing secure code. To widen our understanding of developers' behaviour, we considered the complexity of the security decision space of developers using theory from cognitive and social psychology. Our interdisciplinary study reported in this article (1) draws on the psychology literature to provide conceptual underpinnings for three categories of impediments to achieving security goals, (2) reports on an in-depth meta-analysis of existing software security literature that identified a catalogue of factors that influence developers' security decisions, and (3) characterises the landscape of existing security interventions that are available to the developer during coding and identifies gaps. Collectively, these show that different forms of impediments to achieving security goals arise from different contributing factors. Interventions will be more effective where they reflect psychological factors more sensitively and marry technical sophistication, psychological frameworks, and usability. Our analysis suggests “adaptive security interventions” as a solution that responds to the changing security needs of individual developers and a present a proof-of-concept tool to substantiate our suggestion.},

abstract = {In an adaptive security-critical system, security mechanisms change according to the type of threat posed by the environment. Specifying the behavior of these systems is difficult because conditions of the environment are difficult to describe until the system has been deployed and used for a length of time. This paper defines the problem of adaptation in security-critical systems, and outlines the RELAIS approach for expressing requirements and specifying the behavior in a way that helps identify the need for adaptation, and the appropriate adaptation behavior at runtime. The paper introduces the notion of adaptation via input approximation and proposes statistical machine learning techniques for realizing it. The approach is illustrated with a running example and is applied to a realistic security example from a cloud-based file-sharing application. Bayesian classification and logistic regression methods are used to implement adaptive specifications and these methods offer different levels of adaptive security and usability in the file-sharing application.},

abstract = {Despite the benefits offered by smart grids, energy producers, distributors and consumers are increasingly concerned about possible security and privacy threats. These threats typically manifest themselves at runtime as new usage scenarios arise and vulnerabilities are discovered. Adaptive security and privacy promise to address these threats by increasing awareness and automating prevention, detection and recovery from security and privacy requirements' failures at runtime by re-configuring system controls and perhaps even changing requirements. This paper discusses the need for adaptive security and privacy in smart grids by presenting some motivating scenarios. We then outline some research issues that arise in engineering adaptive security.

abstract = {Adaptive security aims to protect valuable assets managed by a system, by applying a varying set of security controls. Engineering adaptive security is not an easy task. A set of effective security countermeasures should be identified. These countermeasures should not only be applied to (primary) assets that customers desire to protect, but also to other (secondary) assets that can be exploited by attackers to harm the primary assets. Another challenge arises when assets vary dynamically at runtime. To accommodate these variabilities, it is necessary to monitor changes in assets, and apply the most appropriate countermeasures at runtime. The paper provides three main contributions for engineering adaptive security. First, it proposes a modeling notation to represent primary and secondary assets, along with their variability. Second, it describes how to use the extended models in engineering security requirements and designing required monitoring functions. Third, the paper illustrates our approach through a set of adaptive security scenarios in the customer domain of a smart grid. We suggest that modeling secondary assets aids the deployment of countermeasures, and, in combination with a representation of assets variability, facilitates the design of monitoring functions.},

Multi-modal biometrics is deployed to work with intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to overcome the shortcomings of uni-modal biometric systems. The cluster head is elected in which Dempster-Shafer theory is evaluated in order to increase the observation accuracy to maintain high security and trusted MANET. Since each device in the network has measurement and estimated limitations, more than one device needs to be chosen, and observations can be fused to increase observation accuracy using Dempster--Shafer theory for data fusion.},

The security solutions for such systems need to be adaptive for the continuous satisfaction of the software systems’ security goals. Whilst the existing research on self-adaptive security has made notable advancement towards designing and engineering self-adaptive security solutions, there exists little work on the taxonomic analysis of the architectures of the reported research and its applicability for open and ultra-large environments. We propose an architecture-centric taxonomy for mapping and comparing the current research and identifying the future research directions in this field. The proposed taxonomy has been used to review the representative work on the architectural characteristics that self-adaptive security systems must maintain for their effective application in large-scale open environments. We reflect on the findings from the taxonomic analysis and discuss the design principles, research challenges and limitations reported in the state of the art and practice.

abstract = {The emergence of powerful, sensor-rich devices has led to the development of continuous authentication (CA) schemes using off-the-shelf hardware, where user behaviour is compared to past experience to produce an authentication decision with the aim of addressing challenges with traditional authentication schemes. Current CA proposals, however, have largely neglected adversaries present in a real-world deployment, namely the ubiquity of mal ware and software attacks. This has particular importance when a device cannot be trusted by a third-party, such as a corporation, that controls access to assets based on that decision. A software compromise, either on the scheme implementation or platform, may enable an adversary to modify authentication scores to alter the status of the device in reality, give insights into user behaviour, or gain unauthorised access to restricted assets. Hence, for the first time, we examine two standardised constructs that offer isolated and trusted execution - Secure Elements (SEs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) - even when an adversary has root-level privileges, and propose measures for providing trusted CA while retaining deployability. Based on these, we implement the first system for evaluating TEE-based CA on a consumer mobile device using Intel SGX, thus providing confidentiality, integrity and trust while removing the main platform from the TCB. We present an empirical evaluation of TEE-and non-TEE performance using methods proposed in related CA schemes. Our results indicate that trusted CA can be provided with no significant performance penalty, and may even offer performance benefits.},

abstract = {The use of mobile agents to support the development of practical applications is limited primarily by the risks to which hosts in the system are subject to. This article introduces a distributed and adaptive security-monitoring framework to decrease such potential threats. The proposed framework is based on a modified version of the popular Boosting algorithm to classify malicious agents based on their execution patterns on current and prior hosts. Having implemented the framework for the Aglet platform, we herein present the results of our experiments showcasing the detection of agent entities in the system with intention deviating from that of their well-behaved counterparts.},

abstract = {Introducing security features in a system is not free and brings along its costs and impacts. Considering this fact is essential in the design of real-time embedded systems which have limited resources. To ensure correct design of these systems, it is important to also take into account impacts of security features on other non-functional requirements, such as performance and energy consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to perform trade-off analysis among non-functional requirements to establish balance among them. In this paper, we target the timing requirements of real-time embedded systems, and introduce an approach for choosing appropriate encryption algorithms at runtime, to achieve satisfaction of timing requirements in an adaptive way, by monitoring and keeping a log of their behaviors. The approach enables the system to adopt a less or more time consuming (but presumably stronger) encryption algorithm, based on the feedback on previous executions of encryption processes. This is particularly important for systems with high degree of complexity which are hard to analyze statistically.},

abstract = {Nowadays Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is one of the most widely used technologies to transmit the voice. With the widely spreading in such technology many counters attaches tried to apply different counter measure. In this paper we tried to build a counter countermeasure which increases the security of specific messages by performing a complicated three security stages. These stages are; embedding the selected voice into RGB image, hidden the image in voice signal and perform data integrity using real time protocol (RTP). Following such a proposed algorithm, the process of eavesdrop or counter attacks will not be able to break such a multi-layer security process. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive VoIP steganography approach to hide the audio information within images to enhance the security of the voice communications. The proposed system is completely implemented and developed using C++ in OPNET Modeler. Simulation results showed that the proposed system is robust enough to overcome many attacks such as denial of service, man-in-the-middle and eavesdrop without affecting network performance or quality of service.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) was initially proposed to connect specific things via the Internet using devices, such as RFID readers, to realise intelligent identification and management. This vision has since expanded to include a more diverse range of devices, services and networks to become an Internet of anything, anywhere, connected, anyhow. Security and privacy management for the IoT remains a core challenge.Many IoT devices maybe may have zero or minimal security by design because they are low resource, low power devices, designed to work as closed vertical services. Security threats and risks may be higher because devices are unattended, use local wireless communication that have no or weak encryption making them more susceptible to eavesdropping and because users find security too unusable to setup and operate and hence leave devices relatively unsecure. It may also be less problematic to reproduce and fake data sources, access nodes and data sinks that interact with IoT devices in order to attack devices or the services they access. Devices can be moved between or removed from private, communal, public and hostile physical spaces. There is a higher risk of a loss of privacy for human users and organisations because of an increased ability to eavesdrop, because of wireless networks with soft boundaries, and because embedded environment devices can sense smaller amounts of physical trails with a greater degree of sensitivity and accuracy. A specific focus is on the need for IoT security to adapt. The adaptation has multiple dimensions. We can adapt existing conventional security models to more effectively secure an IoT. We can adapt security pre-planned and unplanned context changes such as different moving around in different physical spaces. IoT systems can be designed to self-adapt. IoT systems need to adapt to the active (re) configuration and maintenance of IoT devices and systems of devices by users and by artificial agents.The proposed workshop intends to bring together researchers and practitioners from relevant fields to present and disseminate the latest on-going research focussing on adapting security, privacy &amp; management for the Internet of Things. It aims to facilitate knowledge transfer and synergy, bridge gaps between different research communities and groups, to lay down foundation for common purposes, and to help identify opportunities and challenges for interested researchers and technology and system developers.},

Many modern embedded systems have to fulfill strict security constraints and are often required to meet stringent deadlines in different operation modes, where the number and nature of active tasks vary (dynamic task sets). In this context, the use of dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS) techniques and onboard field-programmable gate array (FPGA) co-processors offer new dimensions for energy savings and performance enhancement. We propose a novel design framework that provides the best security protection consuming the minimal energy for all operation modes of a system.

abstract = {Our CPUs contain a compute instruction set, which regular applications use. But they also feature an intricate underworld of different CPU modes, combined with trap and exception handling to transition between these modes. These mechanisms are manifold and complex, yet the layering and functionality offered by the CPU modes is fixed. We have to take what CPU vendors provide, including potential security problems from unneeded modes. This paper explores the question, whether CPU modes could instead be defined entirely by software. We show how such a design would function and explore the advantages it enables. We believe that pushing all existing modes under a common design umbrella would enforce a cleaner structure and more control over exposed functionality. At the same time, the flexibility of software-defined modes enables interesting new use cases.},

They are growing in importance, as the stovepipe static methods of securing software systems have been shown to be inadequate for the challenges posed by modern software systems. Self-protection, like other self-* properties, allows the system to adapt to the changing environment through autonomic means without much human intervention, and can thereby be responsive, agile, and cost effective. While existing research has made significant progress towards autonomic and adaptive security, gaps and challenges remain. This article presents a significant extension of our preliminary study in this area. In particular, unlike our preliminary study, here we have followed a systematic literature review process, which has broadened the scope of our study and strengthened the validity of our conclusions. By proposing and applying a comprehensive taxonomy to classify and characterize the state-of-the-art research in this area, we have identified key patterns, trends and challenges in the existing approaches, which reveals a number of opportunities that will shape the focus of future research efforts.},

abstract = {Operating systems rely on system calls to allow the controlled communication of isolated processes with the kernel and other processes. Every system call includes a processor mode switch from the unprivileged user mode to the privileged kernel mode. Although processor mode switches are the essential isolation mechanism to guarantee the system's integrity, they induce direct and indirect performance costs as they invalidate parts of the processor state. In recent years, high-performance networks and storage hardware has made the user/kernel transition overhead the bottleneck for IO-heavy applications. To make matters worse, security vulnerabilities in modern processors (e.g., Meltdown) have prompted kernel mitigations that further increase the transition overhead. To decouple system calls from user/kernel transitions we propose AnyCall, which uses an in-kernel compiler to execute safety-checked user bytecode in kernel mode. This allows for very fast system calls interleaved with error checking and processing logic using only a single user/kernel transition. We have implemented AnyCall based on the Linux kernel's extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) subsystem. Our evaluation demonstrates that system call bursts are up to 55 times faster using AnyCall and that real-world applications can be sped up by 24 % even if only a minimal part of their code is run by AnyCall.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic and rapid paradigm shift in computing from static control systems (often implemented in hardware), to dynamic, easily-reconfigurable, software-defined systems. The researchers and practitioners have just begun to scratch the surface of how the ever-increasing software-defined everything (SD-X) changes the landscape of cybersecurity. On one hand, a software-defined world adds potentially new attack surfaces that deserve new research investigation. On the other hand, considering the fact that everything can be defined by the software, now we can have a new playground to redesign the security mechanisms and services. With programmable security, we can also better embrace the new advances in big data and AI to provide more intelligent and adaptive security for the software-defined world. We believe the opportunity is ripe for academics to make foundational contributions, collaboratively with industry, to shape the next 5 years of research in this new space, SPS (Software-defined Programmable Security). Emerging data centers, cloud networks, IoT and edge computing also provide a fertile playground to consider disruptive software-defined programmable security designs.}

abstract = {Remote exploitation attacks use software vulnerabilities to penetrate through a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This work addresses defending against remote exploitation attacks on vulnerable IoT devices. As an attack mitigation strategy, we assume it is not possible to fix all the vulnerabilities and propose to diversify the open-source software used to manage IoT devices. Our approach is to deploy dynamic cloud-based virtual machine proxies for physical IoT devices. Our architecture leverages virtual machine proxies with diverse software configurations to mitigate vulnerable and static software configurations on physical devices. We develop an algorithm for selecting new configurations based on network anomaly detection signals to learn vulnerable software configurations on IoT devices, automatically shifting towards more secure configurations. Cloud-based proxy machines mediate requests between application clients and vulnerable IoT devices, facilitating a dynamic diversification system. We report on simulation experiments to evaluate the dynamic system. Two models of powerful adversaries are introduced and simulated against the diversified defense strategy. Our experiments show that a dynamically diversified IoT architecture can be invulnerable to large classes of attacks that would succeed against a static architecture.},

abstract = {Evaluating the security of a computer network system is a challenging task. Configurations of large systems are complex entities in continuous evolution. The installation of new software, a change in the firewall rules, or the discovery of a software vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious user to gain unauthorized control of the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the assets of an organization.This paper presents a framework for building security assessment tools able to perform online verification of the security of a system configuration. Heterogeneous data generated from multiple sources are integrated into a homogeneous RDF representation using domain-specific ontologies and used for assessing the security of a configuration toward known attack vectors. Different vocabularies can be defined to express configurations, policies and attacks for each aspect of the security of an organization (e.g., network security, physical security and application level security) in a modular way. By automatically extracting part of the configuration from the network system, the tool is able to detect in near real-time security threats created by configuration changes.},

abstract = {"Having Divided to Conquer We Must Reunite [to] Rule" [3]. Decomposition of problems and systems into smaller, more manageable units has been at the heart of software engineering practice for decades. "Separation of concerns" gives software engineers the conceptual and practical tools to focus their attention, and their tools, on the parts of the problem or solution to which they are best suited. Perhaps one of the earliest boundaries used to separate concerns is that which exists between hardware and software - once that boundary is drawn, software engineers were able to focus their attention on the development of software within the hardware boundaries chosen. There has however, been a steady erosion of such boundaries: digital and physical connectivity have become the norm, and increasingly such connectivity can be ad hoc, spontaneous, and often unplanned (perhaps best exemplified by the Internet of Things paradigm). Moreover, the fluid and disappearing boundaries between technology and people have radically affected social behaviours (again, perhaps well exemplified by the proliferation of mobile and ubiquitous computing such as wearable and 'smart' technologies used in variety of personal and community settings). Such convergence between digital, physical, and social spaces has provided exciting opportunities for software engineers to, literally, 'cross boundaries', and, as a result, to have an impact on the physical and social worlds in which the software they build will operate. But in this brave new world with porous boundaries, security engineering and privacy management challenges abound. Effective security depends on the ability to control access to assets protected by boundaries [2]. Effective privacy management depends on informed, consensual sharing of information across boundaries [4]. Our thesis is that, although increasingly invisible, and rightly so, explicit awareness and sometimes representation of boundaries in cyber-physical-social systems facilitate good old fashioned separation of concerns, which in turn enables more effective software engineering of secure, privacy-aware software [5, 6]. We support our thesis with examples from our research in adaptive security [7] and privacy [1].},

In this paper, we present an operating system design that challenges a long-held tenet of multicore operating systems in order to produce an alternative architecture that has the potential to deliver both increased security and faster performance. In particular, we propose decoupling the operating system kernel from user processes by running each on completely separate processor cores instead of at different privilege levels within shared cores. Without using the hardware's privilege modes, virtualization and virtual memory contexts enforce the security policies necessary to maintain process isolation and protection. Our new kernel design paradigm offers the opportunity to simultaneously increase both performance and security; utilizing the hardware facilities for inter-core communication in place of those for privilege mode switching offers the opportunity for increased system call performance, while the hard separation between user processes and the kernel provides several strong security properties.},

abstract = {Threshold cryptography is a fundamental distributed computational paradigm for enhancing the availability and the security of cryptographic public-key schemes. It does it by dividing private keys into n shares handed out to distinct servers. In threshold signature schemes, a set of at least t+1 ≤ n servers is needed to produce a valid digital signature. Availability is assured by the fact that any subset of t+1 servers can produce a signature when authorized. At the same time, the scheme should remain robust (in the fault tolerance sense) and unforgeable (cryptographically) against up to t corrupted servers; i.e., it adds quorum control to traditional cryptographic services and introduces redundancy. Originally, most practical threshold signatures have a number of demerits: They have been analyzed in a static corruption model (where the set of corrupted servers is fixed at the very beginning of the attack), they require interaction, they assume a trusted dealer in the key generation phase (so that the system is not fully distributed), or they suffer from certain overheads in terms of storage (large share sizes). In this paper, we construct practical fully distributed (the private key is born distributed), non-interactive schemes --- where the servers can compute their partial signatures without communication with other servers--- with adaptive security (i.e., the adversary corrupts servers dynamically based on its full view of the history of the system). Our schemes are very efficient in terms of computation, communication, and scalable storage (with private key shares of size O(1), where certain solutions incur O(n) storage costs at each server). Unlike other adaptively secure schemes, our schemes are erasure-free (reliable erasure is a hard to assure and hard to administer property in actual systems).To the best of our knowledge, such a fully distributed highly constrained scheme has been an open problem in the area. In particular, and of special interest, is the fact that Pedersen's traditional distributed key generation (DKG) protocol can be safely employed in the initial key generation phase when the system is born -- although it is well-known not to ensure uniformly distributed public keys. An advantage of this is that this protocol only takes one round optimistically (in the absence of faulty player).},

We propose a two-level authentication system and use two PPG signals collected through face and finger of the subject for cross-correlation. PPG signals are generated due to involuntary body processes and therefore cannot be mimicked. Conventional face and finger print recognition is performed as the first-level security clearance. However, both these can be breached by wearing 3D printed finger tips or masking the face by undergoing surgery or 3D printed wearable face masks. Therefore, a second level security based on involuntary PPG signals is employed for enhanced security. This simultaneous measurement of these heart signals and their correlation is used as a biometric criterion for second level authentication and corresponding results are presented in this paper.},

abstract = {Security is concerned with the protection of assets from intentional harm. Secure systems provide capabilities that enable such protection to satisfy some security requirements. In a world increasingly populated with mobile and ubiquitous computing technology, the scope and boundary of security systems can be uncertain and can change. A single functional component, or even multiple components individually, are often insufficient to satisfy complex security requirements on their own. Adaptive security aims to enable systems to vary their protection in the face of changes in their operational environment. Collaborative security, which we propose in this paper, aims to exploit the selection and deployment of multiple, potentially heterogeneous, software-intensive components to collaborate in order to meet security requirements in the face of changes in the environment, changes in assets under protection and their values, and the discovery of new threats and vulnerabilities. However, the components that need to collaborate may not have been designed and implemented to interact with one another collaboratively. To address this, we propose a novel framework for collaborative security that combines adaptive security, collaborative adaptation and an explicit representation of the capabilities of the software components that may be needed in order to achieve collaborative security. We elaborate on each of these framework elements, focusing in particular on the challenges and opportunities afforded by (1) the ability to capture, represent, and reason about the capabilities of different software components and their operational context, and (2) the ability of components to be selected and mediated at runtime in order to satisfy the security requirements. We illustrate our vision through a collaborative robotic implementation, and suggest some areas for future work.},

Its most important feature is its highly efficient use of processor resources, accomplished by dynamically changing the number of processors within a security-domain (i.e., dynamically yielding processors to other security-domains) in response to application load requirements. Two new technologies make this scaling possible without any virtualization software: (1) self-transition management and (2) unified virtual address mapping. Evaluations show that this domain control provides highly scalable performance and incurs almost no performance overhead in security-domains. The increase in OSs in binary code size is less than 1.5%, and the time required for individual state transitions is on the order of a single millisecond. This scaling is the first in the world to make possible the dynamic changing of the number of processors within a security-domain on an ARM SMP.},

A major challenge in self-adaptive access control is ensuring that chosen adaptations are valid, and produce a satisfiable model of access. The contribution of this paper is the generation, transformation and verification of Role Based Access Control (RBAC) models at run-time, as a means for providing assurances that the adaptations to be deployed are valid. The goal is to protect the system against insider threats by adapting at run-time the access control policies associated with system resources, and access rights assigned to users. Depending on the type of attack, and based on the models from the target system and its environment, the adapted access control models need to be evaluated against the RBAC metamodel, and the adaptation constraints related to the application. The feasibility of the proposed approach has been demonstrated in the context of a fully working prototype using malicious scenarios inspired by a well documented case of insider attack.},

abstract = {An access control system is often viewed as a state transition system. Given a set of access control policies, a general safety requirement in such a system is to determine whether a desirable property is satisfied in all the reachable states. Such an analysis calls for formal verification. While formal analysis on traditional RBAC has been done to some extent, the extensions of RBAC lack such an analysis. In this paper, we propose a formal technique to perform security analysis on the Generalized Temporal RBAC (GTRBAC) model which can be used to express a wide range of temporal constraints on different RBAC components like role, user and permission. In the proposed approach, at first the GTRBAC system is mapped to a state transition system built using timed automata. Characteristics of each role, user and permission are captured with the help of timed automata. A single global clock is used to express the various temporal constraints supported in a GTRBAC model. Next, a set of safety and liveness properties is specified using computation tree logic (CTL). Model checking based formal verification is then done to verify the properties against the model to determine if the system is secure with respect to a given set of access control policies. Both time and space analysis has been done for studying the performance of the approach under different configurations.},

Security threats exploiting vulnerabilities in medical devices may directly impact patient safety. Standardization and federal organizations are hence, actively involved in setting up new paradigms for guidance and regulation of security throughout the lifecycle. To protect medical devices against threats a risk-based framework that continually manages and assesses security risks along with their proactive addressing is highly recommended. In this paper, we model a multi-modal design approach for risk assessment in medical devices and propose an adaptive remediation scheme to mitigate security threats. Our multi-modal approach is integrated into the hardware-software development with a middleware for interaction between the modes. This provides an effective premarket risk management while the adaptive remediation scheme pro-actively mitigate risk during postmarket deployment. We model our approaches in detail and demonstrate them in a pacemaker design model and deployment scenario.},

abstract = {Cybersecurity incidents are increasing, and at the same time, our society depends more and more on cyber-physical systems. Systematic approaches to measure cybersecurity are needed in order to support efficient construction and maintenance of secure software systems. Security measurement of software architectures is needed to produce sufficient evidence of security level as early as in the design phase. Design-time security measuring should support "security by design" approach. Moreover, software architectures have to support runtime security measurement to obtain up-to-date security information from an online software system, service or product. Security metrics and measurements are exploited in situational awareness monitoring and self-adaptive security solutions. The area of security metrics and security assurance metrics research is evolving, but still lacks widely accepted metrics definitions and applicable measuring techniques. Strong collaboration between security experts, software architects and system developers is needed to address this. MeSSa2017 workshop addresses these and other related topics to increase the importance of the overall picture, requiring sets of design patterns, measurements, metrics, best practices, and means to integrate this cost-effectively in the overall design and operational profiles.The outcome of the workshop will be an increased shared understanding of challenges and opportunities in systematic approaches to measure cybersecurity, which are needed in order to support efficient construction and maintenance of secure software systems.},
