It also goes without saying that this approach to computing shares its own challenges the most echoed being security. Security concerns herein, birthed by the exposure of the cloud to different threats, continue to cast doubts on potential users and it's only befitting that such concerns are addressed. Users who entrust their data to the cloud want their data to be secured in the strongest terms possible. Once data leaves the user, the onus is on the cloud provider to provide the required security since data now lies within their perimeter of jurisdiction. But security requirements do change with time and this therefore calls for a continuous process of evaluating the security status of the cloud system. This paper proposes a model of analyzing the security status of the cloud system with regards confidentiality, integrity and availability. We employ state transitions of a conceptual finite state machine, Boolean algebra and logic to evaluate the various states of the system when a specified breach occurs. The scope of this paper is limited to user data on the cloud and not as it traverses the network between the user and the provider.","","978-1-4673-8515-2","10.1109/CCI.2016.7778962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778962","cloud computing;threats;state transitions;Boolean logic","Cloud computing;Security;Computational modeling;Analytical models;NIST;Software as a service","Boolean algebra;cloud computing;finite state machines;security of data","integrated state transition-Boolean logic model;security analysis;cloud computing;security requirements;security status evaluation;cloud system;confidentiality;integrity;availability;conceptual finite state machine;Boolean algebra","","","","20","IEEE","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The recent articles indicate that Ormon PLCs used Fins Ethernet protocol were exposed to mode-switching malicious network attack. However, the traditional detection methods based on function codes and Snort detection rules could not get an ideal result. In this paper, we propose a method that can overcome these problems in dealing with mode-switching attack by an external hash authentication device embedding asymmetric encryption.

The first objective is to minimize the real power loss and the Total Voltage Deviations (TVDs), and the second objective is to minimize incremental system loss. Then a Filter Collaborative State Transition Algorithm (FCSTA) is presented for solving DRPO problems. Two populations corresponding to two different objectives are employed. Moreover, the filter technique is utilized to deal with constraints.

State transition diagrams, the graphical representation of penetrations, identify precisely the requirements for and the compromise of a penetration and present only the critical events that must occur for the successful completion of the penetration. State transition diagrams are written to correspond to the states of an actual computer system, and these diagrams form the basis of a rule based expert system for detecting penetrations, called the state transition analysis tool (STAT). The design and implementation of a Unix specific prototype of this expert system, called USTAT, is also presented. This prototype provides a further illustration of the overall design and functionality of this intrusion detection approach.

To handle more complex state transformations, the framework includes a number of extension mechanisms designed to minimize the overall programming effort. Our experience with real-world programs suggests that our framework can handle all the standard C idioms and support safe and automated state transfer for complex state changes.

For each Unix process, the user credentials, which are user identifiers, determine the process privilege, including whether a process has gained a high privilege, such as that of the superuser. The state transition technique is applied to a suitably defined process state, identified by certain classes of user credential values. A transition takes place when these values change from one class to another. These states are clearly defined, and prohibited state transitions as well as some supporting rules are identified. When many break-ins succeed, either the rules are violated or these prohibited transitions occur, and this implies a violation of system security policy. A specially modified system call, ktrace0, is used by the superuser to monitor the process-state and state transition analysis is applied to the traced information, by the Intrusion Detection System. Tests show that most known security violations belonging to the targeted classes (such as buffer overflow exploits) can be detected (and possibly pre-empted) while the constituent activities are still being processed in the kernel.","1063-9527","0-7695-0346-2","10.1109/CSAC.1999.816050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=816050","","Intrusion detection","security of data;Unix","process state transition analysis;security breach detection;computer system;Unix process;user credential;user identifiers;process privilege;superuser;prohibited state transitions;break-ins;system call;ktrace;process state monitoring;traced information;Intrusion Detection System","","3","","21","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fins protocol as one of the most popular protocols is built into a larger number of Ormon devices that are used in different kinds of measurement, and control systems and has been targeted as the desirable candidate for cyber-attack. However, the traditional detection method based on traffic analysis and function code compliance detection is unable to detect mode-switching attack that is consistent with the protocol syntax, and it is a very harmful network attack against industrial devices. In this paper, we analyze the defects of measurement and control system using Fins protocol, launch mode-switching attack against Ormon PLC devices and display how to defend against this attack by designing a detection rules insert into Snort.

This paper proposes a semantic based intrusion detection scheme where state transition analysis, pattern matching and data mining techniques are integrated to maximize the detection accuracy. Patterns and rules are formulated based on the events detected by WSN. The sink receives information about the several events happening in the coverage area and correlates the streaming data (events) in spatial domain (several sensors) and time domain. The semantic rules are developed using ANTLR tool. The proposed scheme has been validated using a surveillance system for detecting an intruder. Implementations prove that the proposed hybrid intrusion detection scheme can accurately detect an intruder with the help of a wired network and an appropriate database.","","978-1-4577-0590-8","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972244","Wireless Sensor Network (WSN);Intrusion Detection System (IDS);ANTLR","Radiofrequency identification;Pattern matching;Intrusion detection;Image sensors;Grammar;Semantics","computer network security;data mining;pattern matching;wireless sensor networks","state transition analysis;pattern matching;metamorphosed;semantic based intrusion detection scheme;data mining technique;WSN;data streaming;spatial domain;time domain;semantic rules;ANTLR tool;surveillance system;hybrid intrusion detection scheme","","6","","19","IEEE","4 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional RA model ignores the non-dispatchable start-up and shut-down processes of combustion turbines and steam turbines (i.e. transition trajectories) in CCGTs and is less considered about the effect from natural gas system.

Specifically, basic information is obtained from network traffic. In our framework, the first-level detection uses convolutional neural network (CNN) to feature extraction and anomaly identification. In the second-level detection, we propose a process state transfer algorithm. The feature extracted by the CNN model is invoked as the input of the algorithm to construct the normal state process transfer model of ICS. The model detects whether the current data meets the normal state transition process of the system, and may find unknown attacks or 0-day attacks. Finally, through laboratory gas pipeline network system verification, we found that the anomaly detection framework combined with the two methods has more outstanding performance than several current latest technologies.","2374-9628","978-1-5386-6808-5","10.1109/PCCC.2018.8710993","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8710993","Industrial Control System;anomaly detection;convolutional neural network;process state transfer algorithm","Integrated circuits;Feature extraction;Anomaly detection;Intrusion detection;Convolution","control engineering computing;convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;industrial control;pipelines;production engineering computing;security of data;telecommunication traffic","convolutional neural network;feature extraction;anomaly identification;process state transfer algorithm;CNN model;normal state process transfer model;normal state transition process;laboratory gas pipeline network system verification;ICS data;industrial control equipment;ICS business logic stability;network traffic;industrial control systems;intrusion detection;two-level anomaly detection","","11","","28","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, a bit based pattern matching algorithm with FSM state transition controller for both parallel processing and assertion based input payload validity check is proposed. Here during the matching process, the Finite State Machine (FSM) state controller will be used in case of early misdetection to optimize overall matching time in case of a longer pattern where the rule is being divided into sub patterns and the successive matches are halted which is done parallel with sub patterns. To avoid synchronization problem over parallel matching process unique controllers are used which is driven with fully integrated page enabled sub groups. The efficiency of FSM state controlled pattern matching process is proved over speed and power metrics.

In this paper, we classify common consensus algorithms based on how they decide the order of system state changes. We then determine the extent to which each category prioritizes scalability, decentralization, and security. As with other engineering design scenarios, this is a choose-two tradeoff. Our key contribution is that, based on this taxonomy of tradeoffs, we are able to discern the types of consensus algorithms that work well within the application area(s) for a given distributed system. We find that a dichotomy of algorithms between leader-based and voting-based consensus algorithms emerges from this taxonomy.

This paper presents a state transition model to describe the dynamic behavior of intrusion-tolerant systems. This model provides a framework from which we can define the vulnerability and the threat set to be addressed. We also show how this model helps us to describe both known and unknown security exploits by focusing on impacts rather than specific attack procedures.

To fully utilize the spatial degrees-of-freedom of multiple antennas, the function of antennas at the destination is not predefined, i.e., each antenna can operate in a transmit or receive mode. We propose a low-complexity near-optimal joint optimization scheme by jointly applying the dynamic antenna mode switching (AMS) and optimal power allocation (OPA) techniques, to maximize the secrecy rate of the FD destination-based jamming (DBJ) system. The proposed joint optimization scheme is valid for two different eavesdropping channel state information (ECSI) availability cases, i.e., instantaneous ECSIs and statistical ECSIs. Specifically, closed-form expressions of OPA factors are first derived, and then the optimal transmit and receive antennas sets at the destination are determined by combining the OPA factor and applying a greedy-search-based AMS approach for both ECSIs availabilities, respectively. Moreover, through complexity analysis, the search complexity of the proposed scheme is proven to be significantly reduced compared with the exhaustive searching method.

Embedded NVM provides better security, SOC specific customization, and better integration to other SOC components. It also interacts with many critical modules, like Power Management Controller (PMC), Reset-sequencing State control machine, etc.; while also playing a very important role in power-up sequencing and mode transitions of the chip, since it contains the analog trimming, firmware and final customer application code. The NVM is a big complex component containing Digital and Analog sections, along with Bitcell Arrays and multiplexers. Once integrated in a SOC, it is quite important to check proper functioning of SOC and NVM across power-up and low-power-mode transitions. At present, NVM verification at IP level is done in parts, with individual sub-modules tested separately and limited verification of complete NVM IP after its sub-modules modules are stitched together. At SOC level, verification is done using behavioral model of NVM, which again loses electrical aspect of the signals. Thus mixed-mode simulations at SOC-level are needed for NVM. But, taking the entire NVM-Array in SPICE is an un-necessary load of millions of MOSFETs on the simulator, and beyond the capacity of many tools. The repeated memory-bank-structures do contain a lot of analog circuitry, and optimized techniques can allow for a simulation friendly design-size. We have developed method to model the NVM which allow us to run Chip-level simulations with a SPICE & Verilog-A/AMS views of the NVM.

However, in the LR framework, constructing feasible solutions and updating Lagrangian multipliers are two major challenges, and the efficiency of MILP methods is restricted by the scale of UC problems. To this end, this paper proposes a new fast solution method for large-scale UC based on virtual power boundary. Specifically, first, an initial trial solution is obtained based on the established state transition diagram. Second, a feasibility test model based on virtual power boundary is established to check the feasibility of trial UC solutions effectively. Third, the updating strategies for UC solutions are proposed based on the feasible gap solved by the feasibility test model. The procedure is implemented until a good feasible UC solution is obtained.

During the tip selection process in the unsteady regime, the state transition probability refers to the probability of a transaction changing from the initial state to an arbitrary state. The state transition probability plays an indispensable role in the performance and security analysis of the IoT relying on DAG-based ledgers. In this paper, we derive the exact expression and an approximate expression of the state transition probability, which both are in closed form. In addition, we propose and analyze three performance metrics, i.e., the expected cumulative weight, the expected number of steps, and the confirmation failure probability, which are derived from the state transition probability and greatly enrich the performance analysis and evaluation of the IoT.

Despite of the convenience in collecting information to provide the decision basis for the users, the vulnerability of embedded sensor nodes in multimedia devices makes the malware propagation a growing serious problem, which would harm the security of devices and their users financially and physically in wireless multimedia system (WMS). Therefore, many researches related to the malware propagation and suppression have been proposed to protect the topology and system security of wireless multimedia network. In these studies, the epidemic model is of great significance to the analysis of malware propagation. Considering the cloud and state transition of sensor nodes, a cloud-assisted model for malware detection and the dynamic differential game against malware propagation are proposed in this paper. Firstly, a SVM based malware detection model is constructed with the data sharing at the security platform in the cloud. Then the number of malware-infected nodes with physical infectivity to susceptible nodes is calculated precisely based on the attributes of WMS transmission. Then the state transition among WMS devices is defined by the modified epidemic model. Furthermore, a dynamic differential game and target cost function are successively derived for the Nash equilibrium between malware and WMS system. On this basis, a saddle-point malware detection and suppression algorithm is presented depending on the modified epidemic model and the computation of optimal strategies. Numerical results and comparisons show that the proposed algorithm can increase the utility of WMS efficiently and effectively.","1673-5447","","10.1109/CC.2018.8300282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8300282","Internet of Things;wireless multimedia system;state transition;malware propagation;differential game","Malware;Cloud computing;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Communication system security;Multimedia communication","cloud computing;computer network security;game theory;Internet of Things;invasive software;multimedia communication;radiocommunication;topology","Internet of Things;malware suppression framework;cloud-assisted malware detection;saddle-point malware detection;modified epidemic model;WMS devices;malware-infected nodes;SVM based malware detection;state transition;wireless multimedia network;system security;topology;malware propagation;multimedia devices;embedded sensor nodes;dynamic network service infrastructure;dynamic differential game;IoT;wireless multimedia system","","19","","","","21 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The salient features of VANET, such as highly dynamic connections, sensitive information sharing, and unreliable fading channels, make the security quantification challenging. Accurate measurement for VANET security depends on the sufficient understanding of “context”, or making sense of the states, environment, or situation. This article proposes a context-aware security quantification scheme for VANET based on the Markov chain. Firstly, a Homogeneous Continuous-Time Markov Chain (HCTMC)-based security state model is designed for VANET. The value of each state of the HCTMC is determined with a value function that incorporates the security strength of transmitted data, dynamic and randomness of the vehicular channel, and transmission delay of the current situated environment of VANETs. Finally, the state transition matrix is derived based on the Homogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain (HDTMC) and Homogeneous Poisson Process (HPP). Simulation results show that the security quantification method enables the VANET's system to adopt context-aware defense strategies according to the situated environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3017557","National Nature Science Foundation(grant numbers:61572229,6171101066,61872158,61806083); Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Development Foundation(grant numbers:20170204074GX,20180201068GX,20190103051JH); Jilin Provincial International Cooperation Foundation(grant numbers:20180414015GH); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9170576","Security quantification;VANET;Markov chain;state transition","Security;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Markov processes;Delays;Adaptation models;Vehicle dynamics","Markov processes;probability;stochastic processes;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","context-aware defense strategies;context-aware quantification;VANET security;Markov Chain-based scheme;context-aware security quantification scheme;homogeneous continuous-time Markov chain;security strength;Homogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain;security quantification method;VANET system;security state model;fading channels;sensitive information sharing;HCTMC;HDTMC;state transition matrix;vehicular channel;transmission delay;homogeneous Poisson process;HPP","","11","","27","CCBY","18 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this regard, a converter-based battery dynamic model is presented which includes current- bidirectional DC-DC converter, thereby being able to observe its fast mode change as a response to severe frequency excursions. Also, an active power-frequency characteristic is proposed which considers the impact of battery pre-contingency operating point on its available headroom for primary frequency response provision.

In this work, we propose a novel application of a key-based obfuscation technique to achieve security against hardware Trojans. The obfuscation scheme is based on modifying the state transition function of a given circuit by expanding its reachable state space and enabling it to operate in two distinct modes - the normal mode and the obfuscated mode. Such a modification obfuscates the rareness of the internal circuit nodes, thus making it difficult for an adversary to insert hard-to-detect Trojans. It also makes some inserted Trojans benign by making them activate only in the obfuscated mode. The combined effect leads to higher Trojan detectability and higher level of protection against such attack. Simulation results for a set of benchmark circuits show that the scheme is capable of achieving high levels of security at modest design overhead.","1558-2434","978-1-60558-800-1","10.1145/1687399.1687424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361306","Design obfuscation;hardware security;hardware Trojan","Hardware;Information security;Protection;National security;State-space methods;Circuit simulation;Circuit testing;Permission;Computational modeling;Logic design","circuit CAD;integrated circuit design;invasive software;monolithic integrated circuits;national security;safety-critical software","security;malicious hardware Trojan;design obfuscation;safety-critical applications;state transition function;reachable state space;internal circuit nodes","","68","2","9","","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most often the reengineering process ignores to take into account specific non-functional requirements, such as maintainability, for the target system. In this paper, we propose a quality driven software migration framework that aims to identify and extract an object model from a procedural system and to generate quality migrant object oriented code which satisfies non-functional requirements. Such a reengineering framework is composed of quality models to denote desired quality characteristics for the target migrant systems, transformation rules and, an incremental and iterative quality-driven transformation process that is based on a state transition system. The process aims to identify a sequence of software transformations that generate a target system with desired quality characteristics. Moreover, an evaluation technique is presented to verify and validate the achievement of quality requirements in the obtained migrated system.

A dynamic HMM model and a set of expected risk scenarios of CPPS are established based on the observable results of physical system faults by the information system. Furthermore, the corresponding multi-index risk assessment model of CPPS is established to describe the risk propagation ability of the system in its operation state, followed by the migration of the operation mode according to the adjustment of the high-risk event-driven control strategy.

Software that heavily interacts with the underlying OS (e.g., I/O intensive and event-driven applications) suffers from system call overhead. To deteriorate this situation, security vulnerabilities in modern processors have prompted kernel mitigations that further increase the transition overhead. Particularly system-call-heavy applications have been reported to be slowed down by up to 30% with kernel page-table isolation (KPTI), the widely deployed mitigation for the Meltdown vulnerability. To decouple system calls from mode transitions, we revisit an old idea known as system-call batching or multi-calls: the bundling of system calls into a combined call, which only incurs the mode-transition costs of a single one. And then, we have implemented ESCA scheme to adapt system-call batching to Linux-based servers in the light of Meltdown and Spectre, effectively eliminating the slowdown of KPTI-affected applications. Our evaluation shows that the throughputs of real-world applications, benefiting from ESCA, can be improved with only 2 lines of code changed respectively: Nginx by up to 12%, lighttpd by up to 23%, and Redis by 4%.

The focus of this paper is the design of a DOK security service that provides for enforcing both local security policies, related to the security of local autonomous databases, and federated security policies, governing access to data aggregates composed of data from multiple distributed databases. We propose Global Access Control, an extended access control mechanism enabling a uniform expression of heterogeneous security information. Mappings from existing Mandatory and Discretionary Access Controls are described. To permit the control of data aggregation, the derivation of unauthorized information from authorized data, our security framework provides a logic-based language, the Federated Logic Language (FELL), which can describe constraints on both single and multiple states of the federation. To enforce constraints, FELL statements are mapped to state transition graphs which model the different subcomputations required to check the aggregation constraints. Graph aggregation operations are proposed for building compound state transition graphs for complex constraints. To monitor aggregation constraints, two marking techniques, called Linear Marking Technique and Zigzag Marking Technique, are proposed.

The quickest detection algorithm aims at minimizing the worst case detection delays (WDDs) of cyberattacks, subject to an upper bound of the false alarm rate. Since power-grid state transitions could be caused by either cyberattacks or sudden change in loads or grid configurations, we propose to distinguish between an FDIA and a sudden system change by using a time-varying dynamic model, which can accurately capture the dynamic state transitions due to changes in system configurations. A dynamic state estimation algorithm is developed to estimate and track the time-varying and nonstationary power-grid states. The quickest detection algorithm is developed by analyzing the statistical properties of dynamic state estimations, such that the algorithm minimizes the WDD while accurately distinguishing FDIA from sudden system changes. A Markov-chain-based analytical model is used to identify the detector’s parameter and quantify its performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can accurately detect and remove false data injections or system faults with minimum delays. The proposed algorithm can be implemented to harden intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) or supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to improve their resilience to cyberattacks or system faults, thus improving the cybersecurity of smart grids.","2168-6785","","10.1109/JESTPE.2019.2936587","U.S. Department of Energy(grant numbers:DE-OE0000779); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1711087); U.S. Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative AFOSR(grant numbers:MURI 18RT0073); NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1717454,CNS-1731424,CNS-1702850,CNS-1646607); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8808884","Cyberattack;dynamic load change;dynamic state estimation;false data injection;power system","Power system dynamics;Heuristic algorithms;Delays;State estimation;Smart grids;Detection algorithms","delays;distributed sensors;Markov processes;open loop systems;power system security;power system state estimation;SCADA systems;security of data;smart power grids","false data injection attacks;smart grid;quickest intrusion detection algorithm;FDIA;time-varying dynamic model;worst case detection delays;cyberattacks;false alarm rate;power-grid state transitions;grid configurations;dynamic state transitions;system configurations;dynamic state estimation algorithm;nonstationary power-grid states;dynamic state estimations;Markov-chain-based analytical model;false data injections;system faults;supervisory control","","9","","38","IEEE","21 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Stateful network protocols have complex communication interactions and state transitions. However, the existing network protocol fuzzing does not support state transitions very well. This paper focuses on this issue and proposes the Semi-valid Fuzzing for the Stateful Network Protocol (SFSNP). The SFSNP analyzes protocol interactions and builds an extended finite state machine with a path marker for the network protocol; then it obtains test sequences of the extended finite state machine, and further performs the mutation operation using the semi-valid algorithm for each state transition in the test sequences; finally, it obtains fuzzing sequences. Moreover, because different test sequences may have the same state transitions, the SFSNP uses the state transition marking algorithm to reduce redundant test cases. By using the stateful rule tree of the protocol, the SFSNP extracts the constraints in the protocol specifications to construct semi-valid fuzz testing cases within the sub-protocol domain, and finally forms fuzzing sequences. Experimental results indicate that the SFSNP is reasonably effective at reducing the quantity of generated test cases and improving the quality of fuzz testing cases. The SFSNP can reduce redundancy and shorten testing time.","1007-0214","","10.23919/TST.2017.8030535","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8030535","network protocol fuzzing; extended finite state machine; test sequence; state transition markingalgorithm; semi-valid algorithm","Testing;Security;Software;Trajectory;Transport protocols;Redundancy","computer network security;finite state machines;fuzzy set theory;program testing;transport protocols","SFSNP analyzes protocol interactions;extended finite state machine;test sequences;semivalid algorithm;state transition;stateful rule tree;protocol specifications;semivalid fuzz testing cases;Stateful Network Protocol;Semivalid Fuzzing;subprotocol domain;network protocol fuzzing","","2","","","","11 Sep 2017","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

State transition analysis is a new approach to representing computer penetrations. In STAT, a penetration is identified as a sequence of state changes that take the computer system from some initial state to a target compromised state. The development of the first USTAT prototype, which is for SunOS 4.1.1, is discussed. USTAT makes use of the audit trails that are collected by the C2 basic security module of SunOS, and it keeps track of only those critical actions that must occur for the successful completion of the penetration. This approach differs from other rule-based penetration identification tools that pattern match sequences of audit records.<>","","0-8186-3370-0","10.1109/RISP.1993.287646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=287646","","Real time systems;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Data analysis;Expert systems;Software tools;Computer science;Prototypes;Target tracking;Data security","auditing;real-time systems;security of data;Unix;utility programs","USTAT;real-time intrusion detection system;UNIX;STAT;state transition analysis tool;computer penetrations;SunOS 4.1.1;audit trails;C2 basic security module;critical actions;rule-based penetration identification tools;pattern match sequences;audit records","","79","15","10","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An anti-attack switched event-triggered mechanism (ATASETM) is designed by considering the impact of ADoS attacks on the systems. Based on the mechanism, the entire time interval is split into rest intervals, continuous detection intervals, residual intervals, and ADoS active-attack intervals. The closed-loop system (CLS) is represented as a three-mode switched system by merging these intervals. Subsequently, a three-piecewise Lyapunov function is constructed for fewer conservative criteria to ensure that the CLS is $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ exponentially stable. An exact expression of the relationship between the decay rate and length of the dormant- and active-attack intervals is obtained. On the basis of the proposed criteria, a joint-design strategy is developed in terms of linear matrix inequalities for the desired trigger matrix and feedback gain. Lastly, a satellite control system and an inverted pendulum model are used to validate the ATASETM-based stability analysis and $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$ security control approaches. Numerical results demonstrate that the maximum allowable exponential decay rate decreases with increasing attack time (and vice versa), and the optimal $\mathcal {H}_\infty$ performance level becomes worse as the attack time or the difficulty of the event triggering increases.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2023.3243095","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61503002); Anhui Provincial Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:202004a07020028); National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Science and ICT, South Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2020R1A2C1005449); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10039713","Denial-of-service attacks;event-triggered control;  $\mathcal {H}_{\infty }$   control;networked control systems;piecewise Lyapunov function","Control systems;Security;Switches;Denial-of-service attack;Lyapunov methods;Control theory;Symmetric matrices","asymptotic stability;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;feedback;H∞ control;linear matrix inequalities;Lyapunov methods;networked control systems;pendulums;switching systems (control)","ADoS active-attack intervals;anti-attack switched event-triggered mechanism;aperiodic DoS attacks;ATASETM-based stability analysis;closed-loop system;CLS;continuous detection intervals;denial-of-service attacks;dormant- attack intervals;feedback gain;H∞exponential stability;joint-design strategy;linear matrix inequalities;maximum allowable exponential decay rate;residual intervals;satellite control system;switched event-triggered H∞ security control approaches;three-mode switched system;three-piecewise Lyapunov function","","6","","59","IEEE","7 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, the use of reasonable spare inventory strategy, as well as maintenance and support decisions to systems is essential to improve system availability, security and system cost reducing. Maintenance strategy can be formulated based on the situation in which the products are monitored. For a single-component system, current research around its multi-state transferring have been quite mature, in which the conversion rate defined in a different state in Markov process can be clearly showed by conversion relationship between different state. However, the state transition process involved mostly considers the processes of repairing only, and rarely considers the impact to system availability by the transition of failure rate caused by changes in components, spare replacement strategies and spare supply. To solve this problem, this paper considered a single-component system with two derating states, and discussed its steady-state availability through variable spare replacement probability and different spare fill rate levels. With model of the system with two derating states established, generalized Markov method was used to solve the relationships between replacement timing and system availability with the level of spare fill rate considered. Finally, through the analysis of results, the preliminary conclusions were obtained. The results could clearly reveal the impacts of spare replacement strategy and spare fill rate in single-component system.","2166-5656","978-1-4799-7958-5","10.1109/PHM.2014.6988248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6988248","single-component;multi-states;replacment stategy;degradation system;system availability","Availability;Maintenance engineering;Steady-state;Markov processes;Equations;Mathematical model;Reliability engineering","cost reduction;inventory management;maintenance engineering;Markov processes","optimal replacement strategy;degradation system component;system availability;support process;equipment system;spare inventory strategy;turnaround time;product maintenance strategy;system support time;support decision;security;system cost reduction;single-component system;multistate transferring;Markov process;conversion relationship;state transition process;failure rate;spare replacement strategy;spare supply;steady-state availability;spare replacement probability;spare fill rate level;derating states;generalized Markov method;replacement timing","","","","8","IEEE","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies have revealed that control programs running on CPS devices suffer from both control-oriented attacks (e.g., code-injection or code-reuse attacks) and data-oriented attacks (e.g., non-control data attacks). Unfortunately, existing detection mechanisms are insufficient to detect runtime data-oriented exploits, due to the lack of runtime execution semantics checking. In this work, we propose Orpheus, a new security methodology for defending against data-oriented attacks by enforcing cyber-physical execution semantics. We first present a general method for reasoning cyber-physical execution semantics of a control program (i.e., causal dependencies between the physical context/event and program control flows), including the event identification and dependence analysis. As an instantiation of Orpheus, we then present a new program behavior model, i.e., the event-aware finite-state automaton (eFSA). eFSA takes advantage of the event-driven nature of CPS control programs and incorporates event checking in anomaly detection. It detects data-oriented exploits if a specific physical event is missing along with the corresponding event dependent state transition. We evaluate our prototype's performance by conducting case studies under data-oriented attacks. Results show that eFSA can successfully detect different runtime attacks. Our prototype on Raspberry Pi incurs a low overhead, taking 0.0001s for each state transition integrity checking, and 0.063s~0.211s for the cyber-physical contextual consistency checking.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2019.2906161","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:ONR-N00014-17-1-2498); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:OAC-1541105); Security and Software Engineering Research Center; National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8669815","Cyber-physical systems;data-oriented attacks;program anomaly detection;cyber-physical execution semantics","Runtime;Semantics;Anomaly detection;Sensors;Hidden Markov models;Security;Process control","cyber-physical systems;data integrity;finite state machines;program control structures;reasoning about programs;security of data","cyber-physical system security;malicious attacks;control-oriented attacks;code-reuse attacks;data-oriented attacks;noncontrol data attacks;runtime execution semantics checking;program control;event identification;dependence analysis;program behavior model;event-aware finite-state automaton;CPS control programs;event checking;physical event;runtime attacks;cyber-physical contextual consistency checking;event dependent state transition;cyber-physical execution semantics reasoning;runtime data-oriented exploit detection;event-aware program anomaly detection;code-injection attacks;Orpheus;causal dependencies;Raspberry Pi;state transition integrity checking","","17","","79","IEEE","19 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The numerical comparisons show that the differences between the results calculated using the generalized n+2 state system model and three state component model are significant in some cases, particularly for high level outages, The generalized n+2 state system model is a more accurate model compared to the conventional three state model.

The importance of semantics is widely recognized, as well. Indeed, there exists several solutions to the problem of providing semantics to web services, most of them relies on some form of Description Logic. This paper presents an integration of model checking and semantic reasoning technologies in an efficient way. This can be considered the first step towards the usage of semantic model checking in problems of security verification. The approach relies on a representation of services at the process level that is based on semantically annotated state transition systems (ASTS) and a representation of specifications that is based on a semantically annotated version of the computation tree logic (AnCTL). The proposed approach permit to perform an efficient and yet useful, semantic reasoning at process-level about web services.

We study the coupled system created by coupling the UIUC 150 Bus System with synthesized scale-free cyber network. Simulation results present that the dynamic profile of the cascading failures in a coupled system displays a “staircase-like” pattern which can be interpreted as a combined feature of the typical step propagation profile triggered repeatedly by cyber attacks due to cyber network coupling.

In simple terms, DT is described as a virtual replica of a given physical product, system, or process. It consists of three major segments: the physical entity, its virtual counterpart, and the connections between them. While the data is collected from a physical entity, processed at the virtual layer, and accessed in the form of a DT at the application layer, it is exposed to several security risks. To ensure the applicability of a DT system, it is imperative to understand these security risks and their implications. However, there is a lack of a framework that can be used to assess the security of a DT. This paper presents a framework in which the security of a DT can be analyzed with the help of a formal verification technique. The framework captures the defense of the system at different layers and considers various attacks at each layer. The security of the DT system is represented as a state-transition system and the security properties are captured in temporal logic. Probabilistic model checking (PMC) is used to verify the systems against these properties. In particular, the framework is used to analyze the probability of success and the cost of various potential attacks that can occur at each layer in a DT system. The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated with the help of a detailed case study in the healthcare domain.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3257171","Computer Science and Engineering Department and the Open Access Program from the American University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10068532","Digital twin security;security analysis;probabilistic model checking;Markov decision process;discrete time Markov chain","Security;Medical services;Sensors;Probabilistic logic;Model checking;Digital twins;Real-time systems","cyber-physical systems;digital twins;formal verification;health care;probability;production engineering computing;temporal logic","application layer;digital twin framework;Digital Twins;DT system;given physical product;physical entity;probabilistic model;security analysis;security properties;security risks;smart energy;smart healthcare;smart manufacturing;smart mobility;state-transition system;virtual counterpart;virtual layer;virtual replica","","","","85","CCBYNCND","14 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multipath execution is designed and implemented to achieve not only randomness of memory layout and diversity of binary files, but also randomness of program code paths executed, which is unique in our work.

The security of ICS has drawn the attention of many researchers since successful cyber-attacks against ICS can cause extensive damage in the physical world. Most of the existing literature describes solutions to protect an ICS against attacks directly targeting its underlying IT infrastructure. However, there are comparatively less works that focus on detecting cyber attacks against the physical process itself. Detection mechanisms that do so are said to be process aware. In this paper, we propose a time-based process aware intrusion detection system (IDS) that detects attacks against a physical process by leveraging its regular nature and temporal properties.

However, the growing interaction between the modern ICS and the Internet has made ICS more vulnerable to cyber attacks. In order to protect ICS from malicious attacks, intrusion detection technology emerges. By analyzing the network meta data or the industrial process data, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can identify attacks that violate communication protocols or system specifications. However, the existing intrusion detection technology is not omnipotent, which opens up a back door for some more advanced attacks. In this work, we design an enhanced multi-stage semantic attack against ICS, which is undetectable by existing IDS. By hijacking the communication channels between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the remote Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), the attacker can manipulate the measurement data and control instructions simultaneously. The fake measurement data deceives the human operator into making wrong decisions. Furthermore, the attacker can strategically manipulate the semantic meaning of control instructions according to system state transition rules. In the meanwhile, a fake view of measurement data is presented to the HMI to conceal the on-going malicious attack. This attack is totally stealthy since the message sizes and timing, the command sequences, and the system state values are all legitimate. Consequently, this attack can secretly bring the system into critical states. Experimental results have verified the strong attack ability of the proposed attack.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2949645","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802016,61702506); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0802805); National Social Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:17ZDA331); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2018M641198); Northwestern Polytechnical University(grant numbers:FRF-BD-18-016A); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8883158","Industrial control systems;multi-stage semantic attacks;state transition;stealthy attacks","Integrated circuits;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Semantics;Industrial control","computer network security;control engineering computing;critical infrastructures;industrial control;Internet;production engineering computing;programmable controllers","enhanced multistage semantic attack;industrial control systems;modern ICS;malicious attack;network meta data;industrial process data;Intrusion Detection Systems;advanced attacks;control instructions;fake measurement data;system state transition rules;system state values;strong attack ability;remote programmable logic controllers","","7","","43","CCBY","25 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Load shedding and fast VAR devices are used in the corrective state in order to quickly restore system stability even though they are expensive, while cheap slow VAR devices can be used in the preventive state to obtain the desired security level. The main objective of this paper is to make a trade-off between economy and security by determining the optimal combination of fast and slow controls (load shedding, new slow and fast VAR devices). To meet the desired security limits, a variety of constraints have to be considered during the investigated transitions states. The proposed RPP problem is a combinatorial optimization problem, which cannot be solved easily by conventional optimization methods. Swarm optimization methods are reported to be efficient to solve combinatorial optimization problems. This paper discovers the efficiency of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Evolutionary PSO (EPSO) in solving the proposed RPP problem.

Likewise, many security solutions now exist within SDN environments for detecting and blocking clients who violate network policies. However, many of these solutions stop at triggering the security measure and give little thought to amending it. As a consequence, once the violation is addressed, no clear path exists for reinstating the flagged client beyond having the network operator reset the controller or manually implement a state change via an external command. This presents a burden for the network and its clients and administrators. Hence, we present a security policy transition framework for revoking security measures in an SDN environment once said measures are activated.","","978-1-5090-0933-6","10.1109/NFV-SDN.2016.7919476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7919476","Security Policy Transitions;Software Defined Networks;SDN;Network Operating System;NOS;Network Security Policies;Network Access Control;NAC;RYU;Ryuretic","Software;Access control;Ports (Computers);Kinetic theory;Monitoring","computer network security;software defined networking","security policy transition framework;software defined networks;programming frameworks;network application development;SDN environments;external command","","5","","17","IEEE","8 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach is based on a probabilistic extension of the value-passing Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS), which is a common formal language for modeling concurrent systems. Our approach gives a uniform security model for different security scenarios. We present then a uniform algorithm for computing the Nash equilibria strategies on this security model. In a nutshell, the algorithm first generates a network state transition graph for our security model, then simplifies this transition graph through graph-theoretic abstraction and bisimulation minimization. Then, a backward induction method, which is only applicable to finite tree models, can be used to compute all the Nash equilibria strategies of the (possibly infinite) security models. This algorithm is implemented and can be tuned smoothly for computing its social optimal strategies, and its termination and correctness are proved. The effectiveness and efficiency of this approach are demonstrated with two detailed examples from the field of network security.","2324-9013","978-1-5090-3205-1","10.1109/TrustCom.2016.0078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7846961","Network security;Nash equilibria strategies;Formal method;Probabilistic value-passing CCS","Security;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic;Communication networks;Reactive power;Games;Analytical models","calculus of communicating systems;computer network security;formal languages;game theory","modelling;network security scenarios;game theory;network security games;probabilistic extension;value-passing calculus of communicating systems;CCS;formal language;concurrent systems;uniform security models;Nash equilibria strategies;network state transition graph;graph-theoretic abstraction;bisimulation minimization;backward induction method;finite tree models","","1","","23","IEEE","9 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As one successful method, state transition (ST) analysis models penetrations as a series of state changes that lead from initial state to a target compromised state. Using this model of recomposing the ST method to solve the low recognizing ratio problem is presented in this paper. In this model, ST method can be expressed in a double DNA chains pattern. One chain is the system state chain; the other is an action chain. The double twisting chains form a state-action sequence to represent the system state transitions.

Furthermore, the unique software architecture of a bare PC enables the TLS, TCP, and application protocols to be intertwined, thereby reducing the communication overhead compared to that of a conventional system. As an example, we give details of the internal architecture of a bare PC TLS Web server. We then illustrate intertwining of the TLS, TCP, and HTTP protocols.

Recent trends of IP piracy and reverse-engineering are causing major revenue loss to the IP vendors. A large majority of hardware IPs comes in register transfer level (RTL) description due to their portability and flexibility to map to any technology platform. In this paper, we propose a key-based security through obscurity approach for protecting RTL hardware IPs. The RTL design is first transformed into a technology-independent gate-level description and the functionality of the resulting gate-level netlist is then changed through modification of its state transition function. This process allows normal operation only on the successful application of a correct initialization sequence. The modified gate-level design is then decompiled to generate an obfuscated version of the RTL. Major RTL constructs and macros are optionally preserved through the transformation process using a forward annotation file. The proposed methodology differs from existing hardware obfuscation as well as watermarking techniques in its ability to achieve simultaneous functional and semantic obfuscation for RTL description of IP at low design overhead. Simulation results for a set of open-source IP cores show that we can achieve high levels of security through a well-formulated obfuscation scheme incurring nominal area, delay and power overhead.","","978-1-4244-4805-0","10.1109/HST.2009.5224963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5224963","Hardware IP Protection;IP piracy;RTL obfuscation","Protection;Watermarking;Cryptography;Open source software;Reverse engineering;Hardware design languages;Design methodology;Computer security;Registers;System-on-a-chip","industrial property;integrated circuit design;reverse engineering;security of data;system-on-chip;watermarking","system-on-chip designs;register transfer level hardware IP;bug-free hardware intellectual property cores;IP piracy;reverse engineering;register transfer level description;key-based security;technology-independent gate-level description;watermarking techniques;correct initialization sequence","","23","4","13","IEEE","28 Aug 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As technology and grid infrastructure evolve to develop more advanced WAPAC applications, however, so do the attack surfaces in the grid infrastructure. This paper presents an attack-resilient system (ARS) for the WAPAC cybersecurity by seamlessly integrating the network intrusion detection system (NIDS) with intrusion mitigation and prevention system (IMPS). In particular, the proposed NIDS utilizes signature and behavior-based rules to detect attack reconnaissance, communication failure, and data integrity attacks. Further, the proposed IMPS applies state transition-based mitigation and prevention strategies to quickly restore the normal grid operation after cyberattacks. As a proof of concept, we validate the proposed generic architecture of ARS by performing experimental case study for wide-area protection scheme (WAPS), one of the critical WAPAC applications, and evaluate the proposed NIDS and IMPS components of ARS in a cyber-physical testbed environment. Our experimental results reveal a promising performance in detecting and mitigating different classes of cyberattacks while supporting an alert visualization dashboard to provide an accurate situational awareness in real-time.","","978-1-7281-8693-1","10.1109/RWS50334.2020.9241291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9241291","","Power system stability;Tools;Control systems;Real-time systems;Smart grids;Computer crime;Resilience","data integrity;energy management systems;power system control;power system security;security of data;smart power grids","intrusion mitigation;network intrusion detection system;WAPAC cybersecurity;attack-resilient system;attack surfaces;advanced WAPAC applications;grid infrastructure;system stability;wide-area communication network;energy management system;smart grid;control system;attack-resilient wide-area protection;critical WAPAC applications;wide-area protection scheme;normal grid operation;prevention strategies;state transition-based mitigation;data integrity attacks;attack reconnaissance;behavior-based rules;NIDS;prevention system","","3","","18","IEEE","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the adoption of wireless communication and network techniques, train control systems are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Notably, the jamming attacks, aiming at the handoff process that is the weakest part of train ground communication systems, will cause long disruption of communication. It will have a severe impact on train control operation efficiency. Current research regarding industry control system security is hard to model the impact of the jamming attacks on the train control system quantitatively, and current countermeasure schemes against jamming attacks are not designed for the operating mechanism of train control systems. This paper first builds the train control security state transition probability model under jamming attacks. A cross-layer defense scheme is then proposed from the aspect of the physical layer, the cyber layer and the management layer. In the physical layer, this paper designs a model prediction control algorithm to track dynamic target signals, in the hopes of eventually tracking the dynamic target quickly and smoothly. In the cyber layer, a multi-stage and zero-sum stochastic game model is built for the channel selection for the attack and the defense, whereby the channel selection randomized policy will be obtained. In the management layer, a dynamic train travel speed profile generation algorithm is proposed to mitigate the jamming attacks’ impact on train control systems. Extensive simulation results are shown that jamming attack impact on CBTC can be mitigated effectively with our proposed cross-layer defense scheme.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3005931","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2018JBM076); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973026); Beijing Municipal Education Commission Funding(grant numbers:I20H100010,I19H100010); Beijing Science and Technology Commission Funding(grant numbers:Z191100010818001); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L181004); Project(grant numbers:RCS2019ZT010,RCS2018K008,2018JBZ002); Beijing Traffic Control Technology (BJTCT) Innovation Funding(grant numbers:9907006509); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142439","Communication-based train control (CBTC);security;cross-layer defense;stochastic game","Jamming;Games;Security;Control systems;Physical layer;Stochastic processes;Communication systems","jamming;mobility management (mobile radio);predictive control;railway communication;railway engineering;stochastic games;target tracking;telecommunication security;wireless channels","cross-layer defense methods;jamming-resistant CBTC systems;communication-based train control systems;jamming attacks;train ground communication systems;train control operation efficiency;train control security state transition probability model;cross-layer defense scheme;physical layer;cyber layer;management layer;model prediction control algorithm;dynamic train travel speed profile generation algorithm;industry control system security;handoff process;zero-sum stochastic game model","","37","","42","IEEE","16 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there exist several security vulnerabilities in the TCP specification and additional weaknesses in a number of its implementations. These vulnerabilities may allow an intruder to ""attack"" TCP-based systems, enabling him/her to ""hijack"" a TCP connection or cause denial of service to legitimate users. The authors analyze the TCP code via a ""reverse engineering"" technique called ""program slicing"" to identify several of these vulnerabilities, especially those that are related to the TCP state-transition diagram. They discuss many of the flaws present in the TCP implementation of many widely used operating systems, such as SUNOS 4.1.3, SVR4, and ULTRIX 4.3. The corresponding TCP attack ""signatures"" (including the well-known 1994 Christmas Day Mitnick Attack) are described, and recommendations are provided to improve the security state of a TCP-based system (e.g., incorporation of a ""timer escape route"" from every TCP state). Also, it is anticipated that wide dissemination of this article's results may not only lead to vendor patches to TCP code to plug security holes, but also raise awareness of how program slicing may be used to analyze other networking software and how future designs of TCP and other software can be improved.","1558-156X","","10.1109/65.598458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=598458","","Reverse engineering;TCPIP;Security;Transport protocols;Computer networks;Computer crime;Operating systems;Plugs;Hardware;Internetworking","transport protocols;security of data;computer networks;reverse engineering;network operating systems","reverse engineering;TCP code;network security;security vulnerability analysis;Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol;TCP/IP;computing facilities interconnection;TCP specification;TCP connection;program slicing;TCP state-transition diagram;TCP implementation;operating systems;SUNOS 4.1.3;SVR4;ULTRIX 4.3;TCP attack signatures;Christmas Day Mitnick Attack;timer escape route;networking software","","8","24","22","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Various security mechanisms employed in the network does not give the complete picture of security of complete network. In this paper we have proposed taxonomy and ontology which may be used to infer impact of various events happening in the network on security status of the network. Vulnerability, Network and Attack are the main taxonomy classes in the ontology. Vulnerability class describes various types of vulnerabilities in the network which may in hardware components like storage devices, computing devices or networks devices. Attack class has many subclasses like Actor class which is entity executing the attack, Goal class describes goal of the attack, Attack mechanism class defines attack methodology, Scope class describes size and utility of the target, Automation level describes the automation level of the attack Evaluation of security status of the network is required for network security situational awareness. Network class has network operating system, users, roles, hardware components and services as its subclasses. Based on this taxonomy ontology has been developed to perceive network security status.

Various security solutions have been proposed and implemented to protect users' data from unknown threats. Majority of these solutions are realized employing traditional networking techniques that are complex and extremely difficult to manage. These techniques rely on manual configuration of devices resulting in policy conflicts, which may compromise the network security. This issue can be addressed by adopting Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm which provides a network-wide visibility, centralized control, flexible network architecture and ease of management, by separating control plane (network controller) and the data plane (forwarding devices). The controller monitors, manages and controls the behaviour of the forwarding devices using OpenFlow protocol.

SIP being a text-based protocol is vulnerable to a range of denial of service (DoS) attacks. These DoS attacks can render the SIP servers/SIP proxy servers unusable by depleting memory and CPU time. In this paper, we consider two types of DoS attacks, namely, flooding attacks and coordinated attacks for detection. Flooding attacks affect both stateless and stateful SIP servers while coordinated attacks affect stateful SIP servers. We model the SIP operation as discrete event system (DES) and design a new state transition machine, which we name as probabilistic counting deterministic timed automata (PCDTA) to describe the behavior of SIP operations. We also identify different types of anomalies that can occur in a DES model, which appear in the form of illegal transitions, violating timing constraints, and appear in number which is otherwise not seen. Subsequently, we map various DoS attacks in SIP to a type of anomaly in DES. PCDTA can learn probabilities of various transitions and timings delay from a set of nonmalicious training sequences. A trained PCDTA can detect anomalies, and hence various DoS attacks in SIP. We perform a thorough experiment with computer simulated SIP traffic and report the detection performance of PCDTA on various attacks generated through custom scripts.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2016.2632071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755836","Communication system security;Computer security;Network security","Servers;Computer crime;Discrete-event systems;Registers;Protocols;Authentication;Floods","computer network security;discrete event systems;Internet telephony;probabilistic automata;signalling protocols","anomalous behavior detection;VoIP systems;discrete event system modeling;session initiation protocol;application layer protocol;voice over IP connections;DoS attacks;flooding attacks;coordinated attacks;stateless SIP servers;stateful SIP servers;DES;state transition machine;probabilistic counting deterministic timed automata;PCDTA","","21","","41","IEEE","23 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, the adopted security protection mechanisms often depend on the node state, location, and/or surrounding risk, which need the capability of context-aware security quantification. This paper views the security level as a user's inherent property that is only correlated with the user's behaviours and the situated context and independent of the suffered attack ways. We propose a formalized methodology to especially quantify the security level in real time from the perspective of state transition probability through estimating the stable probability of staying in the security state in inhomogeneous continuous time Markov chain. This paradigm enables users to customize the security protection mechanisms for adapting to the frequently varying context. We conduct the extensive numerical calculations and empirical analysis to comprehensively investigate the response of the proposed security quantification framework to the various combinations of the concerned parameters, e.g., SNR, velocity, and traffic flow.

FSMs should be accurately extracted for watermark insertion, fault injection assessment of control paths in a system-on-chip (SoC), information leakage assessment, control-flow reverse engineering in RTL abstraction, logic obfuscation, etc. However, it is quite unfortunate that, as of today, existing state-of-the-art synthesis tools cannot provide accurate and reliable extraction of all FSMs from the provided high-level RTL code. Precise identification of all FSM state registers and the pure combinational state transition logic described in the RTL code with numerous registers and other combinational logic makes it quite challenging to develop such a solution. In this paper, we propose a framework named RTL-FSMx to extract FSMs from high-level RTL codes written in Verilog HDL. RTL-FSMx utilizes node-based analysis on the abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the RTL code to isolate FSM state registers from other registers. RTL-FSMx automatically extracts state transition graphs (STGs) for each of the detected FSM state registers and additional information of the extracted FSMs. Experimental results on a large number of benchmark circuits demonstrate that RTL-FSMx accurately recovers all control FSMs from RTL codes with various complexity and size within just a few seconds.","2378-2250","978-1-6654-6270-9","10.1109/ITC50671.2022.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9983935","Register Transfer Level;FSM Extraction;HDL Code Analysis;Security Assessment;FSM Automata Theory","Codes;Automata;Watermarking;Benchmark testing;Very large scale integration;Registers;Complexity theory","finite state machines;graph theory;hardware description languages;logic design;reverse engineering;system-on-chip","accurate extraction;accurate finite state machine extraction;control FSMs;control-flow reverse engineering;detected FSM state registers;extracted FSMs;fault injection assessment;finite state machines;high-level RTL code;information leakage assessment;precise extraction;pure combinational state transition logic;register-transfer level description;reliable extraction;RTL abstraction;RTL-FSMx utilizes;security vulnerability assessment solutions;state transition graphs;state-of-the-art synthesis tools","","","","68","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A resilient hybrid control scheme is proposed to mitigate the impact of these cyber-attacks.

Now electric supply industries are undergoing restructuring and deregulation, and the operation modes are getting more complicated, electric components are operating near to their security limits along with the probability of fault increasing largely, and operation modes changing more frequently. Automatic fault section identification and expert-system-based switch operation instructing system are much helpful to improve the intelligent level of dispatching operation. At present automatic fault section identification system (AFSIS) as aided decision-making for the operators is put into the field, switch operation instructing system (SOIS) also does. But these systems almost belong to a single agent, with power systems rapidly expanding, they have exposed to some limits. On the basis of research on AFSIS and SOIS for many years, a multi-agent system (MAS) based dispatching operation instructing scheme is proposed in this paper. The cooperation between AFSIS and SOIS is the key problem to study. A task decomposing method based on structural property, and a hybrid coordination control strategy is presented. More researches are focused on MAS task decomposition, coordinated control, data share, communication implementation and MAS learning. A MAS-based dispatching operation instructing system (MASDOIS) is implemented and put into the field.

The performance of this model is favorable when the system operates in normal conditions but tends to suffer while the system state dramatically changes. Moreover, its accuracy and convergence is sensitive to the value of the process noise covariance matrix. The other subsystem, with some opposite characteristics, utilizes a pseudo-dynamic model derived from the linearization of the power flow equation. A switching rule based on the innovations is established to make a tradeoff between the two subsystems with regard to estimation accuracy, converge speed, and computing time. Apart from the difference in the reporting rate of various measurements, cyber attacks, such as DoS attacks may result in the absence of measurements in the snapshot of SE at the finest time scale. To deal with this problem, the linear extrapolation and multistep prediction techniques are involved.

Some previous studies have adopted formal methods, but their models cannot express parallel communication completely. This limitation gives rise to problems where web functions, such as a cache that stores contents, cannot be defined and attacks that forge contents cannot be analyzed. These problems are present in the Alloy-based implementations of current models that do not have the ability to express temporal logic. Therefore, we design implementation and evaluation of temporal logic in Alloy to express time series and parallel computation for web security analysis. In doing so, state transitions in the web can be expressed by fitting them in our proposed syntax. As concrete applications, we describe a web security model that includes caches and show that our proposed syntax can analyze state-of-the-art attacks, such as unauthorized access to users' account pages via caches.

In the proposed game model, the virus is supposed to propagate itself in a cyber network connecting cyber nodes belonging to power substations. Each cyber node may play as an attacker or a defender according to its state. A death-birth rule is adopted to model probabilistic strategies and state transfers, which reflects the bounded rationality of the viruses. Then, an evolution dynamic equation is derived to obtain the portion of the infected substations when the equilibrium is reached, and simulation algorithm is also given to estimate the infection probability of each substation under the persistent virus-based intrusion. Assuming a virus may trip all breakers in the infected substation, the cyber-security risk is evaluated to identify system-level vulnerabilities.

Recent studies have proven that delays in providing healthcare are directly linked to patient confidence and chances of recovery. An unreliable storage of health records has only aggravated the problem. Our paper aims to provide a solution for these issues by proposing a Blockchain-Internet of things model where a bio-sensor measures and collects real time data with respect to a patient's medical status and stores it in the blockchain. In this way quick reporting and tamper proof storage of data occurs. By deploying a smart contract the final hospital bill can be calculated along with insurance coverage. This would negate the need of third party providers and create a transparent system. Our paper also proposes the use of Inter planetary file system to store discharged patients records thus reducing the load on the actual blockchain.

Without regard to the internet access, if the user can get the time-stamp anywhere, time-stamping can use in many other situations. This paper proposes an offline time-stamping scheme. The scheme generates the time-stamp in a user's terminal using TPM. TPM is a security chip. In this scheme, TPM is used for preventing a terminal user from generating a time-stamp containing falsified time. This paper shows an example of a design and an implementation of an offline time-stamping system based on the scheme. The system is designed in the REST -over-HTTP style. By using HTTP, the development is simplified because it is not necessary to build an interface, API, or others for each system a developer need to build. The implemented system can issue a time-stamp about 1,140ms under the experimental environment.","","978-1-4673-3143-2","10.1109/ICCSCE.2012.6487179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487179","Time-Stamping;RFC3161;Trusted Platform Module;Offline-Type;Representational State Transfer","","document handling;Internet;security of data","offline time stamping system;time stamping services;document protection;Internet access;security chip;time stamping system;HTTP style","","","","16","IEEE","28 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a synergistic combination of Surrogate Augmented Lagrangian Relaxation and branch-and-cut is presented. With system coupling constraints relaxed and quadratic penalties on constraint violations added, the augmented Lagrangian is innovatively linearized and decomposed into subproblems to be solved by branch-and-cut. Subproblem solutions are then effectively coordinated based on Surrogate subgradients with much reduced computation requirements and multiplier zigzagging, and accelerated reduction of constraint violations.

Unfortunately, existing software and even hardware approaches for finding and identifying memory bugs have considerable performance overheads, target only a narrow class of bugs, are costly to implement, or use computational resources inefficiently. This paper describes MemTracker, a new hardware support mechanism that can be configured to perform different kinds of memory access monitoring tasks. MemTracker associates each word of data in memory with a few bits of state, and uses a programmable state transition table to react to different events that can affect this state. The number of state bits per word, the events to which MemTracker reacts, and the transition table are all fully programmable. MemTracker's rich set of states, events, and transitions can be used to implement different monitoring and debugging checkers with minimal performance overheads, even when frequent state updates are needed. To evaluate MemTracker, we map three different checkers onto it, as well as a checker that combines all three. For the most demanding (combined) checker, we observe performance overheads of only 2.7% on average and 4.8% worst-case on SPEC 2000 applications. Such low overheads allow continuous (always-on) use of MemTracker-enabled checkers even in production runs","2378-203X","1-4244-0804-0","10.1109/HPCA.2007.346205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147668","","Monitoring;Computer bugs;Hardware;Software debugging;Security;Software tools;Buffer overflow;Memory management;Software performance;Application software","checkpointing;program debugging;software metrics;storage management;system monitoring","MemTracker;memory access monitoring;memory access debugging;software complexity;programmable state transition table;monitoring checker;debugging checker","","81","2","24","IEEE","10 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

VFS policies aim at reducing the CPU energy, while DPM-based solutions involve putting the system components (e.g., memory or I/O devices) to low-power/sleep states at runtime, when sufficiently long idle intervals can be predicted. Despite numerous research papers that tackled the energy minimization problem using VFS or DPM separately, the interactions of these two popular techniques are not yet well understood. In this paper, we undertake an exact analysis of the problem for a real-time embedded application running on a VFS-enabled CPU and using multiple devices. Specifically, by adopting a generalized system-level energy model, we characterize the variations in different components of the system energy as a function of the CPU processing frequency. Then, we propose a provably optimal and efficient algorithm to determine the optimal CPU frequency as well as device state transition decisions to minimize the system-level energy. We also extend our solution to deal with workload variability. The experimental evaluations confirm that substantial energy savings can be obtained through our solution that combines VFS and DPM optimally under the given task and energy models.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2010.248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5669265","Real-time systems;energy management;voltage/frequency scaling;device power management.","Algorithm design and analysis;Throughput;Performance evaluation;Benchmark testing;Power demand;Quality of service;Security","embedded systems;power aware computing","voltage-frequency scaling;device power management;frame based real time embedded applications;CPU energy;power-sleep states;energy minimization problem;CPU processing frequency;device state transition decisions;system level energy","","74","","37","IEEE","17 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it will give attackers the possibility of discovering vulnerabilities in the system, and the control systems lack the ability of dynamic perception of security state and risk, causing the systems to be exposed to risks. In this article, a dynamic Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model is proposed. The conditional random field (CRF) is introduced into the BLP model to optimize the rules. First, the model formalizes the security attributes, states of system, transition rules, and constraint models on the basis of the state transition of CRFs. After the historical system access logs are processed as the original dataset, a feature selection method is proposed to extract the requests and current states as feature vectors. Second, this article presents a rules training algorithm based on L-BFGS to implement the study and training of datasets, and then marks the logs in the test set through Viterbi algorithm automatically. On the base of these, a rule generation algorithm is proposed to dynamically adjust the access control rules based on the current security status and events of the system. Third, the security of CRFs-BLP is proved by theoretical analysis. Finally, the validity and accuracy of the model are verified by estimating the value of the precision, recall, and F1-score.

Stimulation results on two test cases show that the dynamic profile of the cascading failures in the coupled system displays a “staircase-like” pattern, which can be interpreted as a combined feature of the typical step propagation profile triggered repeatedly by cyber attacks due to network coupling.

As the attacks become more variable and complex, there is an urgent need for dynamic defense methods. In this paper, we propose a security function virtualization (SFV) based moving target defense of SDSG which makes the attack surface constantly changing. First, we design a dynamic defense mechanism by migrating virtual security function (VSF) instances as the traffic state changes. The centralized SDN controller is re-designed for global status monitoring and migration management.

However, it is less efficient to fuzz the stateful protocols due to the difficulties like maintaining states and dependencies of messages. To address these challenges, we present SPFuzz, a framework for building flexible, coverage-guided stateful protocol fuzzing. We define a language in SPFuzz to describe the protocol specifications, protocol states transitions and dependencies for generating valuable test cases, maintaining correct messages in session states and handling protocol dependencies by updating message data in time. The SPFuzz adopts a three-level mutation strategy, namely head, content, and sequence mutation strategy to drive the fuzzing process to cover more paths, in conjunction with the method to randomly assign weights to messages and strategies. We use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of SPFuzz and other frameworks upon three protocol implementations, i.e., Proftpd, Oftpd, and OpenSSL, which are three-granularity coverages specifically function, basic block, and edge. In experiments, the SPFuzz framework outperforms the existing stateful protocol fuzzing tool Boofuzz by an average of 69.12% in three granularities coverage tests. This demonstrates that the SPFuzz has the ability to explore more and deeper paths of the target program. We further triggered CVE-2015-0291 in OpenSSL 1.0.2 with the SPFuzz, which proves the validity and utility of our framework.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2895025","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0200401); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; National High-level Personnel for Defense Technology Program(grant numbers:2017-JCJQ-ZQ-013); HUNAN Province Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017RS3045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8626141","AFL;coverage;fuzzing;network protocol;software security","Protocols;Fuzzing;Tools;Servers;Security;Schedules;Engines","program testing;protocols;telecommunication scheduling","hierarchical scheduling framework;stateful network protocol fuzzing;fuzzing technology;coverage improvement;target program;coverage-guided stateful protocol fuzzing;protocol specifications;protocol states transitions;correct messages;session states;handling protocol dependencies;message data;three-level mutation strategy;sequence mutation strategy;fuzzing process;protocol implementations;SPFuzz framework;granularities coverage tests;stateful protocol fuzzing tool Boofuzz","","14","","37","OAPA","25 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The CSCs possess several good properties such as simplicity, scalability, and efficiency in hardware. In the initial version of the CSC, the output of the last cell was directly used as the keystream. In this paper, we propose a backward state transition (BST) attack that exploits this structure and is able to break the cipher. To defeat the BST attack, two modifications of the CSC structure are proposed. In the modified CSC, outputs from two cells are combined, and the output of the last cell is used in a feedback loop.

In this paper, a successful intrusion is regarded as a probabilistic event related to reconnaissance activities. Its probability can be approximated by the Poisson distribution of the number of vulnerabilities discovered by the attacker. Furthermore, models of intrusion and defense in competition for control of the substations are proposed using Markov decision process (MDP). Key characteristics of target substation, attacker and defender are considered for determining probabilistic state transitions related to intrusion and defense actions. Thus, by solving the MDP models, the optimal strategies (action policies) of both the attacker and defender can be obtained. With these optimal strategies, the cyber security status of a substation can be evaluated within varied time frames.

In that case, we can move from trying to build the perfectly secure system to continue asking questions like “how much vulnerability do I have and what control do I need to be effective?” This paper proposes Security Chaos Engineering as a method to expose API vulnerabilities and enhance API security. RESTful API has gained popularity in recent years due to its reusability, flexibility and natural adaptation to modern web application, mobile application, and cloud computing. However, ensuring secure API/data access and hence mitigating reputational and/or financial damage to the organization is still in its early stage. Foundational security protection mechanisms include transport layer security, authentication / authorization of the consumer (either individual or application). To complete the spectrum of secure API access and provide advanced protection, there is much more to consider: mitigation of API specific vulnerabilities at design and implementation time. API Security using Chaos Engineering is an approach for learning about system security behavers when using APIs by applying empirical exploration. Security Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting to build confidence in the system’s security and see how a system can withstand threats in production. Security Chaos Engineering isn’t about creating chaos.

Unfortunately, as of today, there are no good solutions available that can provide very fast and accurate extraction of FSMs from the flattened netlist to perform effective security assessment. The difficulty of developing such a solution lies in precisely identifying FSM state flip-flops present in a netlist that contains numerous circuit flip-flops. In this paper, we propose to develop a framework called FSMx to extract FSMs from highly unstructured synthesized designs. FSMx utilizes graph theory to identify FSM state registers from other registers. FSMx automatically extracts gate-level state transition graphs (STGs) for each of the detected FSM state registers. Experimental results demonstrate that FSMx efficiently recovers FSMs from synthesized netlists with various complexity and size in less than 7 minutes in the worst case of NIST AES 128-bit design with 12,976 gates on a personal desktop.","2375-1053","978-1-6654-1060-1","10.1109/VTS52500.2021.9794151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9794151","FSM Extraction;Flattened Gate-Level Netlist Analysis;Security Validation;FSM Automata Theory","Reverse engineering;Automata;Watermarking;Logic gates;Very large scale integration;NIST;Graph theory","cryptography;finite state machines;flip-flops;graph theory;logic design;reverse engineering;security of data;system-on-chip","gate-level state transition graphs;detected FSM state registers;FSMx;synthesized netlists;finite state machine extraction;flattened netlist;security vulnerability assessments;fast extraction;finite state machines;watermark insertion;FSM-based logic locking;fault injection assessment;control paths;information leakage assessment;effective security assessment;numerous circuit;highly unstructured synthesized designs;time 7.0 min","","","","41","IEEE","15 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, the 5G system, state transition properties and security properties were abstracted from 3GPP specifications. To mimic an attacker’s behavior, a Dolev-Yao adversary model was constructed in the 5G model by empowering it with NAS signalling security testing knowledge and reasonable security capabilities in the wireless channel. Then we used the TAMARIN prover to verify all the abstracted properties one by one and discovered some protocol vulnerabilities based on the counterexamples found. We further verified these vulnerabilities on the testbed and identified 10 new 5G protocol vulnerabilities. Moreover, we analyzed the root cause of these vulnerabilities and concluded that all of them were caused by the unconditional trust between UE and gNodeB. Therefore, we propose an improved PKI mechanism based on the existing asymmetric encryption of 5G.

The traditional security mechanisms such as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is no longer as feasible in protecting WSN as in wired networks. The new concept of trust has emerged in recent studies as an alternative mechanism to address the security concerns in WSNs. Most recent studies on trust are mainly focused on how to model and evaluate trust so as to effectively detect, isolate, and avoid any malicious activity in the network. In this paper, we have introduced the new angle of adaptive network approach to study 'dynamics on networks' i.e., trust state transition on a network with a fixed topology or 'dynamics of networks' i.e., topological transformation of a network with no dynamic trust state changes separately so as to discover the interplay between network overlay entities' trust evaluation and its underlie topological connectivity. Inspired from the trust studies in sociology, we propose that the Simmelian tie structured networks enable more positive impact on fostering trustworthiness among sensor nodes, while structural hole characterized networks provide more opportunity for misbehaviors and have negative impact to secure WSNs. These hypothesis have been confirmed by the extensive simulation studies.","","978-1-4673-7952-6","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345270","Security;Wireless sensor networks;Trust and reputation management;Adaptive networks;Topological metrics;Simmelian tie and structural hole","Wireless sensor networks;Network topology;Measurement;Security;Adaptive systems;Topology;Sociology","public key cryptography;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Simmelian tie structured networks;structural holes;topological roles;trust formation;wireless sensor network security;WSN;open-access;error-prone wireless environments;public key infrastructure;PKI;wired networks;adaptive network approach;trust state transition;fixed topology;network dynamics;topological transformation;underlie topological connectivity;sociology","","1","","27","IEEE","3 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The amount of stored information is so huge that it is highly difficult to manage the content especially in a distributed cloud environment. There are many open source software solutions available in cloud to handle huge amount of digital data. However none of these solutions addresses all the requirements needed to manage the content spread out in multiple systems effectively. The user has to relay on multiple content management systems to do the work. This turns into ever more unwieldy, time consuming and leads to loss of data. Using robust and integrated content management systems, these issues could be solved effectively. In this paper we have identified various challenges of using the content management system in the cloud after surveying many Content Management System related article and proposed an integrated solution named Cloud based Architecture integrating Content Management System which is capable of interfacing with various unique features available at different content management system installations in the cloud. This maximizes the functionality and performance of any Content management systems. The Representational State Transfer (REST) protocol is used to integrate the best features of various open source content management systems. REST provides higher level of security compared to existing systems as it does not store the user sessions. The users can interact with the system with the help of an interface which abstracts the complexities of multiple content management systems running in the cloud.","","978-1-5090-5960-7","10.1109/ICIMIA.2017.7975631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975631","CMS;Open Source;Cloud;REST;PhP;MYSQL;Web Services","Content management;Cloud computing;Security;Organizations;Tools;Computer architecture","cloud computing;content management;data handling;public domain software;security of data","cloud based architecture;digital content;distributed cloud environment;open source software;digital data handling;Representational State Transfer protocol;REST protocol;open source content management systems;security","","","","15","IEEE","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Security is important for communication over the network and to provide security one can use encryption methods which are implemented in Representational State Transfer (REST) API authentication. Message Digest 5 (MD5) and Secure Hashing Algorithm 1 (SHA1) encryption are algorithms that are often used in this case. This study aims to examine the performance of the two algorithms. The Wireshark application is used to retrieve authentication data. Authentication data is still encrypted, then tested by Brute Force Attack using Hashcat tools. In addition, each algorithm is measured in terms of the time needed for the REST API Authentication process, which uses the Postman application. Based on Brute Force Attack testing the SHA1 encryption algorithm has the advantage of being stronger, but the time needed for encryption is slower when compared to the MD5 algorithm. Even though it's more tethered, the difference in encryption time needed is only 37.1 ms, so that SHA1 is still considered relevant for implementing security systems and REST API authentication on a mobile application.","","978-1-7281-1655-6","10.1109/ICOIACT46704.2019.8938570","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8938570","Authentication;MD5;Mobile Data Security;Rest API;SHA1","Authentication;Encryption;Servers;Force;Testing","application program interfaces;client-server systems;cryptography;message authentication","authentication data;Brute Force Attack;REST API Authentication process;Postman application;SHA1 encryption algorithm;MD5 algorithm;encryption time;security systems;mobile application;SHA1 algorithms;mobile-based Application;mobile-based applications;client-server system;encryption methods;wireshark application;representational state transfer API authentication;Client-Server system;encrypt REST API authentication;time 37.1 ms","","1","","17","IEEE","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This type of storage has several issues, such as privacy and data integrity, because several parties will fully regulate privacy and data integrity. Therefore, a data storage system is needed that can provide privacy, security, and data integrity to maintain the authenticity of sensitive data. This study wants to develop to implement blockchain technology to store employee attendance data from the HR department in a company. Employee attendance data is taken from the Angular web application integrated with a permissioned blockchain framework called Hyperledger Composer. This study chose Hyperledger Composer because this type of blockchain has a fast validation time. Hyperledger Composer has a Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API) named composer-rest-server, which allows Hyperledger blockchain to interact with other components. The implementation results show that Hyperledger Composer can be functionally used as data storage for the attendance management and Payroll system. In addition, Hyperledger Composer performance is measured by evaluating block transaction times. The evaluation of the Hyperledger Composer is done in three ways: directly within the Hyperledger Composer, using the Angular web application through the REST API, and using JMeter through the REST API. As a result, testing for making transaction blocks varies from 1 - 17ms on an experiment directly in Hyperledger Composer, 5 - 296ms through the REST API using JMeter tools, and 1 - 4270ms through the Angular Web Application. The result shows that the performance of the REST API produced by the composer-rest-server is recorded faster than Ethereum. With these results, composer-rest-server can handle systems that require fast transaction times, such as voting systems, health monitoring, and the Internet of Things (IoT) application, because the average time to conduct transactions is still under one second. Thus, Hyperledger as attendance data storage can provide privacy and data integrity.","2642-6102","978-1-6654-6658-5","10.1109/TENSYMP54529.2022.9864383","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9864383","blockchain;Hyperledger;composer-rest-server;attendance;REST API","Data privacy;Distributed ledger;Data integrity;Memory;Companies;Blockchains;Representational state transfer","application program interfaces;data integrity;data privacy;human resource management;Internet;payroll data processing;transaction processing;Web services","blockchain-based attendance management;payroll system;data integrity;data storage system;employee attendance data;Angular web application;representational state transfer application programming interface;REST API;hyperledger blockchain;hyperledger composer;attendance data storage;block transaction times;JMeter;data privacy;time 1.0 ms to 17.0 ms;time 5.0 ms to 296.0 ms;time 1.0 ms to 4270.0 ms","","","","13","IEEE","29 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two new technologies make this scaling possible without any virtualization software: 1) self-transition management and 2) unified virtual address mapping. Evaluations show that this domain control provides highly scalable performance and incurs almost no performance overhead in security domains. The increase in binary code size is less than 40KB, and the time required for individual state transitions is of a single-millisecond order.

The emergence of high-speed networks in electric power systems creates a tight interaction of cyberinfrastructure with the physical infrastructure and makes the power system susceptible to cyber penetration and attacks. To address this problem, this paper proposes an innovative approach to develop a specification-based intrusion detection framework that leverages available information provided by components in a contemporary power system. An autoencoder is used to encode the causal relations among the available information to create patterns with temporal state transitions, which are used as features in the proposed intrusion detection.

In this paper, we establish a zero-sum hybrid stochastic game model, that can be used for designing defense policies for cyber-physical systems against attackers of different types. The hybrid game model contains physical states described by the system dynamics, and a cyber state that represents the detection mode of the system. A system selects a subsystem by combining one controller, one estimator and one detector among a finite set of candidate components at each state. In order to provide scalable and real-time computation of the switching strategies, we propose a moving-horizon approach to solve the zero-sum hybrid stochastic game, and obtain a saddle-point equilibrium policy for balancing the system's security overhead and control cost. This approach leads to a real-time algorithm that yields a sequence of Nash equilibrium strategies which can be shown to converge.

Different from previous approaches where DSU is described from the viewpoint of program's internal state transitions, our framework focuses on program's external behavior and its effect on its environment. This more abstract view avoids over specification of DSU and allows for better DSU flexibility.

The technique camouflages malicious communications as common protocols or generally innocent applications to avoid network security audit, which has been widely used in advanced Trojans, botnets, as well as anonymous communication systems, bringing a great challenge to current network management and security. To this end, we propose a general network protocol mimicry behavior discovery framework named MimicHunter to detect such evasive masquerade behaviors, which exploits protocol structure and state transition verifications, as well as primary protocol behavior elements. Experiment results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in practice. Besides, MimicHunter is flexible in deployment and can be easily implemented in passive detection systems with only a little cost compared with the active methods.","","978-1-4673-7952-6","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345292","protocol mimicry;intrusion detection;evasive attack;protocol structure;state transition","Protocols;MIMICs;Payloads;Inspection;Intrusion detection;Malware","security of data","MimicHunter framework;passive network protocol mimicry detection framework;network based intrusion;information theft events;network security devices;firewall;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;IDS-IPS;Web application firewall;evasive techniques;network security audit","","1","","31","IEEE","3 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The concept of resilience is introducing to measure the ability of the system to maintain its function under attack. It matters in evaluating the security of modern industrial systems. This paper presents a 3D Resilience State Space method to assess Communication-based train control (CBTC) system resilience under malware attack. We model the spread of malware as two functions: the communicability function $f$(x) and the susceptibility function 9 (x). We describe the characteristics of these two function in the CBTC complex network by using the percolation theory. Then we use a perturbation formalism to analyze the impact of malware attack on information flow and use it as an indicator of the cyber layer state. The CBTC cyber-physical system resilience metric formalizes as the system state transitions in three-dimensional state space. The three dimensions respectively represent the cyber layer state, the physical layer state, and the transmission layer state. The simulation results reveal that the proposed framework can effectively assess the resilience of the CBTC system. And the anti-malware programs can prevent the spread of malware and improve CBTC system resilience.","","978-1-7281-9142-3","10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564448","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9564448","","Fault tolerance;Three-dimensional displays;Simulation;Resists;Control systems;Malware;State-space methods","complex networks;computer network security;invasive software;railway communication;state-space methods","three-dimension resilience state space-based approach;passive defense methods;communication-based train control system resilience;cyber-physical system resilience metric formalizes;CBTC system resilience;anti-malware programs;transmission layer state;physical layer state;system state transitions;cyber layer state;CBTC complex network;susceptibility function;communicability function;malware attack;industrial systems;cyber attacks","","","","18","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the associated goals of an ultimate quality-of-service (QoS) that support real-time and mission-critical applications, along with utmost security and reliability, remain elusive. This paper describes a fundamental technological advance that not only attains ideal QoS with unique security and reliability capabilities but also supports full interworking with traditional IP networks, inasmuch as it does not require modification (e.g., labeling) or higher-layer/proprietary interpretation of IP packets. We describe an advanced wide-area network composed of traditional end-points, dual-mode switch/routers, and sequencing agents that provide per-flow admission and scheduling of packets on a link-by-link basis from source to destination. The network is fully scalable and can readily provide reachability across multiple domains that span the globe. Sequencing agents assure an individual, time-deterministic path for every critical application-i.e., those that require minimal transport delay (i.e., no packet queueing), no jitter and no packet loss. Moreover, since sequencing is accomplished on a per-flow basis and invokes a temporal paradigm for packet switching, we show that applications are completely immune to extraneous network influences, notably network congestion or Denial-of-Service attacks. As discussed in this paper, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment realization has demonstrated these attributes for both customary realtime flows (examples of which include voice- and video-over-IP) and sequenced TCP flows. The latter is especially significant, in that it makes possible for the first time a system for fully managed and guaranteed throughput of TCP data while maximizing goodput, a significant advance for reliable, deterministic, secure data transmission and networked storage. This paper further makes clear that traditional end-points (e.g., videoconferencing units and IP phones) can readily operate in packet-sequenced networks. Moreover, we note that the sequencing protocol permits per-flow reuse of preallocated-but unused-throughput. Consequently, nonsequenced packets (e.g., best-effort, asynchronous data) are ""backfilled"" and amenable to conventional routing in either sequenced networks or interconnected, conventional IP networks, thereby providing facile interworking with the large embedded base of legacy IP equipment.","","0-7803-8140-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2003.1290287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290287","","Wide area networks;Packet switching;IP networks;Switches;Web and internet services;Quality of service;Mission critical systems;Data security;Labeling;Delay","IP networks;packet switching;transport protocols;computer network management;computer network reliability;Internet;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic;quality of service","Internet;converged IP infrastructure;quality-of-service;QoS;reliability;wide-area network;WAN;dual-mode switch;routers;packet switching;network congestion;denial-of-service;commercial-off-the-shelf;COTS equipment;TCP flows;secure data transmission;packet-sequenced networks;sequencing protocol","","1","","7","IEEE","4 May 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a novel methodology based on transfer learning is proposed for real-time post-contingency transient stability prediction to overcome the difficulties about the long training times of these classifiers. In the proposed method, first, a small dataset which contains only the three-phase fault contingencies for various operating points is selected to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier, and then, an additional dataset which involves two-phase-to-ground fault scenarios is used to update the trained CNN using the transfer learning approach instead of retraining the model from ground up.

DPI aims to identify various malware (including spam and viruses) by inspecting both the header and the payload of each packet and comparing it to a known set of patterns. DPI is often performed on the critical path of the packet processing, thus the overall performance of the security tools is dominated by the speed of DPI. The seminal algorithm of Aho-Corasick (AC) is the de facto standard for pattern matching in network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Basically, the AC algorithm constructs a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) for detecting all occurrences of a given set of patterns by processing the input in a single pass. The input is inspected symbol by symbol (usually each symbol is a byte), such that each symbol results in a state transition. Thus, in principle, the AC algorithm has deterministic performance, which does not depend on specific input and therefore is not vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks, making it very attractive to NIDS systems. In this paper we show that, when implementing the AC algorithm in software, this property does not hold, due to the fact that contemporary pattern sets induce very large DFAs that cannot be stored entirely in cache. We then propose a novel technique to compress the representation of the Aho-Corasick automaton, so it can fit in modern cache. We compare both the performance and the memory footprint of our technique to previously-proposed implementation, under various settings and pattern sets. Our results reveal the space-time tradeoffs of DPI. Specifically, we show that our compression technique reduces the memory footprint of the best prior-art algorithm by approximately 60%, while achieving comparable throughput.","2325-5560","978-1-4244-8456-0","10.1109/HPSR.2011.5985996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5985996","","Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Software algorithms;Encoding;Pattern matching;Software;Throughput","authorisation;computer networks;Internet","software-based deep;space-time tradeoffs;packet inspection;network intrusion detection;prevention systems;Web application firewalls;DPI;packet processing;deterministic finite automaton;state transition;algorithmic complexity attacks;NIDS systems;AC algorithm;Aho-Corasick automaton;compression technique","","14","2","25","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike a traditional point sensor, this type of sensor has a rectangular sensing region with a processor installed on it to do processing and communication. Like wireless sensor networks with point sensors, energy-efficient communication is still an important issue in wireless sensor networks with cable sensors because of the need to efficiently use limited resources. To address the issue, we propose a Cable Mode Transition (CMT) algorithm, which determines the minimal number of active sensors to maintain K-coverage of a terrain as well as K-connectivity of the network. Specifically, it allocates periods of inactivity for cable sensors without affecting the coverage and connectivity requirements of the network based only on local information. Before presenting CMT, we first show the relationship between coverage and connectivity, then the eligibility algorithm permitting a cable sensor to decide whether to stay active. CMT calls the eligibility algorithm to schedule cables. Simulation results show that our scheme is efficient in saving energy and thus can prolong the lifetime of wireless cable sensor networks.","1938-1883","978-1-61284-233-2","10.1109/icc.2011.5963077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963077","","Communication cables;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;IEEE Communications Society;Communication system security;Optical sensors","optical cables;wireless sensor networks","energy-efficient communication scheme;wireless cable sensor network;WSN;fiber optic cable sensor;rectangular sensing region;cable mode transition;CMT algorithm;k-coverage;k-connectivity;eligibility algorithm","","3","","6","IEEE","28 Jul 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of these limitations, mainstream consensus approaches are unsuitable for low-resource applications such as IoT. As a result, this paper introduces a new consensus protocol known as “Delegated Proof of Accessibility” (DPoAC). The DPoAC protocol minimized the computational resource needs and energy usage demands of the existing proof-based consensus mechanisms, making it appropriate to use in applications with limited resources, such the Internet of Things.

Recent research has demonstrated the vulnerability of some feedback-control based applications to low-rate denial-of-service (LRDoS) attacks, which send high-intensity requests in an ON/OFF pattern to degrade the victim's performance and evade the detection designed for traditional DoS attacks. However, the intricate interaction between LRDoS attacks and the feedback control mechanism remains largely unknown. In this paper, we address two fundamental questions: 1) what is the impact of an LRDoS attack on a general feedback-control based system and 2) how to conduct a systematic evaluation of the impact of an LRDoS attack on specific feedback-control based systems. To tackle these problems, we model the system under attack as a switched system and then examine its properties. We conduct the first theoretical investigation on the impact of the LRDoS attack on a general feedback control system. We formally show that the attack can make the system's steady-state error oscillate along with the attack period, and prove the existence of LRDoS attacks that can force the system to be far off the desired state. In addition, we propose a novel methodology to systematically characterize the impact of an LRDoS attack on specific systems, and apply it to a web server and an IBM Notes server. This investigation obtains many new insights, such as new attack scenarios, the bound of the system's states, the relationship between the bound and the LRDoS attacks, the close-formed equations for quantifying the impact, and so on. The extensive experimental results are congruent with the theoretical analysis.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2013.2291970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6670771","Feedback control;low-rate DoS attack;switched system;stability;performance degradation","Web servers;Feedback control;Switched systems;Steady-state;Switches;Computer crime","computer network security;Internet;quality of service","Internet services;low-rate DoS attacks;quality-of-service aware applications;low-rate denial-of-service;LRDoS attacks;feedback control mechanism;switched system;IBM Notes server;Web server","","33","","52","IEEE","20 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Enhancing Power System Operational Resilience Against Wildfires","M. Abdelmalak; M.

Though various methods have been applied to enhance power grid resilience against severe weather events, only a few have focused on wildfires. Most previous operational-based resilience enhancement methods have focused on corrective or restorative strategies during and after extreme events without proactively preparing the system for forecasted potential failures. Also, the propagation behavior of wildfires among system components induces further complexities resulting in a mathematically involved problem accompanied with many modeling challenges. During sequential failures, operators need to make decisions in a fast-paced manner to maintain reliable operation and avoid cascading failures and blackouts. Thereby, the complexity of decision processes increases dramatically during extreme weather events. This article proposes a probabilistic proactive generation redispatch strategy to enhance the operational resilience of power grids during wildfires. A Markov decision process is used to model system state transitions and to provide generation redispatch strategies for each possible system state given component failure probabilities, wildfire spatiotemporal properties, and load variation. For a realistic system representation, dynamic system constraints are considered including ramping rates and minimum up/down times of generating units, load demand profile, and transmission constraints. The IBM ILOG CPLEX optimization studio is utilized to solve the optimization problem. The IEEE 30-bus system is used to validate the proposed strategy under various impact scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing the resilience level of power grids during wildfires.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2022.3145765","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:NSF1847578); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9693217","Extreme weather events;generation redispatch;Markov decision process (MDP);resilience;wildfires","Resilience;Costs;Generators;Markov processes;Power systems;Probabilistic logic;Meteorology","failure analysis;integer programming;linear programming;Markov processes;power generation dispatch;power generation reliability;power grids;power system security;probability","enhancing power system operational resilience;wildfires;power grids;power grid resilience;severe weather events;resilience enhancement methods;corrective strategies;restorative strategies;forecasted potential failures;system components;sequential failures;cascading failures;blackouts;extreme weather events;probabilistic proactive generation;Markov decision process;system state transitions;possible system state given component failure probabilities;wildfire spatiotemporal properties;realistic system representation;dynamic system constraints;IEEE 30-bus system;resilience level","","4","","45","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The limited power point tracking refers to controlling the power output of a photovoltaic array at a level below the maximum power point. The limited power point tracking exhibits advantages over maximum power point tracking (MPPT) both in terms of economy and system security. The previously reported LPPT methods, however, exhibit more oscillations at low power levels or require additional mode changing action under power scarcity and may malfunction under the rapidly varying environmental conditions. To avoid those difficulties, two novel LPPT control schemes are proposed. Both the schemes are carefully designed with minimum deviation from the traditional MPPT control so as to ensure easy implementation. Each of the controllers proposed has its own merit. The LPPT control under the proposed schemes can be implemented without the support of any local energy storage. Detailed case studies are performed to verify the effectiveness of proposed LPPT controllers.","","978-1-5090-3892-3","10.1109/CICPS.2015.7974075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7974075","Incremental conductance method;limited power point tracking;maximum power point tracking;perturb and observe method;photovoltaic system","Photovoltaic systems;Voltage control;Maximum power point trackers;Generators;Convergence;Oscillators","maximum power point trackers;photovoltaic power systems;power system economics;power system security;voltage control","photovoltaic plant;voltage-controlled DC bus;limited power point tracking;LPPT methods;photovoltaic array;maximum power point tracking;MPPT;power system economy;power system security","","5","","14","IEEE","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A distinction between left pectoral unipolar and bipolar pacemaker electrodes has been made here. Furthermore the different positions of a bipolar electrode were taken into consideration. It was found that depending on the position of the bipolar electrodes in a homogeneous magnetic field, major differences of induced voltage occur. The main task of this project is to ascertain the influence of electric conductivity on interference voltage in bipolar electrodes. The measurement circuit has been placed into an original pacemaker case and therefore allowed the comparison between bipolar and unipolar electrodes by only mode switching. The magnetic field has been generated by a Helmholtz coil. Part of the Helmholtz coil system was a model of a human torso filled with saline solution to simulate human tissue. The result of the measurements showed a dependency between electric conductivity and induced voltage.

By collecting the status of each switch through the Southbound, SDN provides a global view for the controller to attain flexible packet forwarding by a proactive mode or a reactive mode. However, a proactive mode is not suitable for highly dynamic networks and reactive mode needs to take a while termed as control delay from the collection state to the start of schedule. In large-scale and dynamic networks, control delay can cause network congestion when the network state changes more severely with high loads. In this paper, an M/D/1 queuing model is proposed to analyze the influence of this control delay, and then deep learning methods combining the advantages of proactive mode and reactive mode are adopted to predict the traffic to manage the traffic routing in advance. To reduce the prediction inaccuracy caused by the randomness and suddenness of traffic, we modify the loss function in deep learning models considering the time correlation and spatial correlation of traffic sequences and this proposed method has the potential to effectively reduce the predicted root mean square error (RMSE) by over 30%. Next, according to the predicted results, we propose a method of adjusting routing paths in advance in SDN to balance the load of overlapping links. Finally, simulation results show that using a deep learning method with a modified loss function can effectively reduce the average end-to-end delay by over 10% under a high load.","2769-3899","979-8-3503-1125-9","10.1109/ICPS58381.2023.10128099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128099","Software-Defined Networking (SDN);deep learning;traffic prediction","Deep learning;Analytical models;Correlation;Switches;Predictive models;Control systems;Routing","computer network security;deep learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;queueing theory;software defined networking;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","average end-to-end delay;collection state;control delay;data planes;deep learning method;deep learning models;flexible packet forwarding;highly dynamic networks;modified loss function;network congestion;network control;network state changes;optimize routing paths;predicted root mean square error;prediction inaccuracy;proactive mode;reactive mode;SDN;Software-Defined Networking;traffic prediction;traffic routing;traffic sequences","","","","22","IEEE","24 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To maintain the availability of the control system, the availability of anomaly detection itself is important. This paper considers a third-party monitoring system with multiple anomaly detection functions. The third monitoring system devotes control systems to control operations instated of security operations. Also, when a control system is subjected to a high-level cyberattack which loses control and security functions, it is expected that the multiple detection functions allow the operator to detect the abnormality earlier. Our proposed system uses two redundant PLCs for sequence control, and one of them is for normal operation, and the other one is for anomaly detection. They operate in conjunction, and when the cyberattacked PLC deviates from the normal operation, the anomaly detection PLC turns on the LED to make it easier to recognize visually, and determines that it is an anomaly. The cyberattack detection method is that the anomaly detection PLC always holds the normal state transition information of the control PLC, and the former PLC always monitors that of the latter PLC. Only when an abnormality occurs, the former PLC detects it as an abnormality. The display method of the detection way is shown by using three types of LEDs. By LEDs turning on or off, the operator can recognize which status is abnormal. The LED lighting state is shown in the state transition diagram, and we explain the superiority of the third-party monitoring system incorporating multiple detection methods.","2474-2325","978-1-7281-6667-4","10.1109/SII46433.2020.9026265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9026265","","Anomaly detection;Control systems;Clocks;Monitoring;Manipulators;Light emitting diodes","control engineering computing;industrial control;Internet;programmable controllers;security of data","security functions;multiple detection functions;sequence control;normal operation;anomaly detection PLC;cyberattack detection method;secured control;industrial control systems;industrial controllers;programmable logic controllers;control system;multiple anomaly detection functions;security operations;third-party monitoring system","","3","","10","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Users can employ the same interface to invoke various applications from the Internet. For security purposes, service providers would control the access to the provided interface through policy enforcement. Yet the access control of REST interfaces lacks a uniform standard regarding the policy language and corresponding enforcement implementation, which brings two limitations: i) Users have to deal with totally different types of policies to accommodate certain systems. ii) Service providers have to design their own platform-specific authorization policy language and the related enforcement mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a REST Policy Language (RestPL) to express the authorization policies especially for REST APIs. RestPL is ensured to be request-oriented, based on our definition of the standard request form. This indicates that a RestPL policy can be automatically generated from an actual request, which helps mitigate a user's pressure during policy designing. Furthermore, we also provide a reference implementation for the enforcement code of RestPL based on regular expressions and deploy it on OpenStack Liberty to demonstrate its feasibility. The experimental results indicate the enforcement overhead of RestPL can be reduced to 80.6% compared with the original policy. In addition, we show that an end-user can also benefit from RestPL for reducing the learning effort by at least 41.6%.","","978-1-5090-2675-3","10.1109/ICWS.2016.92","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7558065","representational state transfer;access control;security policy;request-oriented","Cloud computing;Standards;Authorization;Grammar","application program interfaces;authorisation;formal languages;Web services","RestPL;request-oriented policy language;RESTful API;Web applications;cloud computing systems;representational state transfer;Internet;security purposes;service providers;access control;policy enforcement;REST interfaces;authorization policy language;REST policy language;regular expressions;OpenStack Liberty","","5","","18","IEEE","1 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These protocols are expected to guarantee security, speed, low latency, less power consumption, reliability and efficient transfer of information between the devices. There are several application layer protocols available like Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket, Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Representational State Transfer (RESTFUL Services) and Data Distribution Services (DDS) that are employed in practice. The suitable protocol is selected based on the nature and requirements of the IoT system. However there are no standard guidelines in deciding a particular protocol for the IoT application. There is always uncertainty in deciding the application protocol suitable for the IoT requirements. Thereby, it is inevitable to know the strengths and weakness of the widely accepted protocols to determine the best-fit scenarios. Amongst these CoAP and MQTT are the most diffused protocols in the IoT landscape. This paper surveys five established protocols – CoAP, MQTT, Websocket, XMPP and AMQP. It discusses the origin of these protocols, the general characteristics, advantages and limitations. Furthermore, the paper does an in-depth comparative analysis of the protocols against the suitability of application areas. Additionally, the paper also explains the standard implementation architecture of the protocols.

The design leads to not necessarily $T$-functions as state transition functions of the automata involved in the ciphering and deciphering sides.

Hardware design obfuscation is a promising countermeasure to resist reverse engineering attacks and IP piracy. The majority of existing hardware obfuscation methods modify the original finite state machine (FSM) by adding additional state transitions and utilizing a key sequence to lock the transition from the nonfunctional states to the functional reset state. Those methods are effective to prevent attackers from entering the normal functional mode but they lack resilience if the FSM is already in the normal mode. This paper proposes to protect all the states with a low-cost state-deflection-based obfuscation method, which dynamically deflects state transitions from the original transition path to a black hole cluster if a wrong key is applied. Unlike other works that use static transitions between legal states to black hole states at the design time, this method utilizes a state rotation function (Rotatefunc) and selective register flipping function (Mapfunc) to dynamically control the state deflection paths. Hence, the difficulty of reverse engineering and thwarting register overwrite attacks is increased. Simulations performed on ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits show that the proposed method significantly reduces the difference of the net toggle activities between the correct and wrong key scenarios, and achieves up to 56% higher code coverage than the most efficient obfuscation method. Thanks to the dynamic deflection feature, on average, this method generates about 100 more unique state register patterns than other methods with moderate power increase. Moreover, the proposed method achieves the Hamming distance of primary outputs and state registers close to 50%.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2017.2697960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7911190","Design obfuscation;gate-level netlist;hardware security;intellectual property (IP) piracy;reverse engineering;state deflection","Registers;Hardware;IP networks;Security;Hamming distance;Logic gates;Reverse engineering","finite state machines;flip-flops;integrated circuit design;invasive software","novel dynamic state-deflection method;gate-level design;emerging security threats;integrated circuit supply chain;chip integrity;hardware intellectual property piracy;hardware design obfuscation;reverse engineering attacks;hardware obfuscation methods;original finite state machine;FSM;key sequence;nonfunctional states;functional reset state;normal functional mode;low-cost state-deflection;original transition path;black hole cluster;static transitions;legal states;black hole states;design time;state deflection paths;dynamic deflection feature;primary outputs;state transitions;benchmark circuits;selective register flipping function;unique state register patterns;register overwrite attacks;state rotation function","","45","","29","IEEE","25 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, in the normal state of the system, it is important to study the state transition and its harm to the system through security analysis. Besides, adopting certain control measures to reduce the risk of the system, such as the coordination of prevention and emergency control, is of great significance to both the safety and the economy of the system. In this premise, this paper proposes a risk-based two-layer optimization model for coordination on prevention control and emergency control of quasi-steady state AC-DC system. By introducing a continuous derivable function, the non-derivable constraints in the traditional model are replaced by continuous derivable constraints. The method can greatly improve the computational efficiency of the model. According to the characteristic of the two-layer optimization model, the first layer optimization problem is solved by the golden section method, and the second layer optimization problem is solved by the active and reactive power alternating approach method.

By introducing the maximum entropy (MaxENT) models into the rule optimization for the Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model, this paper proposes an improved BLP model with the self-learning function: MaxENT-BLP. This model first formalizes the security properties, system states, transformational rules, and a constraint model based on the states transition of the MaxENT. After handling the historical system access logs as the original data sets, this model extracts the user requests, current states, and decisions to act as the feature vectors. Second, we use k -fold cross validation to divide all vectors into a training set and a testing set. In this paper, the model training process is based on the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. And this model contains a strategy update algorithm to adjust the access control rules dynamically according to the access and decision records in a system. Third, we prove that MaxENT-BLP is secure through theoretical analysis. By estimating the precision, recall, and F1-score, the experiments show the availability and accuracy of this model.

However, Ajax techniques that enable better web experiences also make it fairly challenging to model Ajax application behaviors in the complex browser environment. In Ajax applications, server-side states are no longer synchronous with the views to end users at the client side. Therefore, to model the behaviors of Ajax applications, it is indispensable to incorporate client-side application states into the behavior models, as being explored by prior work. Unfortunately, how to leverage behavior models to perform security diagnosis in Ajax applications has yet been thoroughly examined. Existing models extracted from Ajax application behaviors are insufficient in a security context. In this paper, we propose a new behavior model for diagnosing attacks in Ajax applications, which abstracts both client-side state transitions as well as their communications to external servers. Our model articulates different states with the browser events or user actions that trigger state transitions. With a prototype implementation, we demonstrate that the proposed model is effective in attack diagnosis for real-world Ajax applications.","","978-0-7695-5007-7","10.1109/ICECCS.2013.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6601822","","Electronic mail;Browsers;Security;Context;Web servers;Load modeling","Internet;online front-ends;security of data","comprehensive client-side behavior model;real-world Ajax applications;complex Web-based systems;complex browser environment;security incident diagnosis;external servers;browser events;user actions;state transitions;prototype implementation;attack diagnosis","","9","","41","IEEE","19 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These systems are commonly used for the security purposes but are increasingly being used in a variety of other applications such as residential security, voter verification, banking using ATM. Changes in facial expression become a difficult task in recognizing faces. In this paper continuous naturalistic affective expressions will be recognized using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework. Active Appearance Model (AAM) landmarks are considered for each frame of the videos. The AAMs were used to track the face and extract its visual features. There are six different facial expressions considered over here: Happy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Fear and Sad. Different Expression recognition problem is solved through a multistage automatic pattern recognition system where the temporal relationships are modeled through the HMM framework. Dimension levels (i.e., labels) can be defined as the hidden states sequences in the HMM framework. Then the probabilities of these hidden states and their state transitions can be accurately computed from the labels of the training set. Through a three stage classification approach, the output of a first-stage classification is used as observation sequences for a second stage classification, modeled as a HMM-based framework. The k-NN will be used for the first stage classification. A third classification stage, a decision fusion tool, is then used to boost overall performance.","","978-1-4799-2320-5","10.1109/ECS.2014.6892800","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6892800","Hidden Markov model (HMM);K Nearest Neighbor (k-NN);Active Appearance Model (AAM);Dimension levels","Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling;Face recognition;Speech recognition;Active appearance model;Support vector machine classification;Speech","biometrics (access control);face recognition;hidden Markov models","hidden states;state transitions;AAM landmarks;active appearance model;HMM framework;ATM;banking;voter verification;residential security;digital image;biometric software application;Hidden Markov Model;automatic human facial expression recognition","","5","","23","IEEE","8 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electric power dispatch systems, management information systems, customer relation systems and so on, are all built on this infrastructure. It is an important task for network administrators of electric power industry to monitor, control and manage electric power information networks. Through installing safeguards, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems and anti-virus systems, the reliability of Electric Power Information Networks has been improved to a certain extent. However, threats also exist due to the loss of comprehensive understanding about network vulnerability. System methods should be employed to the vulnerability research of electric power information networks. Modeling Electric Power Information Network vulnerability and finding network flaws become more and more critical. A network intruder will take a series of actions to achieve a certain goal, and each action will change the state of a network. Thereby attack trees can be used to model the vulnerability of a network. An attack tree can be viewed as a directed tree where vertices represent network states and edges represent actions that lead state transitions. Root vertex is a certain goal. Any path from a leaf vertex to the root vertex is a whole attack pattern violating the security property of a network. A node of an attack tree can be decomposed as a set of attack sub-goals, either all of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed, or any one of which must be achieved for the attack to succeed. So there are two decomposition operations in an attack tree: AND and OR. Formal logic can be applied to attack analysis. Thus we can model attacks for network vulnerability analysis. This modeling method has two major advantages. At first it can be used to analyze the flaws of a network and find unknown flaws. Secondly network administrators use it to handle flaws rationally under the limits of the finite resources. Electric power information networks are generally made up of production control networks, enterprise management networks and external networks. They are connected and form a complex network. It is necessary to comprehend and analyze its vulnerability. An information network of an electric power plant is illustrated, and attack modeling is used to analyze its vulnerability. Industry control computers can manipulate electric devices. It is vital to guarantee industry control computers. Hence the goal is set to obtain the administrator right of an industry control computer. An attack tree is constructed tolocate the flaws of the network. Some advices to network security administrators are given. It is an attempt to formulate the security administration of electric power information networks using attack trees. Faulty Tree Method (FTM) has been used to analysis the reliability of power systems. Attack tree can help integrate the reliability analysis of the hybrid system consisting of an electric power system and an electric power information network system.","","978-1-4244-5940-7","10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5666152","Electric power information network;attack tree;vulnerability;network security","Servers;Computational modeling;Monitoring;Analytical models;Security;Fires","directed graphs;fault trees;formal logic;load dispatching;power system reliability;power system simulation;security of data;trees (mathematics)","electric power information networks;attack modeling;electric power system;electric power dispatch system;management information system;customer relation system;safeguard;directed tree;root vertex;formal logic;network vulnerability analysis;enterprise management networks;production control networks;industry control computer;network security administrators;faulty tree method;FTM;power system reliability;power system analysis","","","","15","IEEE","13 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Coordinated evolution of the various elements of a decentralized system may be difficult, if not impossible, as individual organizations evolve their service offerings in response to organization- and service-specific pressures, including market demand, technology, competitive and cooperative interests, and funding. Consequently, decentralized services offer unique challenges for evolution and adaptation that reach well beyond any one single organizational boundary. However, client-driven service customization and tailoring is a powerful tool for meeting conflicting, independent client demands in an environment where disorderly and uneven service evolution predominates. To this end, we contribute an architectural style, COmputAtional State Transfer (COAST), designed to provide extensive, safe, and secure client-directed customization of decentralized services.

Petri net as an important formal tool for modeling, analysis and analysis of distributed, parallel and real-time systems provides a solid foundation for CPS modeling. However, Petri nets lack the ability to describe spatial information, so it is impossible to fully model CPS. Incorrect system modeling can directly affect system reliability and even life-threatening and property safety, Therefore, when modeling and analyzing CPS characteristics, a more complete modeling method is needed. This paper extends the Defect extension time Petri net and constructs a spatiotemporal Petri net that can describe the positional changes of CPS physical entities. This paper also analyzes the physical characteristics of CPS in detail, starting from the classification and characteristics of physical entities, and deeply studying the properties of CPS physical entities and their location transition process. Proposing a formal modeling method for CPS physical entities; Introducing spatial factors on the basis of Petri nets by analyzing the characteristics that Petri nets must satisfy, getting the formal definition of Petri net, It can not only describe the physical entity logic and time-level behavior, but also describe the state changes caused by physical entity location changes.Firstly, using petri net to finely model important equipment in information systems, and then based on these models and the attack source delivery path, establishing the fine Bayesian cyber attack model.

The MQ codebook comprises four sub-codebooks based on the classification of the state transitions. Instead of coding the absolute gain level, only the difference between the input gain and the average gain for the quantisation template is transmitted. For the pitch quantizer, the direction of pitch change is coded rather than the actual pitch value. All the quantisation levels are gray coded which improves robustness. The performances in term of objective measures which show the merits of employing Gray-coding into the quantized speech parameters are given.

Communications via RF signals are generally reliable and well understood but cannot support emerging data rate needs unless they use a large portion of the precious radio spectrum. FSO communications offer enormous data rates but operate much more at the mercy of the environment. The perennial limitations of FSO communications are manifested in the channel attributes of scintillation (optical turbulence) and path obscurations. Both phenomena reduce the availability of the optical channel to support reliable communications. To design transmission techniques that operate optimally in channel obscurants, a good understanding of the channel behavior is necessary. In most prior works, Monte-Carlo ray tracing (MCRT) algorithm has been used to estimate channel parameters. This task is quite numerically intensive. The focus of this paper is on investigating the possibility of simplifying this task by a direct introduction of state transition matrices associated with standard Markov modeling into the MCRT computer simulations programs. We show that by tracing a photonpsilas trajectory in space via a Markov chain model, the angular distribution can be calculated via simple matrix multiplications. We also demonstrate that the new approach produces results that are close to those obtained by MCRT and other known methods. The value of the proposed method lies in its simplicity and numeric efficiency compared to the computationally intensive MCRT.","2155-7586","978-1-4244-2676-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753359","Angular dispersion;channel modeling;Markov chain;Monte-Carlo ray tracing;scattering","Atmospheric modeling;Laser modes;Optical scattering;Communication system security;Ray tracing;Space technology;Bit rate;Radio frequency;Optical sensors;Military computing","broadband networks;laser beam applications;Markov processes;military communication;Monte Carlo methods;optical communication;telecommunication network reliability","Markov chain;atmospheric channel modeling;free space laser communications;free space optical communications;broadband applications;FSO communications;scintillation;optical turbulence;path obscurations;reliable communications;state transition matrices;Monte-Carlo ray tracing algorithm;military operations","","4","","13","IEEE","19 Jan 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are certain attacks like ARP spoofing, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) error message based attacks etc. for which passive monitoring schemes have several limitations because in such attacks there is no change in sequence of events.

Its novel callback mechanism and virtual network device connection capability cost-effectively enhance user controlled testing intelligence for verifying protocols with complicated state transitions. The PDU generator aims to provide a systematic solution for rapid test case creation, which is based on new strengthened BNF (Backus-Naur form) language for protocol specification mutation and fault injection.

Specifically, false data injection attacks aim at tampering with the sensed data that reflect the normal system operation state. Therefore, a time-efficient and accurate approach to assessing sensor trustworthiness is necessary. To this end, we propose T-LHDM (a trust model based on low and high decision-making processes), a sensor state trust model based on a Markov chain to represent sensor state transitions in normal operating conditions. To demonstrate the model, we first observed sensed data in a hierarchical decision-making process by intentionally exploiting the sensor data’s temporal and spatial correlations. Then, the consistency between the precomputed set of sensor state transitions and the observed ones was used to detect corruptions and assess the sensor trustworthiness. Our experiments using two real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed model accurately assessed the sensor trustworthiness with an average accuracy of 95%. We also stress the significance of considering the sensor’s spatiotemporal correlations to assess the trust of the sensed data, which has been neglected in previous studies. To this end, we conducted a comparative evaluation against a contemporary temporal correlation-based method and three well-known correlation tests. The results showed that T-LHDM outperformed all the competing methods.","2641-810X","978-1-6654-7402-3","10.1109/EDCC57035.2022.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9933141","Sensor correlations;False data attack;IoT","Correlation;Systems operation;Decision making;Markov processes;Data models;Spatial databases;Spatiotemporal phenomena","computer crime;decision making;Internet of Things;Markov processes;security of data;telecommunication security","sensed data;contemporary temporal correlation-based method;trust assessment model;hierarchical decision-making process;IoT sensor networks;IoT devices;false data injection attacks;normal system operation state;low decision-making processes;high decision-making processes;sensor state trust model;sensor state transitions;sensor data;T-LHDM;Markov chain;real-world datasets","","","","27","IEEE","2 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, when the inter-domain routing system faces security incidents such as disasters and attacks, it is easy to cause the continuous propagation of link failures, resulting in a large-scale network disconnection and posing a considerable threat to the security of the Internet. The previous research mainly aims to enhance the protocol's safety, cannot change the original failure propagation mechanism, and cannot fundamentally solve cascading failure propagation. In response to this problem, this paper introduces SDN and proposes RSM-PA. This method perceives the available path topology by sharing the link state information in the region, provides a verification mechanism for the availability of the route in the routing process to avoid the link failure in the region due to overload. The comparison of routing results before and after the link state changes under the same experimental conditions shows that RSM-PA can effectively adjust the routing strategy according to the path availability, and lay a solid foundation for suppressing the propagation of cascading failures.","","978-1-6654-9457-1","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00075","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61502528,61402525); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781081","Inter-domain Routing System;Software-defined Networking;Route Selection","Network topology;Heuristic algorithms;Power system protection;Routing;Real-time systems;Routing protocols;Internet","computer network security;routing protocols;software defined networking;telecommunication network topology","route selection method;inter-domain routing system;path availability;routing selection process;link failure;original failure propagation mechanism;link state information;routing process;link state;routing strategy;RSM-PA","","","","22","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different from previous approaches, the proposed method accurately evaluates the annual cost and benefits obtainable by FACTS devices installation by formulating a large-scale optimization problem that contains power flow analyses for a large number of system states representing annual power system operations. In addition, dynamic state transitions caused by specified contingencies are also simulated in the optimization problem to evaluate the effect of FACTS control actions as well as the other coordinated controls. The expected cost consists of operating cost under normal and contingency states along with their related probabilities to occur. Maximizing social welfare is the objective for normal state while minimizing compensations for generations re-scheduling and load shedding as well as maximizing social welfare are the objectives in case of contingency.

To use SCR effectively for critical applications, automated verification of safety properties is important. The fact that model checking approaches are sometimes problematic motivates us to further examine the alternative approach of theorem proving. Theorem proving, in general, is a difficult task; however the regular structure of the proof obligations generated from SCR specifications suggests that relatively unsophisticated theorem provers can discharge many of these obligations. As a feasibility study, we use the B-Toolkit to detect safety violations in an example SCR specification. The B-Toolkit is a good choice because it is commercially available and Supports verified refinement to executables in a commercial programming language (C). We convert the mode transition table in the example SCR specification to an AMN (Abstract Machine Notation) specification and analyze the result with the B-Toolkit. The B-Toolkit generates 120 proof obligations of which 113 are automatically discharged by the theorem prover. The remaining 7 proof obligations are, in fact, not theorems and correspond to the 3 problems in the SCR specification detected by the model checking approaches. For the corrected SCR specification, the B-Toolkit automatically discharges all proof obligations. The example shows that even simple theorem provers are a viable approach to automated analysis for SCR specifications.","","0-7803-3979-7","10.1109/CMPASS.1997.613186","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=613186","","Safety;Thyristors;Application software;Software systems;Costs;Logic;Systems engineering and theory;Computer languages;Software tools;Security","formal specification;software tools;theorem proving","B-toolkit;SCR specifications;event-driven systems;Software Cost Reduction;specifications;theorem proving;safety violations;Abstract Machine Notation","","","","27","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, how to divide the administrative privileges remains a difficulty in practice. In this work, we simplify the privilege partitioning problem into a classification problem of RESTful functions, so the permission to call a category of functions can be granted to a specific administrator. We propose a RESTful API classification approach called RestSep based on genetic algorithm. A classification is represented as a 2-dimensional matrix, which is used as the chromosome. Customized operators of selection, mutation and crossover are designed. The fitness function is designed to balance parameters such as number of categories, test case coverage, function overlapping, etc. Experiments on popular clouds like OpenStack and Kubernetes indicate RestSep can generate a self-explanatory classification result, which can serve as a guideline for privilege partitioning. The overhead of test generation is at most 13.1% and the overhead of genetic algorithm is at most 183.29s, which are acceptable for practical use.","","978-1-5386-0752-7","10.1109/ICWS.2017.64","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029806","representational state transfer;privilege partition;genetic algorithm;integration test","Cloud computing;Genetic algorithms;Sociology;Statistics;Access control","application program interfaces;authorisation;cloud computing;genetic algorithms;matrix algebra;pattern classification","RestSep;test-oriented privilege partitioning approach;web applications;representational state transfer API;security purposes;service providers;administrative privileges;classification problem;RESTful functions;RESTful API classification approach;genetic algorithm;2-dimensional matrix;fitness function;test case coverage;function overlapping;self-explanatory classification result;test generation;cloud computing systems;mutation operator;crossover operator;access control;selection operator","","2","","23","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to low-resource and poor computing capability, these devices have a high number of firmware vulnerabilities. Software verification is a powerful solution to ensure the correctness and security of IoT firmware programs. Unfortunately, due to the complex semantics and syntax of program languages (typically C), applying software verification in IoT firmware faces the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. One of the fundamental reasons is that verification methods cannot support verifying state transitions on the memory space caused by pointer operations well. To this end, by combining sparse value flow (SVF) analysis into model checking and optimizing computational redundancy among them, we design a novel points-to-sensitive model checker, called PCHECKER, which can provide a highly precise and efficient verification for IoT firmware programs. We first design a spatial flow model to effectively describe state behaviors of a C program both on the symbolic and memory space. We then propose a counterexample-guided model checking algorithm that can dynamically refine abstract precisions and update nondeterministic points-to relations. With a set of C benchmarks containing a variety of pointer operations and other complex C features, our experiments have shown that compared with state of the art (SOTA), PCHECKER can achieve outstanding results in the verification tasks of C programs that its verification accuracy is 95.9%, and its average verification time of each line of code is 1.27 ms, which are both better than existing model checkers.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3163383","Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2022JQ-611); Basic Research Programs of Taicang(grant numbers:TC2020JC03); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515110279); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:D5000210588); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745051","Model checking;pointer analysis;spare value flow analysis;software verification","Model checking;Computational modeling;Software;Internet of Things;Analytical models;Semantics;Security","C language;firmware;Internet of Things;program verification;storage management","C program;firmware vulnerabilities;software verification;IoT firmware programs;complex semantics;program languages;pointer operations;sparse value flow analysis;spatial flow model;nondeterministic points-to relations;state transition verification;points-to-sensitive model checker;counterexample-guided model checking;Internet of Things;memory space;SVF;computational redundancy;PCHECKER","","","","45","IEEE","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Delay-on-Miss technique is one such approach, which simply delays loads that miss in the L1 cache until they become non-speculative, resulting in no transient changes in the memory hierarchy. However, this costs performance, prompting the use of value prediction (VP) to regain some of the delay.However, the problem cannot be solved by simply introducing a new kind of speculation (value prediction). Value-predicted loads have to be validated, which cannot be commenced until the load becomes non-speculative. Thus, value-predicted loads occupy the same amount of precious core resources (e.g., reorder buffer entries) as Delay-on-Miss. The end result is that VP only yields marginal benefits over Delay-on-Miss.In this paper, our insight is that we can achieve the same goal as VP (increasing performance by providing the value of loads that miss) without incurring its negative side-effect (delaying the release of precious resources), if we can safely, non-speculatively, recompute a value in isolation (without being seen from the outside), so that we do not expose any information by transferring such a value via the memory hierarchy. Value Recomputation, which trades computation for data transfer was previously proposed in an entirely different context: to reduce energy-expensive data transfers in the memory hierarchy. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of value recomputation in relation to the Delay-on-Miss approach of hiding speculation, discuss the trade-offs, and show that we can achieve the same level of security, reaching 93% of the unsecured baseline performance (5% higher than Delay-on-miss), and exceeding (by 3%) what even an oracular (100% accuracy and coverage) value predictor could do.","","978-1-6654-2025-9","10.1109/SEED51797.2021.00021","European Commission; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604354","security;microarchitecture;recomputation;speculation","Microarchitecture;Costs;Side-channel attacks;Data transfer;Software;Delays;Security","cache storage;computer architecture;cryptography","value recomputation;speculative side-channel attacks;microarchitectural state changes;Delay-on-Miss technique;memory hierarchy;value prediction;VP;value-predicted loads;invisible speculation performance;L1 cache","","","","51","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in such inherent low-inertia systems, randomness and fluctuation of the output power of RESs and uncertain load consumption can easily incur dynamic stability issues, such as transient power impact, unacceptable frequency deviations, and operation mode transitions for security. To solve the above problems and enhance the dynamic stability of the system, an enhanced dynamic stability control (EDSC) scheme with locally measured signals only is proposed in this paper. In this control scheme, the bi-directional interlinking dc-ac converter uses the ac frequency in ac MG as the reference value of dc voltage and adopts the current feedforward control to control the dc voltage in the dc MG to be consistent with the ac frequency. By electrically coupling dc voltage and ac frequency, power disturbances in ac or dc sides will cause almost identical variation degrees in both ac frequency and dc voltage. Under the proposed EDSC scheme, the distributed ESSs in both ac and dc sides are then automatically coordinated and controlled by the unified droop control to balance transient power disturbances and smooth output of diesel generator under normal condition, which can effectively improve stability and controllability of such low-inertia systems. Furthermore, in an emergency such as failure of diesel generator, the operation mode can be switched seamlessly with the proposed EDSC scheme. The detailed theoretical analysis including control system design, small signal model analysis of key parameter influence on system dynamics, and simulation verifications in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment is presented to verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed EDSC scheme.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2926814","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51807135); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8755829","Low-inertia hybrid ac/dc microgrids;distributed energy storage systems;enhanced dynamic stability control;transient power sharing;seamless transition","Generators;Power system stability;Frequency control;Voltage control;Transient analysis;Hybrid power systems;Stability analysis","control system synthesis;controllability;DC-AC power convertors;distributed power generation;electric current control;energy storage;feedforward;hybrid power systems;power generation control;power generation reliability;power system CAD;power system stability;renewable energy sources;voltage control","distributed energy storage systems;isolated remote areas;islands;power supply reliability;enhanced dynamic stability control scheme;bi-directional interlinking dc-ac converter;ac frequency;current feedforward control;EDSC scheme;distributed ESSs;unified droop control;transient power disturbances;controllability;system dynamics;diesel generators;dc voltage control;control system design;low-inertia hybrid ac-dc microgrid;renewable energy sources-based distributed generators;RES;uncertain load consumption;ac-dc MG;small signal model analysis;PSCAD-EMTDC environment","","43","","24","CCBY","5 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since they contain sensitive information, whole collected data should be stored in a platform that guarantee both data confidentiality and integrity. In this sense, permissioned blockchain i.e. Hyperledger can be seen as an auspicious candidate for providing a secure yet scalable storage platform thanks to its data integrity and peers decentralization features. Considering that both IoT and blockchain network have different working mechanism, therefore, a software platform is required to provide an integration layer between the IoT and blockchain network. In this paper, we propose the design of IoT-to-Blockchain platform for integrating internet of things based smart healthcare system and blockchain network. The proposed system consists of five components including blcokchain-to-device interface, chain code execution interface, membership service provider (MSP), peers node and ordering node. The proposed system consists of five components including HTTP-based API gateway as device-to-blockchain interface, membership service provider (MSP), peers node and orderer. At first, the API gateway receives sensing data from IoT gateway device. Upon reception, the API gateway acting as client invokes chain code installed in each blockchain peer by emitting a transaction proposal to peers. Peers then simulate the execution and send back the endorsed data to the client i.e. API gateway. Collected endorsement from various peers are sent to orderer which then build a block containing an ordered transactions received from all clients and then broadcast that block to all peers. Each peer the performs a final verification before committing all ordered transactions on that block into its own local ledger. By using this mechanism, every peer in network can receive similar transaction orders which lead to identical ledger state changes.","","978-1-7281-5163-2","10.1109/NICS48868.2019.9023797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9023797","","Logic gates;Peer-to-peer computing;Sensors;Internet of Things;Medical services;Cloud computing","application program interfaces;body area networks;computer network security;cryptography;data integrity;distributed databases;health care;Internet of Things;internetworking;medical information systems;transaction processing","blockchain peer;endorsed data;API gateway;ordered transactions;smart healthcare system;blockchain network;personal health data;wireless body area network;data confidentiality;permissioned blockchain;storage platform;data integrity;software platform;integration layer;blcokchain-to-device interface;chain code execution interface;membership service provider;peers node;ordering node;device-to-blockchain interface;sensing data;IoT gateway device;IoT-to-blockchain platform;Internet of Things;HTTP-based API gateway","","14","","8","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the fast processing speed of symmetric key encryption methods, due to the problem in key exchange, hybrid encryption solves the security problem of key exchange using asymmetric key method. The asymmetric-key method is difficult to provide smooth services due to the decrease in processing speed caused by computational complexity. The hybrid method is designed to take advantage of the fast processing speed of the symmetric-key, and the secure exchange method of the key used in the symmetric-key operates by using the asymmetric-key. However, with the advent of quantum computer technology, encryption techniques using the asymmetric-key method are changing in the same way as increasing the key size used. Therefore, we will explain the AI application method using the state change of Rubik’s cube to generate keys in the latest state in the symmetric-key encryption system. The application of the Rubik’s cube state change algorithm, which operates on the AI base described in this paper, has the advantage of inducing and using the used key without exchanging the pre-shared key. Because of this key induction method, malicious attackers have little information on the keys used for encryption and decryption, so it is judged that the confidentiality and integrity of key generation and management can be secured more safely. We intend to improve the problem of key exchange and management in existing encryption systems by generating and managing keys through the Rubik’s cube state change algorithm, which operates based on AI.","1976-7684","978-1-6654-6268-6","10.1109/ICOIN56518.2023.10048916","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10048916","Artificial intelligence;key generation;symmetric-key encryption method;cryptography;Information security","Web and internet services;Focusing;Receivers;Companies;Speech recognition;Encryption;Internet","artificial intelligence;computational complexity;cryptography","AI application method;asymmetric key method;hybrid symmetric key encryption methods;key exchange;key generation method;key induction method;key management method;pre-shared key;Rubik's cube state change algorithm;secure exchange method","","","","8","IEEE","22 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This new approach solves the communication reliability problems and addresses application security. This paper is a case study of 3 installed DTT systems that use cellular communication - one system at Central Virginia Electric Cooperative and two at Dominion Energy. In this paper the authors will report on the design, implementation, performance and issues encountered during and post project execution. These intelligent DTT systems have been designed to increase availability of the DG by preventing the indiscriminate disconnection of the sites. Traditionally Direct Transfer Trip Signals (DTT) has been sent between substations and remote Distributed Generation (DG) sites using leased telephone lines. If DTT communication is interrupted, the DTT system will disconnect the DG site. Leased copper lines are becoming less reliable, leading to unwanted disconnection of DG sites. Installation of fiber is not always feasible due to the cost. This paper will discuss an approach to provide DTT signals using wireless communications. The paper will address the security concerns that many Utilities might face. Two new innovations to increase the DG site's availability will be discussed. 1) Automatic Direct Transfer Close If system conditions return to normal after a DTT event, the system will automatically close the DG site back in onto the feeder. 2) Dynamic Feeder State change protection function. Using cellular or wireless communication systems it must be expected that there will be communication interruptions during normal maintenance actions. During these times the DG site device activates a new protection function that will detect any anomalies that could constitute a change in the connected feeder systems (e.g. caused by a fault or the opening of a breaker) and then only disconnect the DG site.","2474-9753","978-1-7281-4019-3","10.1109/CPRE.2019.8765861","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765861","","Substations;Reliability;Optical fiber communication;Optical fiber devices;Telephone sets;Wireless communication;Circuit faults","cellular radio;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","dynamic feeder state change protection function;automatic direct transfer;distributed generation;substations;intelligent direct transfer trip signal;Dominion Energy;intelligent DTT signal system;remote distributed generation sites;copper lines;telephone lines;communication reliability problems;connected feeder systems;DG site device;wireless communication systems;cellular communication systems;DTT communication;Central Virginia Electric Cooperative","","2","","2","IEEE","18 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A recursive sampling method is introduced in the proposed Monte Carlo-based framework for generating scenarios, in which the effects of component aging and covariates on the outage process are quantified by the proportional hazard model (PHM). For each sampled scenario, an iterative dynamic scenario updating approach is introduced to consider interactions among covariate conditions, random component outages, and maintenance outage scheduling. The co-optimization problem is decoupled into three separate optimization subproblems by Lagrangian relaxation (LR), which include generation maintenance scheduling, transmission maintenance scheduling, and short-term SCUC problems. Each scenario is dynamically updated based on the optimal maintenance outage and SCUC solutions, and maintenance and SCUC solutions are re-optimized using the updated scenario.

This paper investigates the benefits that a virtualization-based replication infrastructure can offer for implementing proactive recovery. Our approach uses the hypervisor to initialize a new replica in parallel to normal system execution and thus minimizes the time in which a proactive reboot interferes with system operation. As a consequence, the system maintains an equivalent degree of system availability without requiring more replicas than a traditional replication system. Furthermore, having the old replica available on the same physical host as the rejuvenated replica helps to optimize state transfer. The problem of remote transfer is reduced to remote validation of the state in the frequent case when the local replica has not been corrupted.","1060-9857","0-7695-2995-X","10.1109/SRDS.2007.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4365686","","Virtual machine monitors;Application software;Costs;Operating systems;Distributed computing;Large-scale systems;Computer networks;Communication networks;Communication system security;Computer security","distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;security of data","hypervisor-based efficient proactive recovery;intrusion tolerant systems;fault tolerant systems;virtualization-based replication infrastructure","","25","2","24","IEEE","29 Oct 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the inherent mechanical energy consumption and the long-range signal propagation pathloss, the traditional cruising and hovering UAV relay modes are deficient in energy utilization and secrecy rate, respectively. Modeling of the secrecy energy efficiency with respect to UAV mode adaptation is limited in the literature and deserves further investigation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secrecy rate-energy efficient UAV relay mode adaptation scheme for secure wireless communications scenarios where the eavesdropping locations are known, i.e., the eavesdropper is a hijacked internal legitimate node. In this secure system, the UAV cooperatively assists the legitimate transmissions and injects artificial interference to the eavesdropper. We investigate optimum UAV placement and relay period planning for the hovering and the cruising relay modes, respectively. By modeling the UAV modes transfer and maximizing the secrecy energy efficiency, the optimum mode adaptation ratios are obtained under both the secrecy rate-prioritized and the energy-saving criteria. In addition, the proposed UAV relay mode adaptation mechanism is further studied for each UAV task division, to adapt to the dynamic channel variations and enhance the security. Our theoretical analysis shows that the mode adaptation ratio is determined by the secrecy rate-energy gain between the cruising and the hovering modes, and by the energy consumption threshold of the UAV relays. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves higher secrecy energy efficiency than the traditional schemes.","2473-2400","","10.1109/TGCN.2023.3243394","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3904404,2020YFB1807003); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071250,62222107,62071223,62031012,62271399); Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by China Association for Science and Technology; Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China(grant numbers:20KJB510033); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2242022R40030); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2022KW-07); Erik Jonsson Distinguished Professorship at UT-Dalla; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040747","UAV;secrecy rate;energy efficiency;mode adaptation;relay","Autonomous aerial vehicles;Relays;Three-dimensional displays;Monitoring;Eavesdropping;Security;Wireless communication","artificial intelligence;autonomous aerial vehicles;energy conservation;energy consumption;mobile radio;optimisation;relay networks (telecommunication);telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless channels","artificial interference;artificial noise;cruising UAV relay modes;dynamic channel variations;eavesdroppers;eavesdropping locations;energy consumption threshold;energy utilization;energy-saving criteria;hijacked internal legitimate node;hovering UAV relay modes;inherent mechanical energy consumption;legitimate transmission;legitimate transmissions;long-range signal propagation pathloss;mode adaptation ratio;mode adaptive secure UAV relay transmissions;optimum mode adaptation ratios;optimum UAV placement;relay period;secrecy energy efficiency;secrecy rate improvement;secrecy rate-energy efficient UAV relay mode adaptation scheme;secrecy rate-energy gain;secrecy rate-prioritized criteria;secure system;secure wireless communications scenarios;security enhancement;UAV modes transfer;UAV relay mode adaptation mechanism;UAV task division;unmanned aerial vehicles;wireless transmission security enhancement","","","","27","IEEE","8 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This limit on the number of RegExes impairs the scalability of today's RegEx detection systems. The scalability of existing schemes is generally limited by the traditional detection paradigm based on per-character-state processing and state transition detection. The main focus of existing schemes is on optimizing the number of states and the required transitions, but not on optimizing the suboptimal character-based detection method. Furthermore, the potential benefits of allowing out-of-sequence detection, instead of detecting components of a RegEx in the order of appearance, have not been explored. Lastly, the existing schemes do not provide ways to adapt to the evolving RegExes. In this paper, we propose Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to perform scalable RegEx detection. LaFA requires less memory due to these three contributions: 1) providing specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilization; 2) systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce the number of concurrent operations; 3) sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. Here, we demonstrate that LaFA requires an order of magnitude less memory compared to today's state-of-the-art RegEx detection systems. Using LaFA, a single-commodity field programmable gate array (FPGA) chip can accommodate up to 25  000 (25 k) RegExes. Based on the throughput of our LaFA prototype on FPGA, we estimate that a 34-Gb/s throughput can be achieved.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2011.2181411","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134694","Deep packet inspection;DPI;LaFA;Lookahead Finite Automata;network intrusion detection and prevention system;NIDPS;regular expressions","Data structures;Doped fiber amplifiers;Complexity theory;Timing;Correlation;Automata;Memory management","computer network security;field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;inspection","scalable lookahead regular expression detection system;deep packet inspection;RegEx detection systems;state transition detection;per-character-state processing;suboptimal character-based detection method;lookahead finite automata;LaFA;single-commodity field programmable gate array;FPGA chip;network intrusion detection;bit rate 34 Gbit/s","","21","","34","IEEE","18 Jan 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, integration of intelligence and cyber systems into a power grid can lead to serious cyber security challenges and makes the overall system more vulnerable to cyber attacks. To address this challenging issue, this article presents defense mechanisms to either protect the system from attackers in advance or detect the existence of data injection attacks to improve the smart grid security. Focusing on signal processing techniques, this article introduces an adaptive scheme on detection of injected bad data at the control center. This scheme takes the power measurements of two sequential data collection slots into account, and detects data injection attacks by monitoring the measurement variations and state changes between the two time slots. The proposed scheme has the capability of adaptively detecting attacks including both non-stealthy attacks and stealthy attacks. Stealthy attacks are proved impossible to detect using conventional residual- based methods, and can cause more dangerous effects on power systems than non-stealthy attacks. It is demonstrated that the proposed scheme can also be used for attack classification to help system operators prioritize their actions to better protect their systems, and is therefore very valuable in practical smart grid systems.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2017.1700180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067689","","Transmission line measurements;Power measurement;Smart grids;Power transmission lines;Sensors;State estimation;Energy management;Internet of Things;Information exchange","energy conservation;energy consumption;power engineering computing;power measurement;power system measurement;power system security;security of data;signal processing;smart power grids","stealthy attacks;power systems;nonstealthy attacks;attack classification;system operators;defense mechanisms;data injection attacks;smart grid networks;intelligence;cyber systems;power grid;smart grid security;injected bad data;sequential data collection slots;bidirectional information exchange;energy consumption;energy efficiency;cyber security challenges;signal processing;control center;power measurements;measurement variations","","33","","15","IEEE","13 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

State estimation (SE) is one of fundamental components in smart grid that evaluates the operation state of a grid by using a set of sensor measurements and grid topologies. A major issue is the authenticity of the measurements collected by the sensors. Specifically, the false data injection attack (FDIA) aims to temper the information that reflect the grid operation state. In this paper, we propose an efficient prediction-based FDIA detection and location scheme, PDL, in which the state vector of smart grid can be represented as multivariate time series, and can be predicted by vector autoregressive processes (VAR) through intentionally exploiting the temporal and spatial correlations of states. Different from most previous works which assumed the state transfer matrix constant and diagonal, a time-varying and non-diagonal matrix is adopted in this scheme. Then, the consistency between the predicted measurements and the observed measurements is utilized to detect and locate abnormal data. Besides, the detected abnormal data can be replaced with the predicted data, which simplifies the calibration process. Extensive simulation results verify the performance of the proposed scheme.","0730-3157","978-1-5386-2667-2","10.1109/COMPSAC.2018.10317","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8377945","False data injection attack, state estimation, prediction, smart grid","Transmission line measurements;Current measurement;Smart grids;State estimation;Power measurement;Mathematical model;Covariance matrices","autoregressive processes;fault diagnosis;Internet of Things;matrix algebra;observers;power engineering computing;power system security;power system state estimation;security of data;smart power grids;time series","detected abnormal data;smart grid;complex cyber-physical systems;smart devices;state estimation;grid topologies;grid operation state;state vector;predicted measurements;power systems;prediction-based false data injection attack detection;prediction-based FDIA detection;state transfer matrix constant;time-varying nondiagonal matrix","","11","","17","IEEE","22 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Detection of such deceptive information obtained during online interactions (emails, chat room conversations) is the first step before counter strategies can be developed. With the large-scale use of information technologies as a general communication medium, facilitating deception detection is a key enabler to utilizing information systems to their fullest potential. This article presents a framework for computer-aided deception detection building on the interpersonal deception theory (IDT) of human interpersonal communication research and text-processing techniques for facilitating deception analysis of text-oriented communication. A state-transition diagram based framework is proposed to model the dynamic evolution of an interpersonal conversation between a sender and receiver based on the IDT-based process schemata. The framework is then utilized to develop a deception detection agent to process textual information. Deception detection is defined as a process of model verification.

Using the pattern dividing, the variety of target pattern lengths can be mitigated, so that memory usage in homogeneous string matchers can be efficient. In order to identify each original long pattern being divided, a two-stage sequential matching scheme is proposed for the successive matches with subpatterns.

However, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the wireless interface through jamming prevents the secondary control system from performing its main tasks, which might compromise the stability of the MG. In this paper, we propose novel, robust and secure secondary control reconfiguration strategy, tailored to counteract DoS attacks. Specifically, upon detecting the impairment of the wireless interface, the jammed secondary control agent notifies its peers via a secure, low-rate powerline channel based on Power Talk communication. This triggers reconfiguration of the wireless communication graph through primary control mode switching, where the jammed agents leave the secondary control by switching to current source mode, and are replaced by non-jammed current sources that switch to voltage source mode and join the secondary control. The strategy fits within the software-defined networking framework, where the network control is split from the data plane using reliable and secure side power talk communication channel, created via software modification of the MG primary control loops. The simulation results illustrate the feasibility of the solution and prove that the MG resilience and performance can be indeed improved via software-defined networking approaches.","2474-9133","978-1-5090-1525-2","10.1109/ICCW.2017.7962775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7962775","","Voltage control;Jamming;Wireless communication;Computer crime;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Switches","carrier transmission on power lines;distributed control;distributed power generation;jamming;power control;power generation control;telecommunication control;telecommunication security;wireless channels","antijamming strategy;distributed microgrid control;power talk communication channel;distributed secondary control reconfiguration system;DC microgrid;MG;off-the-shelf wireless interface solution;IEEE 802.11 standard;denial of service attack;DoS attack;stability;low-rate powerline channel;wireless communication;primary control mode switching;current source mode;nonjammed current source;voltage source mode;security;software-defined networking approach","","7","","18","IEEE","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to some defects of the existing COE mechanism, the functional integrity and security for communication could not be guaranteed. Thus, Safe-COE architecture is designed in this paper. First, safe communication problems in systems are analyzed. Then, based on the Security and Safety Modeling (SESAMO) method, safe building blocks for communication are designed and combining these building blocks with Safe-COE mechanism, a kind of Safe-COE communication architecture is proposed. Finally, communication performance is tested based on this architecture. The results show that based on the general Ethernet MII bus interface, the minimum communication cycle could reach 125 μs , and the minimum synchronization accuracy of peripherals control could be about 100 ns. Moreover, the formal modeling method is used to verify the safe integrity of this architecture. The results show that the architecture could meet related safe requirements of attack protection, data validation, disconnect monitoring, and state switching. Currently, there is no safe communication architecture for a distributed control system that could fully meet related standards and consider both functional safety and information security.

The main purpose of this framework is to maintain good speed scalability and power efficiency over the number of processor cores under severe hardware restrictions for embedded use. Key to the speed scalability is reduction of a communication overhead with parallelized tasks. A data-categorization scheme enables small-overhead cache-coherency maintenance by using directives and instructions from the compiler. In this scheme, the number of cache-flushing time is minimized and parallelized tasks are quickly synchronized by using flags in local memory. As regards power efficiency, to reduce power consumption, power supply to processor cores waiting for other cores is timely and frequently cut off, even in the middle of an application, by using a timely-power- gating scheme. In this scheme, to achieve quick mode transition between ""NORMAL"" mode and ""RESUME POWEROFF"" mode, register values of the processor core are stored in core-local memory, which is active even in ""RESUME POWEROFF"" mode and can be accessed in one or two clock cycles. Measured speed and power of an application show good speed scalability in execution time and high power efficiency, simultaneously. In the case of a secure AAC-LC encoding program, execution speed when eight processor cores are used can be increased by 4.85 times compared to that of sequential execution. Moreover, power consumption under the same condition can be reduced by 51.0% by parallelizing and timely-power gating. The time for mode transition is less than 20 micro seconds, which is only 2.5% of the ""RESUME POWER-OFF"" period.","2332-5690","978-1-4244-4961-3","10.1109/ICPP.2009.6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362472","power-gating;low-power;parallelization","Multicore processing;Scalability;Resumes;Energy consumption;Hardware;Synchronization;Power supplies;Registers;Clocks;Power measurement","cache storage;multiprocessing programs;program compilers;security of data;software maintenance;system-on-chip","green multicore-SoC software-execution;timely-power-gating scheme;octo-core chip multiprocessor;automatic multigrain-parallelizing compiler;OSCAR;data-categorization scheme;cache-coherency maintenance;secure AAC-LC encoding program","","1","","20","IEEE","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such inefficiencies are undesirable and impractical, and are compounded for RESTful service orchestrations in data-intensive industries such as Big Data analytics, cloud computing and life sciences. In this paper, we propose a non-invasive novel technique, Fast-Optimised-REST (FOREST), which enables RESTful services to overcome the traditional bottlenecks experienced during transfer of large sets of data.

The findings demonstrate that REAL preserves the privacy of sites, offers more precise question answers and decreases connectivity and device expense.","","978-1-7281-9090-7","10.1109/ISMSIT50672.2020.9255272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9255272","Wireless sensor network;REAL;Optimum;Antenna;3D diagrams","Wireless communication;Privacy;Wireless sensor networks;Protocols;Aggregates;Sensors;Servers","data privacy;protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","virtual experiments;locking mechanism;state transfer framework;precise anonymous aggregate positions;mutual WSN privacy protocol;privacy requirement;overlapping aggregate locations;k-anonymous position;anonymous shared positions;sensor nodes;wireless sensor network monitoring systems;location privacy;position protection;wireless sensor networks mutual policy;time delay mechanism","","8","","15","IEEE","17 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among all the consequences of this globalization trend, the possible existence of stealthy-inserted hardware Trojans (HTs) has raised a great security concern. Without the awareness of the end users or the original designers of host circuits, HTs are usually inserted stealthily at one of the outsourced design or fabrication stages, remain (almost) harmless to the host on dormant mode, and upon triggered will disturb the functions and/or leak the secrets carried by the host. It could become a serious security leak of the systems built on top of infected chips. Identifying whether a circuit carries an HT is thus of the utmost importance to mission-critical applications. Speaking from the point of HT designers, nets with extreme state probabilities could be used to create rare state combination for the purpose of HT triggering. Besides, HT designers seek nets with low switching probabilities to insert their HTs in order not to increase power leakage. We denote the nets with extreme state probability as extreme nets and the nets with low switching probability as inactive nets. It is commonly believed that in order to minimize the chance of accidental triggering or power analysis, they would be better to choose, among all the nets of the host, the nets that with extreme state probabilities (extreme nets) or the nets that barely switch (inactive nets) to construct the trigger parts of their HTs, respectively. However, a net of a circuit experiences very different state probabilities and switching probabilities on test mode and function mode, and existing works have only considered the former. The nets with low activeness on both test mode and function mode hence will be the “best candidates.” In this paper we will first build the ground on finding the nets with low activeness on function mode, and then propose a fast heuristic method approach. The method runs in minimal complexity, has high accuracy, and is tested on popular benchmarks and large-sized circuits.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2017.2753201","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:106112016CDJZR185512); NSFC(grant numbers:61772092); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8039222","Hardware Trojan (HT);nets activeness;state transition;total state","Switches;Hardware;Fabrication;Registers;Trojan horses;Globalization;Market research","integrated circuit design;invasive software;microprocessor chips","potential trigger detection;stealthy-inserted hardware Trojans;HT designers;extreme state probability;HT triggering;low switching probability;accidental triggering power analysis;function mode;IC industry;serious security leak;mission-critical applications;rare state combination;heuristic method approach;large-sized circuits","","11","","23","IEEE","18 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two information flow properties that have been studied in the context of state transition systems, non-interference and opacity, are reformulated in the current context of policy languages. A comparison between these properties reveals that opacity is the more useful, and more general of the two; indeed, it is shown that non-interference can be stated in terms of opacity. The paper then presents an inference system for non-opacity, or detectability, in Datalog-based policies.

The evolutionary properties of viruses are taken into account in the model by the formal rule that previously immunized or cured nodes, at some interval (the size of which is the model parameter), can be re-infected, and exposure of antivirus protection has a lag time (also is a model parameter). In this model, it was accepted that any network node could be in one of three states: in a protected (immunized) state; in an infected state; in a neutral state. In a neutral state, the node may be infected or immunized. In an immunized state, the node can send out antiviruses, which cures infected and immunizes neutral nodes. In this state, copies of antiviruses (useful viruses) are sent out to the nodes of the network randomly chosen (random choice in the address space indicates of the stochastic behavior). In an infected state, the node can send out copies of viruses to nodes in the network, also by randomly selecting in the address space (this also shows the stochastic behavior). The stochastic dynamics model of the spread of evolving viruses in the computer network was described graphically using a diagram of possible transitions between nodes states which allow one to create a system of kinetic differential equations describing these processes. One of the advantages of the model being developed is the ability to modify and expand it by creating more complex state change graphs and transitions between them. This provides supplementing the system of kinetic equations with a member that considers the overall increasing in the number of users and devices in computer networks over time that can be described by a function of any kind.","","978-1-7281-6700-8","10.1109/CSCMP45713.2019.8976837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8976837","evolving computer viruses;virus outbreaks dynamics;lag times;logistic growth","","computer network security;differential equations;graph theory;invasive software;microorganisms;stochastic processes","neutral nodes;stochastic behavior;infected state;stochastic dynamics model;evolving viruses;computer network;transitions;dynamic model;stochastic spread;immunized cured nodes;antivirus protection;network node;immunized state;computer networks;kinetic differential equations;state change graphs","","","","17","IEEE","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we classify system layers based on their common, coupled, and shared functions. Also, interactions between the classified layers are identified, characterized, and clustered based on their impact on the system. Furthermore, based on the overall function of each layer and types of its components, intra-actions within layers are characterized.

In this paper, a fragile model is developed to evaluate the nodal SCF probability considering the insulation aging of equipment and extreme weather condition. Then, a response framework for extreme weather events is developed for a transmission system to defend the cascading impacts of expected SCFs. Specifically, switches are shifted to restrain the out-of-range short-circuit currents (SCCs) so that to ensure the SCFs can be removed by circuit breakers, generation rescheduling and load shedding are arranged to maintain the post-fault system transient stability. The above measures are optimized simultaneously by an integrated Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP). Considering the error or uncertainty of weather event forecasts, a multi-state model is established to provide the most cost-effective grid resilience enhancement scheme, in which the expected urgent adaptions of the initial scheme subject to weather state transition is included in the overall cost.

However, writing a least privilege policy can be hard and error prone for cloud service providers. In this paper, we propose a framework called Least Privilege for Cloud (LPCloud) to address these concerns. LPCloud automatically produces policies for minimization of administrators' privileges at the granularity of representational state transfer (REST) application program interfaces (API), and enforces the policies without affecting current systems. Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithm to partition privileges based on dependencies between API calls. This paper presents design of LPCloud, including a service called Policy Generator which produces partitioned policies and a component named Policy Enforcer to enforce the policies.

Since data transmissions are susceptible to malicious attacks, jammers of adversaries can successfully block their victim’s communications by transmitting interfering signals to legitimate transmissions. Nowadays, owing to the ability to reconfigure the wireless propagation medium, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is regarded as an effective tool to enhance transmission performance, especially in the jamming context. This paper considers the anti-jamming communication tactical scenario of a solar-powered RIS network, in which the RIS is used to improve the uplink transmission performance between a wireless device (WD) and a base station (BS). We investigate the long-term anti-jamming communications of the WD powered by a solar energy harvester. Our objective is to jointly assign the optimal amount of transmission energy and the RIS phase shifts to maximize the data rate of the system in the long run. To this end, we formulate an anti-jamming communication optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) framework and then design a deep Q network (DQN)-based algorithm to generate an optimal policy. As a result, the optimal resource allocation is achieved through trial-and-error interactions with environment by observing the predefined rewards and the network state transition. The Python simulation results conducted by averaging 104 time slots show that the proposed algorithm is not only able to learn from environment, but also yields better performance than baseline schemes under network changes. Moreover, the performance of RIS communication schemes is verified to be superior to that of without-RIS communication schemes in the jamming context.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3158751","Basic Science Research Program(grant numbers:2020R1I1A3057142); Priority Research Center Program through the National Research Foundation(grant numbers:2019R1A6A1A03032988); Underground City of the Future Program funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9732955","Reconfigurable intelligent surface;deep reinforcement learning;Markov decision process;solar-powered network;jamming attack;battlefield surveillance","Jamming;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Communication system security;Sensors;Resource management;Uplink","deep learning (artificial intelligence);electromagnetic wave propagation;energy harvesting;intelligent materials;jamming;Markov processes;military communication;military computing;optimisation;resource allocation;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor networks;battlefield surveillance;target tracking;local sensor nodes;tactical decisions;wireless propagation medium;reconfigurable intelligent surface;jamming context;solar-powered RIS network;wireless device;solar energy harvester;RIS phase shifts;Markov decision process framework;deep Q network-based algorithm;resource allocation;network state transition;RIS communication schemes;DQN-based algorithm;long-term antijamming communications;antijamming communication optimization problem;antijamming communication tactical scenario","","1","","34","CCBY","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Intelligent attackers can carefully design a destructive and stealthy false data injection attack (FDIA) sequence such that commonly used weighted least squares estimator combined with residual-based detection method is vulnerable to the FDIA. To effectively defend against an FDIA, in this paper, we propose a robust deviation-based detection method, in which an additional Kalman filter is introduced while retaining the original weighted least squares estimator, so that there are two state estimators. Moreover, an exponential weighting function is also applied to the introduced Kalman filter in our proposed method. When an FDIA occurs, the estimation results of weighted least squares estimator depend only on meter measurements at each time slot, but there is an adjustment process of estimated states for the Kalman filter based on historical states' transitions. Meanwhile, based on the exponential weighting function, estimated measurements in the Kalman filter can be adaptively suppressed for different attack strengths of FDIAs, and then the difference of the results of these two estimators increases.

In reality IMS based Telecom and Internet based Web 2.0 networks have their own advantages and need to co-exist to create an enriched user experience. The convergence of IP Multimedia subsystem (IMS) based Telecom and Web 2.0 based networks is slowly gaining momentum. IMS primarily provides an access agnostic network to securely access a variety of communication services with guaranteed Quality of Service (Qos). Web 2.0 on the other hand has provided a different dimension by acting as a platform for creation of innovative community services in a networked world. IMS standardization body Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), has envisioned the need of a service broker to leverage the IMS capabilities in the converged world. IMS as an overlay network that bridges across various wire line and wireless networks, IMS uses gateway Application Servers to access services from outside networks. This paper explores the benefits of using a Service Broker as a gateway for enabling Web 2.0 applications to create context aware Mashups in the Converged IMS and Web 2.0 world. The proposed architecture models the Service Broker, i.e. Service Control interaction Manager (SCIM) to securely access and operate on the user's mobile context in a simple way using Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern. The goal of the architecture is to leverage the rich user information available across disparate applications in the IMS world in a simple and convenient manner to be accessed by the Web 2.0 Mashup to enrich the user's communication experience in the converged network. A use case on healthcare has been successfully implemented on the IIIT Bangalore IMS Innovation Centre test bed to test the above proposed concept.","","978-1-4244-7932-0","10.1109/IMSAA.2010.5729412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5729412","IMS;Service Broker;SCIM;Web 2.0;REST;Blended Services","Context;Medical services;Servers;XML;Logic gates;Context modeling;Mobile communication","authorisation;Internet;internetworking;IP networks;mobile computing;multimedia servers;multimedia systems;subscriber loops","IMS service broker;SCIM;REST;Web 2.0 Mashup;telecom based service provider;Internet;IP multimedia subsystem;Web 2.0 network;access agnostic network;communication service;quality of service;third generation partnership project;overlay network;wire line;wireless networks;gateway application server;context aware Mashup;service control interaction manager;access security;representational state transfer architectural pattern;healthcare;HIT Bangalore IMS Innovation Centre test bed","","","","11","IEEE","10 Mar 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We leverage the packet transmission policies in Wi-Fi to actively elicit packets for the channel state check without modifying the Wi-Fi protocol, such as sending a dummy data packet which will automatically elicit an acknowledgement packet. Comparing to the existing methods that wait passively for the packets from the packet sender for the channel state information, TBAS has the full control of time to collect the channel state, such that it can use stricter rules to classify the packets and achieve higher security. We solve key problems in TBAS, including a Channel State Check (CSC) procedure which determines if two packets are from the same sender, as well as a simple protocol wrapped around CSC to reduce the overhead. We implement TBAS on the Sora software defined ratio and our trace-driven emulations show that TBAS can achieve desirable False Positive and False Negative ratios with very low overhead.","","978-1-5090-1732-4","10.1109/SAHCN.2016.7733021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7733021","","Probes;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Physical layer;Authentication;Protocols;OFDM;History","cryptographic protocols;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","time bounded anti-spoofing;TBAS;spoof detection method;Wi-Fi networks;channel states;channel state change;packet transmission policies;dummy data packet;acknowledgement packet;channel state information;channel state check procedure;CSC procedure;Sora software defined ratio;trace-driven emulations;false positive ratios;false negative ratios","","6","","20","IEEE","3 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since it stores the system states and controls system functionality, security vulnerabilities of FSM have been exploited extensively. Among the potential attacks, fault inject attack (FIA) is one of the most severe and most challenging to defend against. Unlike existing countermeasures, we propose a novel structure for FSM state flip flop design that can mitigate any kind of timing based FIAs. Our key idea is to sample the flip flop input signals multiple times during one clock cycle, and then compare these values to determine the correct one. This can effectively defeat all the FIAs based on violating FSM state setup time constraint. In addition, such design will make the design more robust against jitters. In order to reduce the design overhead, we use the low-cost transmission gates to implement the proposed latch and flip flop. We use Hspice to simulate the error conditions with delayed input data and jitter and the results confirm that our design is error resilient. We also implement the FSM in AES with our proposed flip flops and compare the area overhead with existing FIA countermeasures. Results show that the two state-of-the-art approaches have 2X and 4X area overhead than ours.","2164-1706","978-1-7281-8746-4","10.1109/SOCC49529.2020.9524779","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672182); AFOSR(grant numbers:FA9550-14-1-0351); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524779","Fault injection;Setup time violation;FSM;State transition;State flip-flop","Latches;Jitter;Master-slave;System-on-chip;Registers;Circuit faults;Time factors","clocks;finite state machines;flip-flops;logic design;network synthesis","controls system functionality;potential attacks;fault inject attack;FSM state flip flop design;flip flop input signals multiple times;violating FSM state setup time constraint;low-cost transmission gates;flip flops;existing FIA countermeasures;low-cost fault injection attack resilient FSM design;finite state machine;digital circuit design;system states","","","","14","IEEE","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent development in the Internet infrastructure has introduced prosperous in-network computation resources across the network. To exploit such distributed resources, in this article, we propose a core-graphbased framework, called FRank, for fast node ranking algorithms, which accelerates convergence and reduces communication cost by converting most inter-partition state change propagations into intra-partition ones. We have implemented FRank in a cluster to validate its correctness and efficiency.

A further method for combating viral transmission is to develop preventative strategies associated with a given performance of a network that may be described using population models compared to the few employed with epidemiological analyses. An updated variation of such  $SIR$  (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) framework is offered here, along with an explanation of whether these parameters correspond to network properties.

This study’s aim appeared to be to demonstrate the effects and applicability of such FO-SAIR differential scheme.

These models also generalize the monotonic transform model of Sandhu, and its non-monotonic extension (NMT) by Sandhu and Suri. The authors argue that NMT is inadequate for expressing the document release example discussed by Sandhu and Suri, because it can test only one access matrix cell in its state changing commands.

Erasure is a way of strengthening confidentiality by upgrading data confidentiality levels, up to the extreme of demanding the removal of secret data from the system. In this paper, we propose a certification technique for confidentiality of complete Java classes that includes non-interference and erasure policies. This technique is based on rewriting logic, which is a very general logical and semantic framework that is efficiently implemented in the high-level programming language Maude. In order to achieve a finite state transition system, we develop an abstract Java semantics which correctly approximates non-interference and erasure. The analysis produces certificates that are independently checkable, and are small enough to be used in practice. We have implemented our methodology and developed some experiments that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.","","978-1-4244-9816-1","10.1109/SYNASC.2010.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715278","program verification;confidentiality;non interference;erasure;rewriting logic;abstract interpretation","Java;Semantics;Instruments;Equations;Safety;Observers;Influenza","finite state machines;high level languages;Java;rewriting systems;security of data","rewriting logic;semantic program;secret data;data confidentiality;high level programming language;finite state transition system;Java","","1","","21","IEEE","17 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing defense against A2 Trojans mainly relies on runtime detection mechanism which needs large monitor hardware overhead and complicated identification/handling software. To address these limitations, this article proposes a built-in structure to accelerate the activation of A2 Trojans, which consists of several composite-logic ring oscillators and a multiple-purpose controller. In addition, two post-fabrication detection schemes named time-division mode-switching (TDMS) and scan-based fault test compatible (SFTC) are proposed. TDMS detection scheme can discover A2 Trojans when running functional patterns by inserting oscillating operations every other cycle. SFTC detection scheme can detect A2 Trojans during scan-based fault test by introducing oscillation before each capture operation. Evaluations across a wide range of A2 Trojans and benchmarks show that our proposal is more power-efficient and area-saving compared with existing monitor structure.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2020.2977069","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61832018); Science and Technology Planning Project of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019RS2027); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9018186","A2 Trojan;accelerate activation;oscillator;security;trojan detection","Trojan horses;Payloads;Hardware;Registers;Monitoring;Detectors;Acceleration","controllers;integrated circuit design;invasive software;oscillators;production engineering computing;semiconductor industry","hardware Trojan attacks;design strategy;A2 Trojan detection;built-in acceleration structure;semiconductor industry;digital logic;runtime detection mechanism;composite-logic ring oscillators;multiple-purpose controller;post-fabrication detection schemes;time-division mode-switching;TDMS;scan-based fault test compatible;SFTC;oscillating operations;power-efficiency","","7","","34","IEEE","28 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model provides for enforcement of access control protocols through FSM specification on units of data that can vary in size from one region of memory to another. Threads executing transactions do not explicitly request locks on data items-they simply access the data items while locking is performed automatically and in many instances without software intervention. This is facilitated by hardware assistance in that the FSM definitions and lock unit state information is stored in caches. Only when a thread is suspended are the state changes communicated to the software lock manager. Delays for lock acquisitions through the MVM model architecture are determined and compared to delays due to lock acquisition by a conventional lock manager.","1098-8068","0-8186-8114-4","10.1109/IDEAS.1997.625700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=625700","","Access protocols;Access control;Hardware;Protection;Yarn;Memory management;Operating systems;Computer architecture;Delay;Resource management","concurrency control;distributed databases;network operating systems;transaction processing;authorisation;security of data;memory protocols;finite state machines;cache storage;storage management;database theory","multi-view memory model;OS locking;operating system locking;transaction processing systems;access control protocols;FSM specification;threads;lock unit state information;cache;software lock manager;delays;MVM model architecture;lock acquisition;concurrency control;finite state machines","","1","14","39","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the framework's release, Noise-based protocols have been adopted by WhatsApp, WireGuard and other high-profile applications. We present Noise Explorer, an online engine for designing, reasoning about, formally verifying and implementing arbitrary Noise Handshake Patterns. Based on our formal treatment of the Noise Protocol Framework, Noise Explorer can validate any Noise Handshake Pattern and then translate it into a model ready for automated verification and also into a production-ready software implementation written in Go or in Rust. We use Noise Explorer to analyze more than 57 handshake patterns. We confirm the stated security goals for 12 fundamental patterns and provide precise properties for the rest. We also analyze unsafe handshake patterns and document weaknesses that occur when validity rules are not followed. All of this work is consolidated into a usable online tool that presents a compendium of results and can parse formal verification results to generate detailed-but-pedagogical reports regarding the exact security goals of each message of a Noise Handshake Pattern with respect to each party, under an active attacker and including malicious principals.

DIFUZZRTL develops a register-coverage guided fuzzing technique, which efficiently yet correctly identifies a state transition in the finite state machine of RTL designs. DIFUZZRTL also develops several new techniques in consideration of unique RTL design characteristics, including cycle-sensitive register coverage guiding, asynchronous interrupt events handling, a unified CPU input format with Tilelink protocols, and drop-in-replacement designs to support various CPU RTLs. We implemented DIFUZZRTL, and performed the evaluation with three real-world open source CPU RTLs: OpenRISC Mor1kx Cappuccino, RISC-V Rocket Core, and RISC-V Boom Core. During the evaluation, DIFUZZRTL identified 16 new bugs from these CPU RTLs, all of which were confirmed by the respective development communities and vendors.

Vehicles can exchange information to extend their perception horizon, exchange driving modes to enhance scene understanding and most importantly cooperate directly with other automated and autonomous vehicles in cooperative driving maneuvers such as platooning. In this paper we present a novel communication protocol built on the current vehicular communication standard IEEE 802.11p, which enables negotiation and execution of cooperative driving maneuvers based on distributed state machines. The main goal of this protocol is to achieve a common synchronized state and common state transitions while supporting fault-tolerance and self-supervision under security and safety constraints.

The result is a new paradigm known as distributed trust; this article attempts to survey that landscape. ""Divide and conquer"" can be a powerful tool for disentangling complexity when designing a computing system. However, some aspects of system design are inseparable. Treating these as though they were independent leads to one interfering with the other, and ""divide and be conquered"" perhaps better characterizes the consequences. For some years, we have been investigating how to construct systems that continue functioning despite component failures and attacks. A question we have pondered is to what extent does divide and conquer apply? Somewhat less than you might hope is, unfortunately, the answer. One could argue that attacks can be seen as just another cause for component failure. The Byzantine fault model asserts that a faulty component can exhibit arbitrarily malicious (so-called ""Byzantine"") behavior; a system that tolerates Byzantine faults should then be able to handle anything. Moreover, because any component can be viewed abstractly in terms of its state and a set of possible next-state transitions - in short, a state machine - fault-tolerant services can be built by assembling enough state-machine copies so that outputs from the ones exhibiting Byzantine behavior are outvoted by the correctly functioning ones. The fault-tolerance of the ensemble thus exceeds the fault-tolerance of any individual state machine, and a distributed fault-tolerance is the result. A closer look at such replicated state machines, however, reveals problems ""when attacks are possible. Specific difficulties with the approach and how we can overcome these are described later in this article, but the overall vision remains compelling: place more trust in an ensemble than in any of its individual components. In analogy with distributed fault-tolerance, then, we are seeking ways to implement distributed trust.","1558-4046","","10.1109/MSP.2005.125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514398","cryptography;trusted systems;state machines","Cryptography;Computer security;Privacy;Resists;Hardware;Cryptographic protocols;Computational modeling;Distributed computing;Computer crime","security of data;software fault tolerance;client-server systems;divide and conquer methods;finite state machines","trustworthy service;replicated state machine;distributed trust;divide and conquer method;computing system design;Byzantine fault model;faulty component;fault-tolerant services;distributed fault-tolerance","","13","3","37","IEEE","3 Oct 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This article proposes a general framework to establish a systematic procedure for comparing different formulations. We apply the procedure to the three current state-of-the-art formulations in this context: tight and compact (TC), state transition (ST), and projected two-binary-variable (2bin). We carry out an exhaustive analysis over 54 problem instances of very different sizes (10 to 1888 generators) and time scopes (24 and 168h), for four alternative definitions of additional constraints. Our results favor the TC formulation in general in terms of the integrality gap and CPU time.

The secondary users (SUs) can concurrently access the same band as the primary users (PUs) using an underlay protocol provided that the transmit power of SUs keeps below the maximum tolerable interference threshold at PUs. On the other hand, we utilize maximal ratio combining (MRC) scheme at the secondary relays and maximal ratio transmission (MRT) scheme at the secondary destination to improve the secrecy performance due to the fact that the eavesdropper can intercept the secondary network communication. The max-link relay selection scheme is also adopted to enhance the secrecy performance by selecting the best link among all available source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for secrecy outage probability by modeling the dynamic buffer state transitions as the Markov chain. The findings of this paper demonstrate that multi-antenna relaying networks yield to better secrecy performance than single antenna relaying networks.

We then establish the node state transition model by epidemic theory and Markov chain. Further, we obtain the dynamic equations of the transition between nodes and the calculation formula of node availability. The simulation result is that when the degree of node is small and the node vulnerability function is a power function, the node availability is the highest; when the degree of node is large and the node vulnerability function satisfies the exponential function and the power function, the node availability is high. Therefore, when constructing a NBIOT-HWSNs network, node protection is implemented according to the degree of node, so that when the node vulnerability function satisfies the power function, all nodes can maintain high availability, thus making the entire network more stable.","","978-1-7281-0120-0","10.1109/ICSAI.2018.8599320","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599320","Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks;NB-IoT;malware;node availability","Wireless sensor networks;Security;Mathematical model;Malware;Mobile communication;Markov processes;Monitoring","Internet of Things;invasive software;Markov processes;wireless sensor networks","node protection;node availability;node state transition model;vulnerability differences;node distribution;node heterogeneity model;NB-IoT;heterogeneous wireless sensor networks;nodes availability analysis;power function;node vulnerability function","","","","18","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The unavailability of middlebox is a key metric. The previous study considers allocating backup servers to middleboxes to reduce the unavailability. While it adopts shared protection to save backup capacity, resource sharing has not been sufficiently explored as each middlebox can only use one backup server. This paper presents a backup allocation model in which a function can be protected by two backup servers and a backup server can protect multiple functions under a shared protection strategy to minimize the maximum unavailability among functions. We use Markov chains to analyze the state transitions and make equilibrium-state equations. By solving them, we obtain the probability of each state of the allocation and compute an unavailability of function. We introduce two algorithms to examine the proposed model; one of them uses the performance bound of the maximum unavailability which is analyzed in this paper. Numerical results show that the proposed model reduces the maximum unavailability by 13.9-51.2% compared to a baseline model that allocates one backup server for each middlebox in our examined cases.","2693-9789","978-1-6654-0694-9","10.1109/NetSoft54395.2022.9844095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9844095","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Markov processes;Middleboxes;Mathematical models;Software;Numerical models","computer network reliability;computer network security;Markov processes;network servers;resource allocation;virtualisation","two-stage shared protection;general-purpose server;network function virtualization;backup server;backup capacity;shared protection strategy;maximum unavailability;unavailability-aware backup allocation model;middleboxes;resource sharing;Markov chains;state transitions;equilibrium-state equations","","","","21","IEEE","3 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Tremendous pressure on today's enterprises to achieve and sustain competitive advantage has led to heightened efforts to protect sensitive information. Many enterprises have recognized that the key to sensitive information management improvement lies in the better access control model. In this paper, we present a boundary-based access control model incorporating an advanced security mechanism, in order to support fine-grained authorizations in the right time for the provision of services, based on the analysis of system boundary. In this model, access permissions are controlled by the state transitions at different layers including workflow layers, control layers and data layers. The access control mechanism is based on an RBAC model, which incorporates dynamic context information. Context is classified based on the analysis of system boundary into six main categories, which is further categorized as simple condition and composite condition, thus forming a multi-level context. In a multi-level hierarchy of context conditions, the access control model is implemented dynamically, by checking the context constraint associated with each access task at the time of the specific request submission, whose functionality and the constituent parts have been described formally and in detail.","","978-0-7695-3600-2","10.1109/IFITA.2009.274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5232219","system boundary;access control;multi-level context","Access control;Authorization;Permission;Protection;Context modeling;Information technology;Information management;Shipbuilding industry;Data security;Information security","authorisation","boundary-based access control model;sensitive information protection;information management;advanced security mechanism;fine-grained authorization;workflow layers;control layers;data layers;RBAC model","","","","6","IEEE","4 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By decoupling NFs from physical devices, network function virtualization enables virtual network functions (VNF) to run in virtual machines (VMs). However, VNFs are vulnerable to various faults such as software and hardware failures. To enhance VNF fault tolerance, the deployment of backup VNFs in stand-by VM instances is necessary. In case of stateful VNFs, stand-by instances require constant state updates from active instances during its operation. This will guarantee a correct and seamless handover from failed instances to stand-by instances after failures. Nevertheless, such state updates to stand-by instances could consume significant network bandwidth resources and lead to potential admission failures for VNF requests. In this paper, we study the fault-tolerant VNF placement problem with the optimization objective of admitting as many requests as possible. In particular, the VNF placement of active/stand-by instances, the request routing paths to active instances, and state transfer paths to stand-by instances are jointly considered. We devise an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve this problem, and propose a bicriteria approximation algorithm with performance guarantees for a special case of the problem. Simulations with realistic settings show that our algorithms can significantly improve the request admission rate compared to conventional approaches.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-3180-5","10.1109/ICC.2018.8422444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8422444","","Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Delays;Bandwidth;Routing;Software;Approximation algorithms","computer network security;fault tolerance;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication network routing;virtual machines;virtualisation","stand-by VM instances;fault-tolerant VNF placement problem;state transfer paths;fault-tolerant placement;stateful virtualized network functions;network function virtualization;virtual network functions;virtual machines;hardware failures;VNF fault tolerance","","19","","21","IEEE","30 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Information exchange occurs only when feedback between the participants of the communication process is possible in media space, and also when each social actor is given the opportunity to act as a subject of media communication. In this case, the possibility of information exchange within the framework of subject-object and subject-subject media communication relations is guaranteed mainly by the digital infrastructure of media tools and media platforms, through which the involvement of social actors in communication processes aimed at the implementation of public management to address socially important issues of life support, social significance and security is ensured. Social media communication is a factor of the digital public administration and forms its main qualitative characteristics and properties. Without the inclusion of actors of the public sphere in the digital media communication processes in the modern realities it is impossible to realize the conditions of the digital public administration, including the assessment of the effectiveness of its implementation and parameters of manageability. In this regard, the media and communication framework of the phenomenon of «governability» in the system of digital public management is the subject of this study. In strategic terms, governability in the system of the digital public administration is determined by its network organization instead of the classical hierarchical forms of interaction of public administration actors (see L.V. Smorgunov. Governability and network public administration, 2014). «Network» concept is considered by various authors in terms of public administration approach, therefore in the scientific literature it is also called the theory of political-management networks. Emerged together with the concept of new public management, the concept of political networks is based on the same postulates: the state changes the usual hierarchical form of administration to a new form of management. The difference between the two approaches lies in the fact that while in the new state management, market relations prevail over hierarchy, in the concept of political networks, communication processes play a key role in managerial and political processes. And, accordingly, the network organization of the digital public administration emerges through communication links of actors in the public sphere, which are formed in the digital media space. Spatial and infrastructural «turn» of digital media communications is considered by the author as a theoretical and methodological constant in identifying the set of factors of public management and the special properties and characteristics of media environments, in which the implementation of digital public management is possible.","2768-4873","979-8-3503-2003-9","10.1109/ComSDS58064.2023.10130416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10130416","Governability;digital public administration;media communications","Seminars;Social networking (online);Semantics;Decision making;Organizations;Media;Security","public administration;social networking (online)","communication links;communication process;digital infrastructure;digital media communication processes;digital media communications;digital media space;digital public administration system;digital public management;information exchange;media communication framework;media environments;media platforms;media tools;network public administration;public administration actors;public administration approach;social actor;social communication;social media communication;subject-subject media communication relations","","","","18","IEEE","25 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typically, branch predictors are leveraged to trigger mis-speculation in transient execution attacks. In this work, we demonstrate a new class of speculation-based attacks that targets the branch prediction unit (BPU). We find that speculative resolution of conditional branches (i.e., in nested speculation) alter the states of pattern history table (PHT) in modern processors, which are not restored after the corresponding branches are later squashed. Such characteristic allows attackers to exploit the BPU as the secret transmitting medium in transient execution attacks. To evaluate the discovered vulnerability, we build a novel attack framework, BranchSpectre, that enables exfiltration of unintended secrets through observing speculative PHT updates (in the form of covert and side channels). We further investigate the PHT collision mechanism in the history-based predictor and the branch prediction mode transitions in Intel processors. Built upon such knowledge, we implement an ultra-high speed covert channel (BranchSpectre-cc) as well as two side channels (i.e., BranchSpectre-v1 and BranchSpectre-v2) that merely rely on BPU for mis-speculation trigger and secret inference in the speculative domain. Notably, BranchSpectre side channels can take advantage of much simpler code patterns than those used in Spectre attacks. We present an extensive BranchSpectre code gadget analysis on a set of popular real-world application code bases followed by a demonstration of side channel attack on OpenSSL. The evaluation results show substantially wider existence and higher exploitability of BranchSpectre code patterns in real-world software. Finally, we discuss several secure branch prediction mechanisms that can mitigate transient execution attacks exploiting modern branch predictors.","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2021.3122830","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-2008339); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9591268","Branch predictor;transient execution attacks;nested speculation;pattern history;side channels","Transient analysis;Program processors;History;Codes;Microarchitecture;Timing;Hardware","cryptography;microprocessor chips;security of data","modern branch predictors;speculative world;transient execution attacks;speculation-based attacks;branch prediction unit;BPU;speculative resolution;conditional branches;nested speculation;attack framework;speculative PHT updates;history-based predictor;branch prediction mode transitions;BranchSpectre-v;speculative domain;spectre attacks;side channel attack;BranchSpectre code patterns;secure branch prediction mechanisms;misspeculation trigger;pattern history table","","4","","56","IEEE","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

All these attacks are centered around a common set of behaviors: During speculative execution, the architectural state of the system is kept unmodified, until the speculation can be verified. In the event that a misspeculation occurs, then anything that can affect the architectural state is reverted (squashed) and re-executed correctly. However, the same is not true for the microarchitectural state. Normally invisible to the user, changes to the microarchitectural state can be observed through various side-channels, with timing differences caused by the memory hierarchy being one of the most common and easy to exploit. The speculative side-channels can then be exploited to perform attacks that can bypass software and hardware checks in order to leak information. These attacks, out of which the most infamous are perhaps Spectre and Meltdown, have led to a frantic search for solutions. In this work, we present our own solution for reducing the microarchitectural state-changes caused by speculative execution in the memory hierarchy. It is based on the observation that if we only allow accesses that hit in the L1 data cache to proceed, then we can easily hide any microarchitectural changes until after the speculation has been verified. At the same time, we propose to prevent stalls by value predicting the loads that miss in the L1. Value prediction, though speculative, constitutes an invisible form of speculation, not seen outside the core. We evaluate our solution and show that we can prevent observable microarchitectural changes in the memory hierarchy while keeping the performance and energy costs at 11% and 7%, respectively. In comparison, the current state of the art solution, InvisiSpec, incurs a 46% performance loss and a 51% energy increase.","2575-713X","978-1-4503-6669-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8980347","speculative execution;side-channel attacks;caches","","cache storage;computer architecture;cryptography;microprocessor chips","invisible speculative execution;high-performance general-purpose CPUs;microarchitectural state-changes;speculative side-channels;architectural state;security attacks;memory hierarchy;value prediction","","","","62","","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the attackers can sometimes infer sensitive information from the patterns of the encrypted network traffic, which poses a threat to network security. Most existing countermeasures are proposed to obfuscate traffic flows using adversarial examples. However, there are two challenges when adding perturbations to live network traffic. Firstly, the perturbations imposed on the feature space cannot be conveniently projected to original traffic flows in feature-space based methods. Secondly, it is laborious and impractical to apply symmetrical framework to encode/decode the adversarial traffic in traffic-space based approaches. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose an asymmetric defending scheme, namely Prism, to protect the live connection privacy against attacks of temporal network traffic analyzers. Specifically, Prism first extracts standardized temporal features via Power-Law Division (PLD) algorithm, and then employs Time-stacked State Transition Model (TSTM) to obtain the fingerprint of each application. Finally, Prism defends against the analyzers with online traffic perturbation. Since the Prism is designed as a traffic-space based defender with asymmetric defending structure, the deployment is lightweight and efficient. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our adversarial perturbations. In particular, it is encouraging to see that our proposed defending scheme outperforms the advanced countermeasures, such as adversarial training and traffic filter.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2023.3267885","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U2003111); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10103708","Traffic analysis;flow correlation;adversarial examples;privacy defense","Perturbation methods;Feature extraction;Privacy;Real-time systems;Encryption;Correlation;Payloads","computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;feature extraction;perturbation techniques;telecommunication traffic","adversarial traffic;application fingerprint;asymmetric defending scheme;encrypted network traffic;feature-space based methods;live network traffic;network monitoring;PLD algorithm;power-law division algorithm;Prism;real-time privacy protection;standardized temporal features;temporal network traffic analyzers;time-stacked state transition model;TSTM","","","","59","IEEE","17 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It characterizes whether a “secret” of a system can be inferred by an outside observer called an “intruder.” We consider the problem of enforcing opacity in partially-observed discrete event systems modeled as automata. We propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output of the system that changes the system's output behavior by inserting additional observable events. The insertion function must respond to the full system's output behavior. Also, the insertion function should not create new observed behavior but only replicate existing observable strings. We define the property of “i-enforceability,” when there exists an insertion function that renders a non-opaque system opaque. To synthesize insertion functions that ensure opacity, we define and construct a new structure called the “All Insertion Structure” (AIS). The AIS can be used to verify if a given opacity property is i-enforceable. The AIS enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in a compact state transition structure. If a given opacity property has been verified to be i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to synthesize an i-enforcing insertion function.","0743-1546","978-1-4673-2066-5","10.1109/CDC.2012.6426760","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6426760","","Automata;Observers;Security;Monitoring;Synchronization;Solids;ISO standards","automata theory;discrete event systems;security of data","opacity properties;insertion functions;confidentiality property;security properties;networked systems;partially-observed discrete event systems;automata;enforcement mechanism based;i-enforceability;all insertion structure","","13","","15","IEEE","4 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A set of $N$ sensors make noisy linear observations of a discrete-time linear process with Gaussian noise, and report the observations to a remote estimator. The challenge is the presence of a few potentially malicious sensors which can start strategically manipulating their observations at a random time in order to skew the estimates. The quickest attack detection problem for a known linear attack scheme is posed as a constrained Markov decision process in order to minimize the expected detection delay subject to a false alarm constraint, with the state involving the probability belief at the estimator that the system is under attack. State transition probabilities are derived in terms of system parameters, and the structure of the optimal policy is derived analytically. It turns out that the optimal policy amounts to checking whether the probability belief exceeds a threshold.

In order to take full advantage of the benefits provided by the multiple antennas at the destination and the available relays, we adopt the max-link relay selection scheme and propose a half-duplex and two full-duplex secure transmission schemes for secrecy improvement, i.e., 1) maximal-ratio combining (MRC), 2) maximal-ratio combining/cooperative jamming (MRC/CJ), and 3) zero-forcing beamforming/cooperative jamming (ZFB/CJ).

Moreover, simple and informative asymptotic results are provided under both L → ∞ and L → ∞ scenarios (where L denotes the buffer size), from which we can obtain further insights on the secrecy diversity gain and the secrecy coding gain. The highlights of this paper can be summarized as follows: 1) Under L → ∞ scenario, the secrecy diversity gains of all proposed schemes both reach M. When L → ∞, the secrecy diversity gains of MRC, MRC/CJ and ZFB/CJ increase to M (1 + ND), MND and 2M respectively, where M is the number of relays and ND represents the number of antennas at the destination; 2) The secrecy coding gain of the system differs with different schemes, and it improves with the increase of M and ND under both the two scenarios; and 3) Under the scenario L → ∞, ZFB/CJ outperforms MRC and MRC/CJ across the entire signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range of interest, however, when L→ ∞, ZFB/CJ outperforms MRC/CJ and MRC in the low SNR regime, while the opposite holds in the high SNR regime.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907781","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771487,61371122); National University of Defense Technology(grant numbers:NO.ZS18-02-04); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8676270","Buffer-aided relay;multi-antenna;full-duplex;secrecy outage probability;secrecy diversity gain;secrecy coding gain","Relays;Jamming;Signal to noise ratio;Diversity methods;Power system reliability;Probability;Antennas","cooperative communication;decode and forward communication;diversity reception;jamming;Markov processes;MIMO communication;probability;relay networks (telecommunication);telecommunication security","secrecy outage performance;DF buffer-aided relaying networks;multiantenna destination;multiple antennas;max-link relay selection scheme;full-duplex secure transmission schemes;secrecy improvement;maximal-ratio combining;jamming;MRC/CJ;secrecy outage probability;dynamic buffer state transitions;informative asymptotic results;buffer size;secrecy diversity gain;secrecy coding gain;ZFB/CJ","","3","","33","OAPA","29 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the state transition table (STT) of a large-scale DBSM AC-DFA can span hundreds of megabytes of system memory, whose limited bandwidth and long latency could become the performance bottleneck We propose a novel partitioning algorithm which converts an AC-DFA into a ¿head¿ and a ¿body¿ parts. The head part behaves as a traditional AC-DFA that matches the pattern prefixes up to a predefined length; the body part extends any head match to the full pattern length in parallel body-tree traversals. Taking advantage of the SIMD instructions in modern x86-64 multi-core processors, we design compact and efficient data structures packing multi-path and multi-stride pattern segments in the body-tree. Compared with an optimized AC-DFA solution, our head-body matching (HBM) implementation achieves 1.2x to 3x throughput performance when the input match (attack) ratio varies from 2% to 32%, respectively. Our HBM data structure is over 20x smaller than a fully-populated AC-DFA for both Snort and ClamAV dictionaries.

An attacker can utilize these vulnerabilities to perform fault injection attacks or insert malicious hardware modifications (Trojan) to gain unauthorized access to some specific states. To our knowledge, no systematic approaches have been proposed to analyze these vulnerabilities in FSM. In this paper, we develop a framework named Analyzing Vulnerabilities in FSM (AVFSM) which extracts the state transition graph (including the don't-care states and transitions) from a gate-level netlist using a novel Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) based approach and quantifies the vulnerabilities of the design to fault injection and hardware Trojan insertion.

Many protocols of opportunistic routing have been proposed to increase transmission reliability and network throughput. Instead of using a dedicated next hop, opportunistic routing can consider multiple downstream nodes as potential forwarders. The decision of which nodes being chosen to forward packets is made by the coordination schema. Although the coordination helps opportunistic routing to deliver opportunistic gains, it requires a batch-based schedule to minimize the cost, which may prevent spatial channel reuse and thus under utilize wireless media. In this paper, we explain the fundamental idea of opportunistic routing and propose a discrete-time Markov chain as a general model to map the transmission process. It demonstrates how to map batch-based packet transmissions in the network with state transitions in a Markov chain. Our model considers the pipelined data transfer and evaluates opportunistic routing under different wireless networks in terms of the expected number of transmissions and time slots.

To address these issues, we propose EFSHARD, an efficient state sharding blockchain system that enables allocating states flexibly and timely across shards according to recent transactions. Firstly, we propose a hierarchical state partition to enable flexible mapping of states to shards. Second, we design a new state transfer protocol to efficiently migrate states across shards while guaranteeing consistency and liveness. Then, we provide a greedy-based state allocation algorithm to decide when and how to migrate states. The allocation mechanism groups highly correlated state data into the same shard to reduce the proportion of cross-shard transactions and distributes state data to shards with relatively low load to balance workload, thus improving the performance. In the end, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate EFSHARD and the results demonstrate that EFSHARD outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of transaction throughput, confirmation latency, workload balance, and queue size of transaction pool.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2023.3236433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10015800","blockchain;sharding;state allocation;state transfer;data partition","Blockchains;Sharding;Resource management;Smart contracts;Security;History;Throughput","","","","","","","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

"Effects of layer thickness for SAW, PSAW, and HVPSAW devices","M.

A large number of applications relate to cellular and mobile telephony, pagers, local area networks, cordless phones, global positioning systems (GPS), and security systems. Pseudo-SAW (PSAW) and high velocity PSAW (HVPSAW) have received great attention because of their high phase velocities and, therefore, the high frequencies of operation that these modes provide. In addition to high phase velocities, the pseudomodes must also present low propagation losses and considerably high electromechanical coupling coefficients to be considered for surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices. This paper verifies that the metallic layer thickness is a relevant SAW device parameter, which must be considered to achieve lower losses for high frequency, low loss SAW devices. Popular PSAW and HVPSAW material orientations, such as 64/spl deg/ YX LiNbO/sub 3/ (0/spl deg/-26/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), 36/spl deg/ YX LiTaO/sub 3/ (0/spl deg/ -54/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), LiNbO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 36/spl deg/), LiTaO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 31/spl deg/), and Li/sub 2/B/sub 4/O/sub 7/ (0/spl deg/ 47.3/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/), are considered as examples. In addition to the reduced loss analysis and the dispersion analysis for the pseudo modes, the present work discusses the transitions with respect to the layer thickness from the PSAWs and HVPSAWs to the generalized SAWs (GSAWs) and Rayleigh (sagittal particle motion) modes. In addition to contributing to the knowledge of the pseudomodes behavior with layer thickness, this mode transition analysis enlightens the situation in which the losses in the pseudo modes go to zero because of the merging of the pseudo modes into the SAWs (GSAWs and Rayleigh). The fact that the SAWs are a continuation as a function of thickness for the pseudo modes may be conveniently used in the fabrication of low loss devices. In addition, the effects of heavy layer metals, such as gold, in reducing the layer thickness at which the pseudo modes merge to the SAWs are discussed. Numerical results are compared with experimental data available in the literature, and the present analysis elucidates experimentally observed higher order pseudo modes and values of layer thickness for which lower losses are achieved.","1525-8955","","10.1109/58.895914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=895914","","Surface acoustic waves;Surface acoustic wave devices;Frequency;Performance loss;Cellular networks;Telephony;Local area networks;Global Positioning System;Propagation losses;Acoustic waves","surface acoustic wave devices;losses;ultrasonic dispersion","HVPSAW devices;PSAW devices;SAW devices;pseudo-SAW;high velocity PSAW;phase velocities;propagation losses;electromechanical coupling coefficients;metallic layer thickness;dispersion analysis;generalized SAWs;Rayleigh modes;sagittal particle motion;mode transition analysis;LiNbO/sub 3/;LiTaO/sub 3/;Li/sub 2/B/sub 4/O/sub 7/","","6","","19","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given the mounting cyber-attack threats, these critical ICT systems create great security issues for smart grids. Additionally, the clever attackers have the ability to not only access and monitor the smart grid, but also hack it by launching well-established cyber-attacks. Thus, this article is devoted to understanding the potential stealthy cyber-attack and its countermeasure. First, this article proposes a stealthy sparse cyber-attack model in an ac smart grid by considering both the residual test-based detector and the interval-state-estimation-based detector, which is not considered in previous studies. The design model is formulated as a constrained optimization problem by minimizing the number of contaminated meters, where the characteristics of two types of detector are considered simultaneously as the constraints for the first time. A constrained differential evolution (CDE) is proposed as the solver because the optimization problem is NP-hard. Then, a generalized-cumulative-sum-based detector is developed to detect the proposed cyber-attacks, where a fractional-order state transition matrix is originally introduced into the estimator to describe the dynamics of the power system. Numerical studies illustrate the feasibility of CDE-based stealthy sparse cyber-attacks and the effectiveness of the proposed countermeasure.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2021.3129487","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1966202); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623481","Constrained differential evolution (CDE);false data injection attack (FDIA);generalized cumulative sum;smart grid security;stealthy sparse cyber-attack","Detectors;Smart grids;Optimization;State estimation;Phasor measurement units;Power system dynamics;Pollution measurement","computer crime;distributed power generation;evolutionary computation;optimisation;power engineering computing;power system security;smart power grids","ac smart grid;next-generation power grids;advanced information;communication technology;cyber-attack threats;critical ICT systems;clever attackers;countermeasure;stealthy sparse cyber-attack model;residual test-based detector;interval-state-estimation-based detector;constrained optimization problem;constrained differential evolution;generalized-cumulative-sum-based detector;power system;CDE-based stealthy sparse cyber-attacks","","17","","35","IEEE","22 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The technique is based on rewriting logic, which is efficiently implemented in the high-level programming language Maude. Starting from a previous Java abstract semantics specification written in Maude, we develop an information flow sensitive Java semantics that allows us to observe global non-interference properties, with object aliasing. In order to achieve a finite state transition system, we develop an abstract Java semantics that we use for secure and effective confidentiality analysis.

In any hybrid security system, the human portion needs to trust the machine portion. To do so, both must understand the expected behavior for every state‐how the system can fail and what those failures look like. The machine must be able to communicate its state and have the capacity to alert the humans when an expected state transition doesn't happen as expected. Things will go wrong, either by accident or as the result of an attack, and the humans are going to need to troubleshoot the system in real time‐that requires understanding on both parts. Each time things go wrong, and the machine portion doesn't communicate well, the human portion trusts it a little less. Humans and machines have different strengths. Humans are flexible and can do creative thinking in ways that machines cannot. But they're easily fooled. Machines are more rigid and can handle state changes and process flows much better than humans can.

As the complexity of rule-sets increases, traditional string matching engines are being replaced by more sophisticated regular expression engines. To keep up with line rates, deal with denial of service attacks and provide predictable resource provisioning, the design of such engines must allow examining payload traffic at several gigabits per second and provide worst case speed guarantees. While regular expression matching using deterministic finite automata (DFA) is a well studied problem in theory, its implementation either in software or specialized hardware is complicated by prohibitive memory requirements. This is especially true for DFAs representing complex regular expressions present in practical rule-sets. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to drastically reduce the DFA memory requirement and still provide worst-case speed guarantees. Specifically, we merge several ""non-equivalent"" states in a DFA by introducing labels on their input and output transitions. We then propose a data structure to represent the merged states and the transition labels. We show that, with very few assumptions about the original DFA, such a transformation results in significant compression in the DFA representation. We have implemented a state merging and transition labeling algorithm for DFAs, and show that for Snort and Bro security rule-sets, state merging results in memory reductions of an order of magnitude.","0743-166X","1-4244-1047-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215710","","Merging;Doped fiber amplifiers;Engines;Pattern matching;Intrusion detection;Computer crime;Payloads;Automata;Hardware;Data structures","finite automata;search problems;security of data;telecommunication security","memory-efficient regular expression search;state merging;pattern matching;critical network services;intrusion detection;policy management;rule-sets;string matching engines;regular expression engines;line rates;denial of service attacks;resource provisioning;payload traffic;regular expression matching;deterministic finite automata;DFA memory requirement;non-equivalent states;data structure;merged states;transition labels;transition labeling algorithm","","83","3","18","IEEE","29 May 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IRI 2004.","23 May 2005","2004","","","467","474","Due to increasing incidents of security breaches in the cyber space, a rigorous user authentication process has become crucial. A very feasible biometric approach to verify the authenticity of a user is to examine his/her typing patterns. There is a significant difference in the keystroke patterns exhibited from person to person, even when asked to type the same words. Typing patterns can be shown in the intervals between keys, holding time, overlap keys, etc. Individuals typing pattern develops naturally and uniquely just as each person write differently. We propose an analytical process based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) to learn the special patterns from individuals, and then to identify them. During training, the timing information of each keystroke is recorded at its holding and releasing events, and the pattern is then extracted from the relationship of the events within a word. The experiment to be conducted is to authenticate users when entering words. The idea is to implement a process to examine the typing pattern as a user enters his/her password, in order to augment the conventional password system. We find the discrete first-order HMM to be very suitable for our purpose. Due to the nondeterministic nature of the keystroke events, modeling with a stochastic process such as the HMM which has probabilistic state transitions can not only recognize the patterns in the keys already typed, but also predict the following sequence. The issue is similar to the recognition of hand-written characters or spoken words. The experimental results are nearly perfect among twenty test subjects all randomly chosen in a controlled environment of a standard computer laboratory.","","0-7803-8819-4","10.1109/IRI.2004.1431505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1431505","","Hidden Markov models;Pattern analysis;Computer security;Authentication;Biometrics;Timing;Data mining;Predictive models;Stochastic processes;Pattern recognition","hidden Markov models;message authentication;biometrics (access control);pattern recognition","hidden Markov model;keystroke pattern analysis;password verification;user authentication process;biometric approach;stochastic process;probabilistic state transition;pattern recognition","","19","","18","IEEE","23 May 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Developers' misunderstanding or negligence of RFCs may bring in inconsistency bugs, which could further cause incorrect behaviors, interoperability issues, or critical security implications. Detecting such bugs is difficult as they usually result in silent erroneous effect. Prior work on RFC-directed inconsistency bug detection usually deal with a certain protocol or ad-hoc properties in RFCs. In this paper, we present RIBDetector, an approach focusing on statically and efficiently locating inconsistency bugs that could be triggered by hand-crafted network packets in protocol implementations. Given an implementation, its corresponding RFCs and a user-provided configuration file, our approach automatically extracts rules about packet format, state transition and error handling from RFCs into a uniform format which dictates condition checks that must be performed before taking particular operations. Then we leverage common programming conventions to identify corresponding locations of the conditions and operations in implementations and use a light-weight predominator-based algorithm to detect violations of RFC rules. We implemented a prototype of RIBDetector and demonstrated its efficacy by applying it on 14 implementations of 5 network protocols.

Prior works have shown that traffic attributes such as packet size combined with machine learning techniques enable the inference of private information from Internet of Things users. One of the commonly used techniques to mitigate those privacy threats is traffic obfuscation, such as packet padding. Most padding mechanisms that were previously proposed statically select the number of bytes inserted in the packets, which incurs high overhead and ineffective privacy improvement. These static mechanisms are particularly unsuitable for networks whose traffic patterns are significantly dynamic, such as smart homes. This article proposes an adaptive packet padding approach based on software-defined networking (SDN) that adjusts the number of bytes inserted into packets in response to variations in the home network utilization. The proposed technique monitors the network to instruct a padding mechanism through a representational state transfer (REST) interface proposed in this article. This mechanism ensures that the length of packets generated by connected devices is modified. The evaluation includes four supervised learning mechanisms, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and k-nearest neighbors (KNNs), to measure privacy improvement through the metrics accuracy, recall, and F1-score.

"IEEE Draft Standard for Biometric Privacy","",,"IEEE P2410/D3, November 2020","10 Nov 2020","2020","","","1","50","The Standard for Biometric Privacy (SBP) provides private identity assertion. SBP supersedes the prior IEEE Std 2410(TM)-2019 by including a formal specification for privacy and biometrics such that a conforming SBP system does not incur GDPR, CCPA, BIPA or HIPAA privacy obligations. Homomorphic encryption ensures the biometric payload is always one-way encrypted with no need for key management and provides full privacy by ensuring plaintext biometrics are never received by the SBP server. The SBP implementation includes software running on a client device and on the SPB server. Pluggable components are used to replace legacy functionality to allow rapid integration into existing operating environments. The SBP implementation allows the systems to meet security needs by using the application programming interface, whether the underlying system is a relational database management system or a search engine. The SBP implementation functionality offers a “point-and-cut” mechanism to add the appropriate security to the production systems as well as to the systems in development. The architecture is language neutral, allowing Representational State Transfer (REST ), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide the communication interface.

A normally operating high-voltage transmission network could approximately satisfy the linearization conditions so the ISFs remain constant. The existing ISFs calculation method is the DC approximations based on the branch reactance matrix. But this method has inherent drawbacks resulting in its inaccuracy in two aspects: (1) the parameters of power system elements are hard to acquire accurately because of parameter offset as operation states change; (2) we need to set a reference node to balance the power flow, but the setting is often inconsistent with the real balance strategy. In the above context, we propose a measurement-based estimation method which uses robust least-squares estimation and SCADA measurement data to calculate the ISFs. The effectiveness of the method is verified by comparing the ISFs got from the measurement-based robust estimation with the ones got from DC approximations and the ordinary least-squares estimation (LSE).","","978-1-4799-5032-4","10.1109/POWERCON.2014.6993679","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993679","Injection shift factors;Least-squares estimation;Robust least-squares estimation;SCADA measurement data","Estimation;Transmission line measurements;Transmission line matrix methods;Load flow;Approximation methods;Robustness","estimation theory;least squares approximations;load flow;power generation scheduling;power system management;power system measurement;power system security;transmission networks","measurement-based estimation method;injection shift factors;ISF calculation method;real-time scheduling;security check;congestion management;high-voltage transmission network;linearization conditions;branch reactance matrix;power system elements;power flow;least-squares estimation;SCADA measurement data","","","","16","IEEE","22 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different mitigation techniques have been proposed in the literature that aims to mitigate these attacks by randomizing the address to cache location mappings. The security guarantees in these schemes are based on the degree of difficulty for an attacker to reliably determine the cache lines accessed by the victim within practical time settings. However, prior attacks have shown that newer and more improved algorithms can be envisaged that discover conflicting sets in the secured randomized caches. In this work, we first categorize different types of cache designs into four broad classes based on the extent of non-determinism and randomness of allocating an address in those caches. We then develop a mathematical framework to formally analyse the security implications of the randomized and partitioned cache designs in terms of collision probability, self-collision probability and size of the eviction set required to perform a successful eviction-based attack. We further empirically demonstrate set associative eviction on recently proposed randomization schemes called Mirage and Scattercache. Next, we propose two algorithms to generate efficient eviction set on these schemes and analytically evaluate the efficacy of our algorithms against the one proposed in the literature. Finally, we argue that mere randomization using a cryptographic primitive as used in popular schemes like Scattercache, CEASER-S, Mirage etc. does not provide the required randomness. Although the randomized-partitioned caches provide some resilience against eviction-set generation techniques, they are still vulnerable to eviction-based attacks.","2378-203X","978-1-6654-7652-2","10.1109/HPCA56546.2023.10071041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10071041","","Microarchitecture;Cache memory;Side-channel attacks;Computer architecture;Signal generators;Partitioning algorithms;Reliability","cache storage;cryptography;probability","cache based side-channel attacks;cache lines;cache location mappings;CEASER-S;conflicting sets;cryptographic primitive;eviction-based attacks;eviction-set generation techniques;mathematical framework;mere randomization;microarchitectural state changes;Mirage;mitigation techniques;partitioned cache designs;randomized cache designs;randomized-partitioned caches;Scattercache;self-collision probability;shared cache memory","","","","34","IEEE","24 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, the UWA channel is under impersonation attack by a malicious node (Eve) present in the close vicinity of the legitimate node pair (Alice and Bob); Eve tries to inject its malicious data into the system by making Bob believe that she is indeed Alice. To thwart the impersonation attack by Eve, Bob utilizes the distance of the transmit node as the feature/fingerprint to carry out feature-based authentication at the physical layer. Due to authentication at Bob, due to lack of channel knowledge at the transmit node (Alice or Eve), and due to the threshold-based decoding error model, the relevant dynamics of the considered system could be modelled by a Markov chain (MC). Thus, we compute the state-transition probabilities of the MC, and the moment generating function for the service process corresponding to each state. This enables us to derive a closed-form expression of the EC in terms of authentication parameters. Furthermore, we compute the optimal transmission rate (at Alice) through gradient-descent (GD) technique and artificial neural network (ANN) method. Simulation results show that the EC decreases under severe authentication constraints (i.e., more false alarms and more transmissions by Eve). Simulation results also reveal that the (optimal transmission rate) performance of the ANN technique is quite close to that of the GTJ method.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-5089-5","10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9149395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149395","Effective capacity;authentication;underwater acoustic;quality-of-service;artificial neural networks","Kuiper belt","channel coding;gradient methods;Markov processes;neural nets;probability;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;underwater acoustic communication;wireless channels","malicious data;impersonation attack;feature-based authentication;state-transition probabilities;underwater acoustic channel;UWA channel;malicious node;authentication constraints;threshold-based decoding error model;Markov chain;gradient-descent technique;artificial neural network;GTJ method","","7","","29","IEEE","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Virtual machines are becoming increasing popular for deploying servers because they allow checkpointing and live migration facilities. The challenges are dealing with non-virtual state elements, like ongoing network communications that can't be check-pointed, and recovering state changed between failure and the last check-point. Other complications include dependence on human intervention and precise timing so as not to revert to an un-healthy VM already in the state of compromise. This paper describes a Xen based middleware that pervasively detects terminated VM servers and reincarnates them in a safe state such that they don't lose connectivity to their network clients. It also attempts to isolate messages that caused the failure and generates rules to disallow them from effecting the newly reincarnated VM in the future. Since it essentially allows a VM to start a new life from a point in time before it got compromised, we dubbed it: a time-forking virtual machine (TFVM) following the Copenhagen school's ""many worlds theory"" that postulates that every historical event forks a new universe for every possible outcome. Currently TFVM works in the context of our particular application but we discuss how to extend our model to allow reincarnation of generalized services","","0-7695-2788-4","10.1109/PERCOMW.2007.103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4144882","","Virtual machining;Virtual manufacturing;Web server;Network servers;Mission critical systems;Telecommunications;Internet;Checkpointing;Humans;Timing","Internet telephony;middleware;telecommunication security;virtual machines","reincarnation security;Xen based time-forking virtual machines;mission-critical telecom servers;Internet;VoIP;nonvirtual state elements;human intervention;Xen based middleware;many worlds theory","","","1","10","IEEE","2 Apr 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sequential logic locking, watermark insertion, fault-injection assessment of a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) control flow, information leakage assessment, and reverse engineering at gate-level abstraction, to name a few, require precise FSM extraction from the synthesized netlist of the design. Unfortunately, no reliable solutions are currently available for fast and accurate extraction of FSMs from the highly unstructured gate-level netlist for effective security evaluation. The major challenge in developing such a solution is precise recognition of FSM state flip-flops in a netlist having a massive collection of flip-flops. In this paper, we propose FSMx-Ultra, a framework for extracting FSMs from extremely unstructured gate-level netlists. FSMx-Ultra utilizes state-of-the-art graph theory concepts and algorithms to distinguish FSM state registers from other registers and then constructs gate-level state transition graphs (STGs) for each identified FSM state register using automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) techniques. The results of our experiments on 14 open-source benchmark designs illustrate that FSMx-Ultra can recover all FSMs quickly and precisely from synthesized gate-level netlists of diverse complexity and size utilizing various state encoding schemes.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2023.3266368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10098877","FSM Automata Theory;FSM Extraction;Netlist Analysis;Security Assessment","Logic gates;Registers;Security;Encoding;Automata;Data mining;Flip-flops","","","","","","","IEEE","11 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Several protocols and security mechanisms have been proposed to ensure primary security features such as confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non repudiation. However, ensuring the correctness of these protocols is crucial in ensuring user confidence in system security. Therefore, these protocols need to be verified in some formal sense that involves an exhaustive examination of the protocol flow and its state transitions.

Specifically, we modeled silent cyber risk by focusing on state transitions to different risks. We newly defined two types of silent cyber risk, namely, Alteration risk and Combination risk, and conducted risk assessment. Our assessment identified 23 risk factors, and after analyzing them, we found that all of them were classified as Risk Transference. We clarified that the most effective risk countermeasure for Alteration risk was insurance and for Combination risk was measures to reduce the impact of the risk factors themselves.

A large number of applications relate to cellular and mobile telephony, pagers, local area networks, cordless phones, global positioning systems, and security systems. Pseudo-SAW (PSAW) and more recently the High Velocity Pseudo-SAW (HVPSAW) have received a great deal of attention due to their high phase velocities, and therefore the high frequencies of operation these modes may provide. In addition to high phase velocities, the pseudo-modes must also present low propagation losses and considerably high electromechanical coupling coefficients to be considered for practical devices. This paper verifies that the metallic layer thickness is a relevant SAW device parameter in order to achieve lower losses, for high frequency, high electromechanical coupling, low loss SAW devices. Popular PSAW and HVPSAW material orientations such as 64/spl deg/ YX LiNbO/sub 3/(0/spl deg/ 26/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), 36/spl deg/ YX LiTaO/sub 3/ (0/spl deg/-54/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), LiNbO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 36/spl deg/), LiTaO/sub 3/ (90/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/ 31/spl deg/), quartz ST-X (0/spl deg/ 132.75/spl deg/ 0/spl deg/), Li/sub 2/B/sub 4/O/sub 7/ (0/spl deg/ 45/spl deg/ 90/spl deg/), among others, are considered. In addition to the lower losses and the dispersion analysis for the pseudo modes, the present work discusses the transitions with layer thickness from HVPSAWs to higher order PSAWs modes, and the transitions from PSAWs to the generalized SAWs (GSAWs) modes. Besides contributing to the knowledge of the pseudo-modes behavior with layer thickness, this mode transition analysis enlightens the situation where the losses in the pseudo modes go to zero, due to the merging of the pseudo modes into the GSAWs. The fact that as a function of thickness the GSAWs are a natural continuation for the pseudo modes may be conveniently used in the fabrication of low loss devices. For completeness the effects of heavy layer metals, such as gold, in reducing the layer thickness where the pseudo modes merge to the GSAWs are discussed. Numerical results are compared to some experimental data available in the literature, and the present analysis elucidates experimentally observed higher order pseudo modes, and values of layer thickness where lower losses are achieved.","1051-0117","0-7803-4153-8","10.1109/ULTSYM.1997.663018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=663018","","Surface acoustic wave devices;Frequency;Performance loss;Cellular networks;Telephony;Local area networks;Propagation losses;Merging;Fabrication;Gold","surface acoustic wave devices;surface acoustic wave devices;surface acoustic wave devices;surface acoustic wave devices;electromechanical effects;electromechanical effects;electromechanical effects;electromechanical effects;lithium compounds;lithium compounds;lithium compounds;quartz","layer thickness;GSAW devices;PSAW devices;HVPSAW devices;SAW device design;low loss;high performance;high frequency operation;pseudo-SAW device;high velocity pseudo-SAW device;high phase velocities;low propagation losses;high electromechanical coupling coefficients;metallic layer thickness;SAW device parameter;LiNbO/sub 3/;LiTaO/sub 3/;quartz;Li/sub 2/B/sub 4/O/sub 7/;dispersion analysis;mode transition analysis;low loss devices;gold;SiO/sub 2/;Au","","5","","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to organize and locate roaming devices, a decentralized peer-to-peer overlay is developed. To provide location transparency for application developers and enable efficient data sharing among application components, an API is provided that hides whether shared memory or latency optimized network distribution is used to share data. The problem of open TCP connections to third-party applications is solved with a proxy-based approach. Multimedia applications are especially sensitive to service interruptions that can be caused by migration, and a new approach for check-pointing, state transfer, and resuming an application with minimal freeze time is therefore introduced. The evaluation of TRAMP shows that this optimization for low freeze time has significant effect. For example, migrating the Skype video-conferencing application with TRAMP reduces the average freeze time from 41.1 seconds with legacy approaches to 213 milliseconds. Further results from the empirical evaluation of TRAMP demonstrate that it has no negative impact on the Quality of Experience.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2017.2688421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7888504","Mobile applications;mobile computing;ubiquitous computing;multimedia communication;middleware","Multimedia communication;Mobile computing;Real-time systems;Multimedia computing;Middleware;Mobile communication","application program interfaces;mobile computing;multimedia communication;overlay networks;peer-to-peer computing;telecommunication security;transport protocols","mobile computing;ubiquitous computing;multimedia application components;third-party applications;Skype video-conferencing application;average freeze time;TRAMP real-time application mobility platform;decentralized peer-to-peer overlay;data sharing;API;open TCP connection;proxy-based approach;check-pointing approach;state transfer approach;optimization;quality of experience;time 41.1 s;time 213.0 ms","","3","","30","IEEE","28 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There exist a manifold of different reasons for system failures of devices starting from short-circuits, hardware defects or malware infections reaching to power shortages or complete blackouts. Moreover, the increase of the number of devices within the airport infrastructure system leads to a tremendous demand of computational assistance systems for operations management. As most devices within the airport are directly connected to processes, there is a high demand for identifying and managing system failures immediately and increase the system resilience. Thus, we introduce process-oriented-grouping of network devices and use linear algebra to relate the impact of system state changes to airport processes, such as check-in, security checks et cetera. This connection between system state and processes is inevitable for a successful combination of computational approaches to determine physical state variations, induced by power grid instabilities and/or cyber-attacks, and process oriented simulation methods. Matrix relations between system states, process capacities, waiting times are given and applied to a small, at this state fictional airport infrastructure. This application shows that forecasting of quantitative values for airport processes is a beneficial tool for airport infrastructure management. Moreover, linear algebra properties prove to be a strong tool in analyzing network properties, such as infrastructure diversity and process capacities, which play a major role within resource management. However, at the moment our approach is only suitable as a supporting tool for human decision making. Nevertheless the approach can be enhanced as intelligent health monitoring system for airports.","2155-4951","978-1-7281-1893-2","10.1109/ICNSURV.2019.8735110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735110","","Airports;Security;Process control;Linear algebra;Standards;Tools;Resource management","airports;invasive software;linear algebra;power grids","process-oriented-grouping;resource management;airport operation;short-circuits;hardware defects;malware infections;power shortages;airport infrastructure system;computational assistance systems;power grid instabilities;airport infrastructure management;linear algebra properties;intelligent health monitoring system;operation management","","1","","12","IEEE","13 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, current methods for detecting attacks are not sufficiently accurate and no methods can provide attack mitigation. To ensure vehicle ABS security, we propose an attack detection method to accurately detect both sensor attack and CAN bus attack in a vehicle ABS, and an attack mitigation strategy to mitigate their negative effects on the vehicle ABS. In our attack detection method, we build a vehicle state space equation which considers real-time road friction coefficient to predict vehicle states (i.e., wheel speed and longitudinal brake force) with their previous values. Based on sets of historical measured vehicle states, we develop a search algorithm to find out attack changes (vehicle state changes because of the attack) by minimizing errors between predicted vehicle states and measured vehicle states. In our attack mitigation strategy, attack changes are subtracted from measured vehicle states to generate correct vehicle states for the vehicle ABS. We conducted first real sensor attack experiments to show how a magnet affects sensor readings. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack detection method can detect sensor attack and CAN bus attack more accurately compared with existing methods, and also our attack mitigation strategy almost eliminates attack's effects on the vehicle ABS.","2637-9430","978-1-7281-6607-0","10.1109/ICCCN49398.2020.9209645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9209645","CAN bus attack;Sensor attack;Attack detection and mitigation;Vehicle ABS","Brakes;Force;Wheels;Hydraulic systems;Real-time systems;Roads;Friction","brakes;braking;controller area networks;field buses;search problems;sensors","vehicle state prediction;attack mitigation strategy;sensor attack experiments;attack detection method;CAN bus attacks;controller area network bus;vehicle ABS security;vehicle state space equation;vehicle antilock braking systems;driving direction control;real-time road friction coefficient;search algorithm","","2","","24","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally it is used in households as an over current circuit breaker to ensure safety from electrical hazards like outrageous fire accidents arising from electrical short circuit. These kinds of electrical hazards occur because the amperage of these circuit breakers are fixed and we cannot change the tripping current anytime to endure the newly added or removed electrical loads. This paper reports the experimental realization of a numerical overcurrent relay using, primarily, a microcontroller and a micro current transformer (CT) which is compatible with smart grid technology and high voltage system like electric vehicle. In this newly designed numerical over current relay (NOCR) the user can change the set current and the sensitivity of the system just by twisting two different knobs. Thus this system ensures advance security against electrical hazards than a normal MCB. It will obtain, trial and covert analog current signals hooked on digital form of a power system in real time. Solid state switch (MOSFET switch) has been opted as circuit breaker in order to enhance system effectivity. This newly designed system can detect a fault or over current with 100% accuracy and the operating time (OT) calculated by this relay is 99.57% responsive to the theoretical calculation.

Moreover, to improve the accuracy of voltage stability assessment (VSA), the influence on LIMM of voltage characteristics of static ZIP load is considered while calculating LIMM. Based on the above, an improved optimization model of VSC-OPF is established, which greatly reduces the time for updating VSC-OPF results to improve its ability to adapt to mode changes of the power system.

The only proper way to protect a smart contract is to fix potential risks in its code before it is deployed to the blockchain. However, existing tools for smart contract security analysis focus on the detection of bugs but seldom consider the code fix issues. Meanwhile, it is often time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to understand and fix flawed code manually. In this paper we propose SMARTSHIELD, a bytecode rectification system, to fix three typical security-related bugs (i.e., state changes after external calls, missing checks for out-of-bound arithmetic operations, and missing checks for failing external calls) in smart contracts automatically and help developers release secure contracts. Moreover, SMARTSHIELD guarantees that the rectified contract is not only immune to certain attacks but also gas-friendly (i.e., a slightly increase of gas cost). To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of SMARTSHIELD, we applied it to 28,621 real-world buggy contracts on Ethereum blockchain (as of January 2nd2019). Experiment results demonstrated that among 95,502 insecure cases in those contracts, 87,346 (91.5%) of them were automatically fixed by SMARTSHIELD. A following test with both program analysis and real-world exploits further testified that the rectified contracts were secure against common attacks. Moreover, the rectification only introduced a 0.2 % gas increment for each contract on average.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-5143-4","10.1109/SANER48275.2020.9054825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9054825","Ethereum blockchain;Smart contract;Automated bug fix;Bytecode rectification","Codes;Costs;Smart contracts;Computer bugs;Semantics;Transforms;Software","contracts;cryptography;distributed databases;program debugging","security response mechanisms;smart contract security analysis;Ethereum blockchain;real-world buggy contracts;rectified contract;secure contracts;security-related bugs;bytecode rectification system;flawed code;code fix issues;code patching;automatic smart contract protection;SMARTSHIELD","","25","","68","IEEE","2 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Detection and self-protection against viruses, worms, and network attacks is urgently needed to protect network systems and their applications from catastrophic failures. Once a network component is infected by viruses, worms, or became a target of network attacks, its operational state shifts from normal to abnormal state. Online monitoring mechanism can collect important aspects of network traffic and host data (CPU utilization, memory usage, etc.), that can be effectively used to detect abnormal behaviors caused by attacks. In this paper, we develop an online multivariate analysis algorithm to analyze the behaviors of system resources and network protocols in order to proactively detect network attacks.

Although regular expressions offer superior expressive ability and flexibility, application protocols are described by regular expression manually based on sufficiently understanding protocol itself. At present there is not an effect method to realize classification, recognition and control automatically for the known applications and the unknown applications in future. In this paper a novel approach is presented to model network application specification. In this work, the whole automatic protocol reverse engineering is realized through accomplishing the protocol state machine, and then the FSMs are translated to corresponding regular expressions to enrich and update the pattern database.

Multi-state system usually has multiple normal states, and state changes at unpredictable points caused by the daily operation such as feed, outlet, flow control, etc. For the multistate system, collecting enough data that contain all possible states are challenging or impossible to users. Furthermore, conventional anomaly detection methods are sensitive to the context of training datasets or the unpredicted phased changes of the testing datasets, or just consider the local density of the testing samples. Motivated by this problem, we transform the model learning problem to a distinction learning problem that learns the familiarity of each testing samples. In order to reduce the effects of the phased changes, we randomly shuffle the testing dataset and use a sliding window to evaluate the familiarity of the testing samples with one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) method.

The state transitions are managed by added signals that may come from various triggers depending on the target application. We devise an algorithm for implementing the N-variant IC design. We discuss the necessary manipulations of the added signals that would facilitate the various tasks. The key advantage to integrating the heterogeneity in the functional specification of the design is that we can configure the variants during or post-manufacturing, but removal, extraction or deletion of the variants is not viable. Experimental results on benchmark circuits demonstrate that the method can be automatically and efficiently implemented.

Asymmetric information games are particularly relevant for security problems, e.g., where an attacker knows its own skill set or alternatively a system administrator knows the state of its resources. In such settings, the informed player is faced with the tradeoff of exploiting its superior information at the cost of revealing its superior information. This tradeoff is typically addressed through randomization, in an effort to keep the uninformed player informationally off balance. A lingering issue is the explicit computation of such strategies. This paper, building on prior work for repeated games, presents an LP formulation to compute suboptimal strategies for the informed player in discounted asymmetric information stochastic games in which state transitions are not affected by the uninformed player. Furthermore, the paper presents bounds between the security level guaranteed by the sub-optimal strategy and the optimal value.

In recent years, blockchain technology has been introduced as a panacea to our security problems, including that of authentication, without sufficient reasoning, as to its merits.In this work, we investigate the merits of using open distributed ledgers (ODLs), such as the one implemented by blockchain technology, for securing TM systems for authentication. We formally model such systems, and explore how blockchain can help mitigate attacks against them. After formal argumentation, we conclude that in the context of Trust Management for authentication, blockchain technology, and ODLs in general, can offer considerable advantages compared to previous approaches. Our analysis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to formally model and argue about the security of TM systems for authentication, based on blockchain technology. To achieve this result, we first provide an abstract model for TM systems for authentication. Then, we show how this model can be conceptually encoded in a blockchain, by expressing it as a series of state transitions. As a next step, we examine five prevalent attacks on TM systems, and provide evidence that blockchain-based solutions can be beneficial to the security of such systems, by mitigating, or completely negating such attacks.","2324-9013","978-1-5090-4906-6","10.1109/Trustcom/BigDataSE/ICESS.2017.283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029486","Trust Management for authentication;blockchain technology;formal modeling;attacks and defences","Authentication;Public key;Electronic mail;Bitcoin;Organizations","interactive systems;trusted computing;ubiquitous computing","trust management;authentication;TM systems;online interactions security;ubiquitous system;Web of Trust;blockchain technology;open distributed ledgers;ODL","","43","1","50","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multiple-stride deterministic finite automaton (DFA) increases the performance of pattern matching, because they allow multiple bytes of a packet to be scanned simultaneously. However, traditional multiple-stride DFA either rely on specific hardware for parallel comparison or have a huge memory requirements due to state explosion. In this paper, we present a high throughput, multiple-stride pattern-matching architecture that requires a small storage cost and no specific hardware. The basic idea is to group DFA states/transitions into three coarse-grained and variable-size blocks, so that each individual block can employ different-specific methods to optimize storage requirements and performance. The blocks are naturally identified based on basic observations of DFA characteristics: prefix, linear trie and state dependencies. The performance evaluation is done using the Snort pattern sets. We show that multi-byte striding DFA achieves multi Gb/s pure content inspection in software, while utilizing <3 bytes per pattern character.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxq077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8130271","pattern matching;memory and performance optimization;deep packet inspection;network security","","","","","5","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Notable examples are DDoS attacks on Krebs on Security and DYN, which have been performed by IoT devices part of botnets. We take a first step towards detecting P2P botnets in IoT, by proposing AutoBotCatcher, whose design is driven by the consideration that bots of the same botnet frequently communicate with each other and form communities. As such, the purpose of AutoBotCatcher is to dynamically analyze communities of IoT devices, formed according to their network traffic flows, to detect botnets. AutoBotCatcher exploits a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain, as a state transition machine that allows collaboration of multiple parties without trust, in order to perform collaborative and dynamic botnet detection by collecting and auditing IoT devices' network traffic flows as blockchain transactions.

Accordingly, a myriad of dynamic mitigation devices have been proposed in the last few decades where these devices are installed at strategic points in the grid. Transformer-less power electronics-based modules, integrated between the neutral and substation ground of traditional transformers, have been proposed introducing a variety of advanced grid mitigation and support features; DC elimination, voltage regulation, voltage and impedance balancing, harmonics isolation and power flow control. However, the protection of these series-connected modules against high voltage development during ground faults or inrush currents is critical as it could damage these converter-based mitigation devices or exceed the transformer BIL rating, thus, severely threatening the energy security.

EPS was designed assuming high speed real-time bulk multimedia data transfer; so initial cost of bearer setup signaling for user plane data is justified. However, this basic assumption is changed due to very small and infrequent background data transfer by the smartphone's always-on applications most of the time when smartphone is not in active use. To transmit this background data, UE incurs frequent idle to connected state transitions and require costly disproportionate signaling overhead for EPS bearer and Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection setup/release procedure. This paper presents a connectionless transmission (CLT) scheme for efficient exchange of background data without establishing the EPS bearer and RRC connection. In the proposed CLT scheme, the data packets are made self-sustainable by carrying routing information in the packet's header. These self-sustained packets are carried through modified Random Access Channel (RACH) procedure between the UE and the eNodeB. Further, another novel aspect of the CLT scheme is to establish common user plane bearers between the radio access network and packet gateways in the core network, to forward self-sustain data packets using the routing information. Our simulation results show CLT scheme reduces the signaling overhead significantly compared to the traditional connection oriented transmission.","1938-1883","978-1-4799-2003-7","10.1109/ICC.2014.6883692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6883692","","Security;Context;Mobile communication;Data transfer;Wireless communication;IP networks","IP networks;multimedia communication;radio equipment;radio networks;telecommunication signalling;wireless channels","efficient data transmission method;evolved packet system;EPS;flat-IP architecture;connection oriented system;logical bearers;user equipment;UE;core network;real-time bulk multimedia data transfer;setup signaling;infrequent background data transfer;radio resource control;connectionless transmission;CLT;random access channel;RACH procedure;eNodeB;packet gateways;radio access network;plane bearers;connection oriented transmission","","","4","11","IEEE","28 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a tracking system using only a single AP. The insight behind the proposed system is to mine the multi-dimensional channel parameters from the direct path to realize tracking. Therefore, we develop a model that establishes the correlation between the target motion and channel parameters, including the direct path's angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD). Then, we can formulate the tracking problem as the state transition with the observations. Since the nonlinear observation equation, we use particle filters to solve the problem accurately. Finally, we validate the proposed system via simulation using ray-tracing software. The simulation results show that the median tracking error is 0.21 m based on a 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), comparable to previous state-of-the-art systems.","2166-9589","978-1-6654-8053-6","10.1109/PIMRC54779.2022.9977459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9977459","Indoor tracking;single access point;wireless channel model;direct path;particle filter","Wireless communication;Target tracking;Simulation;Ray tracing;Mathematical models;Software;Indoor environment","direction-of-arrival estimation;image motion analysis;indoor radio;Kalman filters;multipath channels;particle filtering (numerical methods);radiowave propagation;ray tracing;target tracking;tracking;wireless LAN","complex indoor environment;decimeter level indoor tracking;direct path;elaborately selected multipaths;elderly care;median tracking error;multidimensional channel parameters;multiple access points;noise figure 20.0 dB;nonlinear observation equation;previous state-of-the-art systems;security monitoring;single access point;single AP;size 0.21 m;target motion;tracking problem;tracking region;tracking system;unexpected interferences","","","","10","IEEE","20 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

That is, they protect Trusted Applications (TAs) even if the Operating System or the hypervisor are compromised. The TEE runs in parallel with the OS and leverages a set of hardware and software components to create such an isolated environment. However, this isolation can be broken by exploiting microarchitectural side-channels. The state of the shared components of multi-core processors depends on the actual processes being executed, and as a result, some information is leaked from one process to any other running in the same processor. This leakage completely breaks the confidentiality guarantees that TEEs promise. The only way to completely avoid the leakage is to avoid the share of resources, but this is nearly impossible to achieve without a huge degradation in the performance of the processor. Assuming that it is possible that the leakage exists, and the attacker only can get information from the observable microarchitectural state, we propose to monitor the hardware resources to detect the microarchitectural state changes caused by the attacks. To this end, we have implemented a hardware module that compares at runtime pre-stored microarchitectural execution signatures of each enclave, with the actual execution trace, and triggers an alarm when it detects significant variation.","2640-5563","978-1-7281-9132-4","10.1109/DCIS51330.2020.9268660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268660","Microarchitectural attacks;CUSUM;DTW;TEE;Performance Counters","Hardware;Microarchitecture;Program processors;Security;Monitoring;Registers;VHDL","data protection;digital signatures;operating systems (computers);program diagnostics;resource allocation;trusted computing","microarchitectural isolation guarantees;confidentiality;trusted applications;operating system;microarchitectural side channels;multicore processors;execution trace;trusted execution environments;microarchitectural execution signatures;hypervisor;parallel TEE;information leakage","","","","35","IEEE","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The verification problem in grsecurity presents much of the complexity of modern RBAC systems, due to the presence of policy state changes that may arise both from explicit administrative primitives supported by grsecurity, and as the result of the interaction with the underlying operating system facilities. We develop a formal semantics for grsecurity's RBAC system, based on a labelled transition system, and a sound abstraction of that semantics providing a bounded approximation, amenable to model checking.

Their flexibility, however, increases the complexity of the detection system and often limits the detection speed as well as the total number of RegExes that can be detected using limited resources. The two classical detection methods, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) and Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), have the potential problems of prohibitively large memory requirements and a large number of concurrent operations, respectively. Although recent schemes addressing these problems to improve DFA and NFA are promising, they are inherently limited by their scalability, since they follow the state transition model in DFA and NFA, where the state transitions occur per each character of the input. We recently proposed a scalable RegEx detection system called Lookahead Finite Automata (LaFA) to solve these problems with three novel ideas: 1. Provide specialized and optimized detection modules to increase resource utilizations. 2. Systematically reordering the RegEx detection sequence to reduce number of concurrent operations. 3. Sharing states among automata for different RegExes to reduce resource requirements. In this paper, we propose an efficient hardware architecture and prototype design implementation based on LaFA. Our proof-of-concept prototype design is built on a fraction of a single commodity Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chip and can accommodate up to twenty-five thousand (25k) RegExes. Using only 7% of the logic area and 25% of the memory on a Xilinx Virtex-4 FX100, the prototype design can achieve 2-Gbps (gigabits-per-second) detection throughput with only one detection engine. We estimate that 34-Gbps detection throughput can be achieved if the entire resources of a state-of-the-art FPGA chip are used to implement multiple detection engines.","","978-1-4244-6534-7","10.1109/IPDPSW.2010.5470750","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470750","","Hardware;Automata;Doped fiber amplifiers;Prototypes;Field programmable gate arrays;Throughput;Engines;Scalability;Resource management;Programmable logic arrays","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;optimisation;security of data","hardware implementation;scalable lookahead regular expression detection;RegExes;detection system complexity;deterministic finite automaton;DFA;nondeterministic finite automaton;NFA;prototype design implementation;field programmable gate array;FPGA","","3","","28","IEEE","24 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, they are resource-constrained and connected via lossy links. This paper addresses the optimized scheduling of the monitoring role between the embedded devices in IoT networks. The objective is to minimize energy consumption and communication overhead of monitoring, for each node. Several subsets of the potential monitoring nodes are generated by solving a minimal vertex cover (VC) problem with constraint generation. Assuming periodical functioning, VCs are optimally assigned to time periods in order to distribute the monitoring role throughout the entire network. The assignment of VCs to periods is modeled as a multiobjective generalized assignment problem. To further optimize the energy consumption of the monitors, they are sequenced across time periods to minimize the state transitions of nodes. This part of the problem is modeled as a traveling salesman path problem. The proposed model is tested on randomly generated instances and the experimental results illustrate its effectiveness to optimize the scheduled monitoring for fault tolerance in IoT networks.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2792326","Academy of Scientific Research and Technology; French Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Granting the Imhotep Project MONIOT(grant numbers:33124VJ); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254334","Energy-efficient monitoring;generalized assignment problem (GAP);Internet of Things (IoT);robustness;scheduling;traveling salesman path (TSP) problem;vertex cover (VC)","Monitoring;Wireless sensor networks;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Routing;Energy consumption;Internet of Things","computer network security;fault tolerance;Internet;Internet of Things;optimisation;scheduling;travelling salesman problems","traveling salesman path problem;scheduled monitoring;IoT networks;energy-efficient multiobjective scheduling model;wireless networks;critical applications;security risks;lossy links;optimized scheduling;energy consumption;potential monitoring nodes;minimal vertex cover problem;constraint generation;multiobjective generalized assignment problem;VC problem","","20","","48","IEEE","11 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A previously developed Markov-chain based model is refined into an interdependent Markov chain model to capture the role of cyber threat from the communication network and the human-operator error during cascading failures. The state transitions of the Markov chain are parameterized by the critical operating parameters of the power grid. The calculations assume a generic form of correlation between the level of and damage from cyber-attacks, on the one hand, and the level of interdependence on the other hand. The model finds the optimal level of interdependence, i.e., the trade-off between well-informed control and vulnerability to attacks that minimizes the probability of massive cascading failures in power grids.

However, existing side-channel approaches suffer from large reduction in detection sensitivity with increasing process variations or decreasing Trojan size. In this paper, we propose TeSR, a Temporal Self-Referencing approach that compares the current signature of a chip at two different time windows to completely eliminate the effect of process noise, thus providing high detection sensitivity for Trojans of varying size. Furthermore, unlike existing approaches, it does not require golden chip instances as a reference.

In particular, concealment mechanisms must modify well-known data structures, which could be detected trivially otherwise. We argue that any such mechanism is necessarily non-atomic and can hence be detected through concurrent observations forcing an interleaved linearization of the malicious code with observations of memory state changes induced in tightly coupled concurrent processing units. Extending previous research for the case of symmetric concurrent observation, we propose a computational model and observation mechanism for the case of tightly coupled asymmetric concurrent processing units as may be found in most current computing environments with particular emphasis on metrics for the cost of forced synchronization and resource contention caused by observations. We argue that the resulting observations will provide a novel sensor datum for intrusion detection but may also be used as a standalone probabilistic detection mechanism particularly suited to detect attacks in progress.","","978-1-4244-6232-2","10.1109/ICONS.2010.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5464146","Intrusion Detection;Computational Model;Asymmetric Concurrency;Memory Observation","Costs;Concurrent computing;Kernel;Interference;Computational modeling;Monitoring;Computer architecture;Information security;Data structures;Intrusion detection","concurrency control;data structures;invasive software","observation mechanism;cost model;tightly coupled asymmetric concurrency;malicious code;second-order operation;privilege escalation;concealment mechanism;data structures;concurrent observations;interleaved linearization;concurrent processing units;computational model;forced synchronization;resource contention","","3","","19","IEEE","13 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, radio frequency (RF) fingerprint-based identification schemes have attracted wide attention as they extract the inherent characteristics of hardware circuits which is very hard to forge. However, existing RF fingerprint-based approaches face the problems of unstable region of interest (ROI), high-cost feature design, and incomplete automation. To address these problems, this paper proposes a multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN) to extract RF fingerprint from the selected ROI for classifying ZigBee devices. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) adaptive ROI selection algorithm is also developed to alleviate the effect of semi-steady behavior of ZigBee devices owing to sleep mode switching. The proposed MSCNN uses multiple downsampling transformations for multiscale feature extraction and classification automatically. To validate and evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we design a testbed consisting of one low-cost universal software radio peripheral (USRP) as the receiver and 54 CC2530 devices as targets for identification. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MSCNN both in the line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. The classification accuracy is as high as 97% under the LOS scenarios around SNR = 30 dB. Our scheme is robust over a wide range of SNRs under the LOS scenarios as well as under the NLOS scenarios.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2911347","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571110,61602113,61601114); National Natural Science Youth Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801115); Purple Mountain Laboratories (PML); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8692418","Multisampling convolutional neural network (MSCNN);radio frequency (RF) fingerprint;region of interest (ROI) selection;semi-steady portion;ZigBee","Feature extraction;Radio frequency;Zigbee;Internet of Things;Signal to noise ratio;Performance evaluation;Receivers","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;Internet of Things;signal classification;software radio;Zigbee","multiscale feature extraction;low-cost universal software radio peripheral;MSCNN;LOS scenarios;robust RF fingerprinting approach;multisampling convolutional neural network;device identification;radio frequency fingerprint-based identification schemes;hardware circuits;high-cost feature design;ZigBee devices;ROI selection algorithm;semisteady behavior;unstable region of interest;RF fingerprint-based approaches;signal-to-noise ratio adaptive ROI selection algorithm;downsampling transformations","","83","","58","IEEE","16 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, their complex signaling procedures and limited soft capacity made them vulnerable to new denial-of-service (DoS) attacks involving the control plane. More importantly, this type of frauds can also affect the successors of the 3G and their related paradigms such as smart cities. In this paper, we deeply examine the considerable signaling load of the IDLE-DCH state transitions that can be exploited by malicious entities to launch signaling DoS attacks. Besides, we investigate some state-of-art techniques proposed to combat the signaling attacks. A comparative analysis between these solutions has been conducted with regard to three pertinent criteria: cost, efficiency and overhead. The summary of results indicates that even though the randomization experiences some flaws related to the radio channel consumption, it presents the most optimal cost and overhead compared to the remaining solutions. This study opens up a new horizon for more secure 3G systems based on the randomization defense mechanisms.","2327-1884","978-1-5090-0751-6","10.1109/CIST.2016.7805009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7805009","3G;Signaling;DoS Attack;Security","Computer crime;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;IP networks;Internet;Smart cities","3G mobile communication;computer network security;wireless channels","protection mechanisms;DoS attacks;3G mobile networks;smart phone;denial-of-service attacks;smart cities;IDLE-DCH;radio channel","","3","","26","IEEE","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It allows the inspection of packet payload using patterns. Modern DPI based systems use regular expressions to define these patterns. Deterministic finite automata (DFA) is considered to be an ideal choice for performing regular expression matching due to its O(1) processing complexity. However, DFAs consume large memory to store its state transition table, but this problem gets worsened when stride level of the DFA is increased. Though, increasing stride level brings significant increase in the overall speedup of the matching engine but as a trade off it consumes large memory. In this paper, we present stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching (SPPM), a technique in which a packet is first split up into two chunks and then multiple bytes per chunk are inspected at a time using stride-k DFA. Furthermore, we present a stride-k DFA compression technique using alphabet compression table (ACT) to reduce the memory requirements of stride-k DFA. We have implemented the single threaded algorithm for stride-2 SPPM. Results show that the use of stride-2 SPPM can overall increase the pattern matching speed by up to 30% as compared to traditional DFA matching, and a significant reduction of over 70% in the number iterations required for packet processing. Secondly, over 65% reduction in the number of transitions has been achieved using ACT for stride-2 DFA implementation.","","978-1-4799-7981-3","10.1109/CSE.2014.125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023635","DFA;regular expressions;deep packet inspection;alphabet compression;multi-byte matching","Pattern matching;Indexes;Inspection;Educational institutions;Memory management;Automata;Parallel processing","computational complexity;deterministic automata;finite automata;pattern matching;security of data","multibyte pattern matching;high speed deep packet inspection;intrusion detection system;intrusion prevention system;deterministic finite automata;regular expression matching;processing complexity;stride-k speculative parallel pattern matching;stride-k DFA compression technique;alphabet compression table;ACT;stride-2 SPPM","","3","","24","IEEE","29 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While many intrusion detection systems (IDSes) have been adapted to monitor ICS, they cannot detect malicious network packets from a compromised PLC that con-form to the network protocol. A domain expert needs to manually construct IDS rules to model a PLC’s behavior. That approach is time-consuming and error-prone. Alternatively, machine learning can infer a PLC’s behavior model from network traces, but that model may be inaccurate due to a lack of high-quality training data. This paper presents CoToRu - a toolchain that takes in the PLC’s code to automatically generate a comprehensive set of IDS rules. CoToRu comprises (1) an analyzer that parses PLC code to build a state transition table for modeling the PLC’s behavior, and (2) a generator that instantiates IDS rules for detecting deviations in PLC behavior. The generated rules can be imported into Zeek IDS to detect various attacks. We apply CoToRu to a power grid testbed and show that our generated rules provide superior performance compared to existing IDSes, including those based on statistical analysis, invariant-checking, and machine learning.

With the growth in the number of Cloud Service Providers, many enterprises and organizations can use and associate services from multiple providers. There may be many Internet protocols for service access standards that are used to ensure interoperability between users browser and Web server, such as Representational State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Each service has its specific characteristics such as authentication and security requirements. Hence, Cloud providers attempt to lock customers into proprietary interfaces so consumers can find themselves at not expects inevitable vendor lock-in. Therefore, the focus of our paper is to propose a solution to this problem by using Cloud intermediate between Cloud providers and consumer in heterogeneous Cloud environments interfaces. This is to achieve benefits such as standardization and interoperability, minimizing lock-in of Cloud providers. To reach such benefits, we propose a Cloud SaaS based on two interfaces and an internet component. These interfaces are used in Cloud Consumer and Provider sides and therefore guarantee communication between Cloud Consumer and Provider using different Internet protocols for Web service access such as REST and SOAP. Our approach guarantees interoperability and standardization in heterogeneous Cloud based environments because in this case Cloud Consumer and Provider using REST interface can communicate easily with Cloud Provider and Consumer using SOAP interface.","","978-1-4673-8712-5","10.1109/WICT.2015.7489640","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489640","CloudComputing;Heterogeneous Cloud;SOAP;REST;Web Service;Standarization;Interoperability","Cloud computing;Standards;Simple object access protocol;Interoperability;Protocols;Browsers","cloud computing;file servers;open systems;standardisation;Web services","cloud SaaS;interoperability;standardization;heterogeneous cloud-based environment;cloud service providers;Internet protocols;Web server;Web browser;cloud consumer-and-provider sides;Web service access","","","","8","IEEE","13 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With their inherent nature, active (Event- Condition-Action or ECA) rules are prospective candidates to carry out change detection and to provide access control. Current systems or models do not provide a flexible mechanism for enforcing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) standard and its extensions in a seamless way, and do not adapt to policy or role structure changes in enterprises, which are indispensable to make RBAC usable in diverse domains. In this paper we will show how On-When-Then-Else authorization rules (or enhanced ECA rules) are used for enforcing RBAC standard and its extensions such as generalized temporal RBAC, control flow dependency constraints, privacy-aware RBAC, and so forth in a seamless way. Furthermore, these rules also provide active security. Large enterprises have hundreds of roles, which requires thousands of rules for providing access control, and generating these rules manually is error-prone and a cognitive-burden for non-computer specialists. Thus, in this paper, we will discuss briefly how these authorization rules can be automatically (or semi-automatically) generated from high level specifications of enterprise access control policies. We will also discuss the implementation using Sentinel+, an active object oriented system.","","0-7695-2657-8","10.1109/ICDE.2005.179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1647810","","Authorization;Access control;Security;Object oriented modeling;Information technology;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Delay;Error correction;Privacy","","","","6","","32","IEEE","5 Jul 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton (AC-DFA) based solutions produce deterministic throughput and are widely used in today's DPI systems such as Snort [1] and ClamAV [2], the high memory requirement of AC-DFA (due to the large number of state transitions in AC-DFA) inhibits efficient hardware implementation to achieve high performance. Some recent work [3], [4] has shown that the AC-DFA can be reduced to a character trie that contains only the forward transitions by incorporating pipelined processing. But they have limitations in either handling long patterns or extensions to support multi-character input per clock cycle to achieve high throughput. This paper generalizes the problem and proves formally that a linear pipeline with H stages can remove all cross transitions to the top H levels of a AC-DFA. A novel and scalable pipeline architecture for memory-efficient multi-pattern string matching is then presented. The architecture can be easily extended to support multi-character input per clock cycle by mapping a compressed AC-DFA [5] onto multiple pipelines. Simulation using Snort and ClamAV pattern sets shows that a 8-stage pipeline can remove more than 99% of the transitions in the original AC-DFA. The implementation on a state-of-the-art field programmable gate array (FPGA) shows that our architecture can store on a single FPGA device the full set of string patterns from the latest Snort rule set. Our FPGA implementation sustains 10+ Gbps throughput, while consuming a small amount of on-chip logic resources. Also desirable scalability is achieved: the increase in resource requirement of our solution is sub-linear with the throughput improvement.","1530-2075","978-1-4244-6443-2","10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470374","Deep packet inspection;DFA;FPGA;pipeline;string matching","Throughput;Pipelines;Field programmable gate arrays;Clocks;Intrusion detection;Inspection;Automata;Hardware;Memory architecture;Programmable logic arrays","field programmable gate arrays;finite automata;pipeline processing;security of data;string matching","network intrusion detection;anti-virus systems;high-speed deep packet inspection;Aho-Corasick deterministic finite automaton;Snort;ClamAV;pipelined processing;linear pipeline;scalable pipeline architecture;field programmable gate array;scalable multipipeline architecture;high performance multipattern string matching;memory-efficient multipattern string matching;multicharacter input","","18","1","28","IEEE","24 May 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are investigating the exploitation of idle times in network resources based on a complete mode change in a candidate node. After the detection that some node is idle, a mode-switcher boots a new operating system that will work over a separate disk partition. After the boot phase the node is linked to a logical network topology and is available to receive jobs. Users can allocate nodes from this virtual cluster through a standard frontend as they would do in a ""conventional"" cluster. Because nodes may leave and join this virtual machine we use a distributed processor management to allow user applications to cope with this dynamic resource behavior.

But operating conditions within this domain strongly favour malicious actors over legitimate operators seeking to provide security and protect systems and information. Technical capabilities to establish dominance and cause damage in this domain are widely distributed, but legal and ethical constraints prevent legitimate actors from using them to their full potential. Within this context, net neutrality presents a limiting factor on the capability of legitimate actors to respond to harmful activity in cyberspace whose common aim is to install and uphold a technical imbalance. Under the principle of net neutrality, each data packet must be transmitted with equal priority, irrespective of its source, destination, content or purpose. This is disadvantageous to cyber defence. Comparisons to jungle or arctic warfare, where operating conditions are neutral and degrade the performance of each combatant side equally, are invalid, as malicious operators are capable of technically manipulating data traffic to their favour. While both malicious and legitimate actors may have comparable capabilities, legitimate actors are bound to legal and political restrictions, making them immobile in several cyber warfare scenarios. Transferring the principles of net neutrality to real life scenarios corresponds to depriving military, police and emergency operators from any privilege that allows them to respond to an incident - in effect, depriving them of their blue lights and emergency powers even in severe incidents targeting critical infrastructure that may threaten civilian lives. This paper investigates the potential opportunities and challenges of an adjustment to the principle of net neutrality to facilitate defensive action by legitimate actors; how this adjustment could contribute to regaining control in congested cyber domains in the case of national or international cyber incidents; and the risks associated. The different ways of dealing with net neutrality in cyber defence situations in the EU, UK and Russia are compared. Particular focus is put on the organisations and capabilities needed to establish technical sovereignty in multi-domain networks, including consideration of the acceptability of outsourcing the task of upholding cyber sovereignty to external institutions.","2325-5374","978-9-9499-9043-6","10.23919/CYCON.2018.8405015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8405015","net neutrality;cyber defence;cyber security;net regulation","Network neutrality;Critical infrastructure;Cyberspace;Cyber warfare;Internet","computer crime;Internet","congested domain;operating conditions;legitimate operators;technical capabilities;legitimate actors;net neutrality;malicious operators;technically manipulating data traffic;cyber warfare scenarios;police;emergency operators;national incidents;international cyber incidents;critical national infrastructure;highly contested domain;malicious actors;unprotected individual users;cyber defence;EU;UK;Russia;multidomain networks","","2","","","","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a novel machine unlearning method, called virtual federated learning approach (ViFLa), which groups training data based on estimated unlearning probability and treats each group as a virtual client in the federated learning framework. Since the virtual clients are physically in the same machine, ViFLa only leverages the concept of data/local models isolation in federated learning without incurring any network communication. ViFLa adopts an attention-based aggregation method called enhanced class distribution weighted sum (ECDWS) to tackle the nonindependent and identically distributed (non-iid) data problem caused by the data grouping strategy. It also introduces a new state transition ring mechanism into the statistical query (SQ) learning framework to update the local model of each virtual client quickly. Using real-world IoT traffic data, we showcase the benefit of ViFLa regarding its efficiency and completeness for model updates in the context of IoT traffic anomaly detection.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3214840","Huawei Technologies Canada Company Ltd., under Huawei–UVic(grant numbers:6366); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9927728","Internet of Things (IoT) traffic anomaly detection;machine unlearning;model update","Data models;Training;Anomaly detection;Internet of Things;Training data;Federated learning;Predictive models","computer network security;data handling;deep learning (artificial intelligence);firmware;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","anomaly detection model;attention-based aggregation method;called virtual federated learning approach;data grouping strategy;deep learning-based detection models;device firmware upgrades;estimated unlearning probability;fast model update;federated learning framework;IoT traffic anomaly detection;mislabeled samples;model updates;novel machine unlearning method;real-world IoT traffic data;statistical query learning framework;traffic anomaly detection systems;ViFLa;virtual client","","","","30","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Privacy is a huge concern for IoT devices as personal information is constantly being shared through them. Though the best industrial standards like end-to-end encryption are being followed to ensure content-based privacy, contextual privacy concerns still exist. This study focuses on user activity inference attacks, where a passive network observer can infer the private in-home activity of a user by analyzing encrypted IoT traffic metadata. Most of the previous solutions addressing these attacks have either reduced the usability of the devices, increased data overhead, or failed against packet-level signature-based attack scenarios. This study introduces a new defense mechanism that combines dummy packet generation with dynamic link padding. This process makes it difficult for the adversary to avail contextual information about the state of the device (ON or OFF), along with the temporal information (time of state change) from encrypted IoT traffic metadata. We reverse the packet-level signature-based attacks to get device-specific signatures, which helps us generate dummy traffic for the duration of device-specific signatures. Consequently, this results in increased false positives for device state identifications and low traffic overhead. We simulate a state-of-the-art attack scenario to test and vindicate our solution over existing data sets.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3126453","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609087","Contextual privacy;Internet of Things (IoT);smart devices;traffic shaping","Smart homes;Privacy;Object recognition;Internet of Things;Metadata;Information technology;Encryption","computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;home automation;Internet of Things;telecommunication traffic","preserving contextual privacy;smart home IoT devices;dynamic traffic shaping;physical devices;personal information;end-to-end encryption;contextual privacy concerns;user activity inference attacks;passive network observer;in-home activity;encrypted IoT traffic metadata;increased data overhead;packet-level signature-based attack scenarios;dummy packet generation;dynamic link padding;contextual information;temporal information;packet-level signature-based attacks;device-specific signatures;dummy traffic;device state identifications;low traffic overhead;state-of-the-art attack scenario","","2","","20","IEEE","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant strategies for CGRAs apply either temporal or spatial scheme, including redundancy, periodic detection, workload balancing, and reconfiguration, failing to exploit the feature of dynamic and partial reconfiguration of CGRAs. Also, vulnerable judging circuits and inflexible mode shifting bottleneck the reliability design of fault-tolerant CGRAs. This paper proposes a novel multi-mode fault-tolerant framework for CGRAs, which combines spatial-redundant data-paths with temporal-redundant voters and thus reduces the vulnerable judging circuits while balancing the performance and reliability. This framework can also enable a changing reliability level at runtime via an online configuration transformation method based on pre-compiled patterns. Within the proposed framework, we systematically searched the design space spanning various combinations of the mainstream schemes with a Markov process model to compare the effectiveness and accordingly selected five points as available modes in our design after comprehensive consideration of fault tolerance and time overhead on CGRA. The framework is comprehensively evaluated on a cycle-accurate CGRA simulator, considering both permanent and transient faults. The experimental results show that the fault coverage rate of single transient faults or permanent faults has increased from 71.74% to 93.84%, which means the fault tolerance of the system has been increased by 31.03% compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

A challenging problem is the coexistence of 5G and other networks with fair, reliable, and efficient sharing of the unlicensed spectrum. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-enhanced distributed spectrum sharing scheme for coexisting multiple operators and multiple WiFi APs. We design a novel lightweight and efficient consensus mechanism, named Proof of Strategy (PoG). In this consensus mechanism, the problem of spectrum sharing is used as a consensus puzzle, and the part of the unlicensed spectrum is used as the ‘fee’ of miners. With such a design, the computing overhead of the consensus process is expected to be reduced significantly. We develop a non-cooperative game to analyze the behavior of the miners and obtain a symmetric Bayesian Nash equilibrium under the uniform distribution of mining cost estimation. It can be found mathematically and experimentally that the strategy of the winner tends to maximize the system revenue by sharing the unlicensed spectrum resource. Furthermore, to reduce the impact of heavy interactions on system throughput, the operation of WiFi APs in the proposed scheme can be adaptively switched between ‘contention mode’ and ‘blockchain mode’ according to the network traffic load. The dynamic behavior is constructed as an evolutionary game, and the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium points are proved by theoretical analysis. Simulations demonstrated the fairness and effectiveness of the proposed blockchain-based scheme and the mode switching method for distributed spectrum sharing by heterogeneous wireless networks.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3170577","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFE0117500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171104); EU H2020 Project COSAFE(grant numbers:MSCA-RISE-2018-824019); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme; Marie Skłodowska-Curie(grant numbers:824019,101022280); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9764623","Blockchain;spectrum sharing;unlicensed spectrum","Wireless fidelity;Blockchains;Wireless networks;Resource management;Cellular networks;Throughput;Switches","Bayes methods;blockchains;cognitive radio;game theory;radio spectrum management;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","blockchain enhanced coexistence;heterogeneous networks;highly congested licensed spectrum;unlicensed spectrum resource;fair sharing;blockchain-enhanced distributed spectrum;efficient consensus mechanism;spectrum sharing;consensus puzzle;consensus process;network traffic load;blockchain-based scheme;heterogeneous wireless networks","","2","","39","IEEE","27 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on the architecture of edge-cloud collaborative computing, an automatic high voltage transformer verification technology is proposed considering the applicability in various fields. a vehicle mounted verification device is designed, on which the verification computing at edge side can be realized. The working state model of current transformer is built based on the closed-loop ARMAX model. Combing the ARMAX Model identification with MOEA/D tendency guidance, the characteristic of fault mode for high voltage transformer is proposed. The comparative validation experiment is conducted for 30 consecutive days at a 15VA current transformer and a3.75VA current transformer. The results show that the estimated value of ratio error can reflect actual state changes, which can be used to identify the fault status of the high voltage current transformer. The automatic high voltage transformer verification is achieved with more security for the operator, and it has the value of promotion and application.","","978-1-6654-6735-3","10.1109/CCET55412.2022.9906363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9906363","high voltage transformer;automatic verification;edge-cloud collaborative computing;ARMAX;MOEAlD","Fault diagnosis;Current transformers;Computational modeling;Collaboration;High-voltage techniques;Computer architecture;Rail transportation","autoregressive moving average processes;closed loop systems;cloud computing;current transformers;distribution networks;fault diagnosis;harmonic analysis;mathematical analysis;power apparatus;power transformers;railway engineering;railways;temperature measurement;transformer cores","automatic current transformer verification technology;high-speed railway power;edge-cloud collaborative computing;key power equipment;automatic high voltage transformer verification technology;verification device;verification computing;working state model;closed-loop ARMAX model;ARMAX Model identification;15VA current transformer;a3.75VA current transformer;high voltage current transformer;apparent power 15.0 VA","","","","14","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"IEEE Draft Standard for Biometric Privacy","",,"IEEE P2410-2021/D10, February 2021","12 Feb 2021","2021","","","1","52","The Standard for Biometric Privacy (SBP) provides private identity assertion. SBP supersedes the prior IEEE Std 2410(TM)-2019 by including a formal specification for privacy and biometrics such that a conforming SBP system does not incur GDPR, CCPA, BIPA or HIPAA privacy obligations. Homomorphic encryption ensures the biometric payload is always one-way encrypted with no need for key management and provides full privacy by ensuring plaintext biometrics are never received by the SBP server. The SBP implementation includes software running on a client device and on the SPB server. Pluggable components are used to replace legacy functionality to allow rapid integration into existing operating environments. The SBP implementation allows the systems to meet security needs by using the application programming interface, whether the underlying system is a relational database management system or a search engine. The SBP implementation functionality offers a “point-and-cut” mechanism to add the appropriate security to the production systems as well as to the systems in development. The architecture is language neutral, allowing Representational State Transfer (REST ), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide the communication interface. This document describes the essential methodology to SBP.","","978-1-5044-7386-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9354144","admin console;application;biometric-driven device;biometrics;privacy;client device IDS;IDS cluster;IEEE Std 2410(TM);Jena Rules;liveness;original site admin;SBP admin;SBP cluster;SBP IDS;SBP server;site admin;trusted adjudicated data;user","IEEE Standards;Biometrics;Privacy;Servers","","","","","","","","12 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Standards"

A fundamental challenge is ARM disassembly. ARM, particularly AArch32, has a number of unique features making disassembly distinct from x86 disassembly, such as the mixing of ARM and Thumb instruction modes, implicit mode switching within an application, and more prevalent use of inlined data. Existing techniques cannot achieve high accuracy when binaries become complex and have undergone obfuscation. We propose a novel ARM binary disassembly technique that is particularly designed to address challenges in legacy code for 32-bit ARM binaries. It features a lightweight superset instruction interpretation method to derive rich semantic information and a graph-theory based method that aggregates such information to produce final results. Our comparative evaluation with a number of state-of-the-art disassemblers, including Ghidra, IDA, P-Disasm, XDA, D-Disasm, and Spedi, on thousands of binaries generated from SPEC2000 and SPEC2006 with various settings, and real-world applications collected online show that our technique D-ARM substantially outperforms the baselines.","2375-1207","978-1-6654-9336-9","10.1109/SP46215.2023.10179307","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10179307","Program-and-binary-analysis","Privacy;Codes;Aggregates;Semantics;Thumb;Switches;Static analysis","","","","","","51","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A “source–storage–load” coordinated master–slave control strategy is proposed in this study to address the aforementioned issues. The system voltage and frequency will be stable as long as the output frequency and voltage of the master resource are stable. Furthermore, it can fully utilize the power supply capacity of resources to support the supply–demand balance. The following tasks are included in the proposed strategy: 1) to improve the operational security in the face of load disruption, a source–storage–load coordinated control method based on the “ramping speed” ratio is proposed, which can quickly restore the balance of supply and demand; 2) to improve the communication reliability in the face of interruption, a channel planning method is proposed, which can address the communication interruption problem by constructing an internal network among source–storage–load; and 3) to improve the mode switching stability of resources subjected to external disturbance, the external disturbance suppression and stability analysis involved in the regulation process are completed using sliding-mode control and small signal model methods. Related case studies are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2023.3253136","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61833008); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China(grant numbers:BK20220395); Leading Technology Foundation Research Project of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20202011); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Universities(grant numbers:22KJB470024); Jiangsu Provincial Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:BE2020001); Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China(grant numbers:E2020203139); Natural Science Foundation of Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications(grant numbers:NY222032); National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2019R1A5A8080290); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10081464","Balance;communication interruption;load disturbance;master–slave control;microgrid (MG);source–storage–load","Regulation;Frequency control;Voltage control;Switches;Microgrids;Communication networks;Centralized control","","","","","","","IEEE","27 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
